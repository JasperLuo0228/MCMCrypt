- scramble_text.py
  - Rewrote scrambling logic to preserve formatting characters (newline, tab, space)
    ➜ Replaced previous `.replace("\n", " ")` logic with direct character scan
    ➜ Used conditional logic to scramble only 82-character alphabet from az_list()
  - Switched from printing to file writing
    ➜ Scrambled result now saved as 'scrambled.txt' with UTF-8 encoding
  - Added import of az_list() and generate_random_permutation_map() from utils.py

- utils.py

  - az_list()
    ➜ Modified from just A–Z/a–z to full 82-character alphabet including digits, punctuation, and space.
    ➜ Purpose: Supports broader character coverage for realistic email/message decoding.

  - generate_random_permutation_map()
    ➜ New version allows group-wise shuffling:
        ▸ Uppercase ↔ Uppercase
        ▸ Lowercase ↔ Lowercase
        ▸ Digits, punctuation, and space shuffled within their own group.
    ➜ Ensures structured scrambling useful for decoding and MCMC stability.

  - scramble_text()
    ➜ Uses `p_map.get(c, c)` to leave characters unchanged if not in map.
    ➜ Adds robustness for edge characters (like tab, newline, emojis) that shouldn’t be scrambled.

  - move_one_step()
    ➜ dynamically pulls keys from current `p_map`, supporting all allowed characters.
    ➜ Enables permutation editing across all 82 characters.

  - compute_statistics()
    ➜ Normalizes tabs/newlines to space: `replace("\n", " ")` etc.
    ➜ Filters only the 82-character alphabet using `az_list()`.
    ➜ Ensures consistent character indexing across training and decoding.
    ➜ Adds Laplace smoothing (starting transition matrix with ones) to avoid zero-probabilities.
