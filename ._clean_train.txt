his boats and i believe that we are ready to burn oursprince vasili always spoke languidly like an actor repeating a stalepart anna pavlovna scherer on the contrary despite her forty yearsoverflowed with animation and impulsiveness to be an enthusiast hadbecome her social vocation and sometimes even when she did not feellike it she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint theexpectations of those who knew her the subdued smile which though itdid not suit her faded features always played round her lips expressedas in a spoiled child a continual consciousness of her charming defectwhich she neither wished nor could nor considered it necessary tocorrectin the midst of a conversation on political matters anna pavlovna burstoutoh dont speak to me of austria perhaps i dont understand

heardi shall be delighted to meet them said the prince but tell me headded with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to himthough the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of hisvisit is it true that the dowager empress wants baron funke to beappointed first secretary at vienna the baron by all accounts is a poorcreatureprince vasili wished to obtain this post for his son but others weretrying through the dowager empress marya fedorovna to secure it for thebaronanna pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she noranyone else had a right to criticize what the empress desired or waspleased withbaron funke has been recommended to the dowager empress by her sisterwas all she said in a dry and mournful toneas she named the empress anna pavlovnas face suddenly assumed anexpression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled withsadness and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustriouspatroness she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron funkebeaucoup destime and again her face clouded over with sadnessthe prince was silent and looked indifferent but with the womanly andcourtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her anna pavlovna wishedboth to rebuke him for daring to speak as he had done of a manrecommended to the empress and at the same time to console him so shesaidnow about your family do you know that since your daughter came outeveryone has been enraptured by her they say she is amazinglybeautifulthe prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitudei often think she continued after a short pause drawing nearer tothe prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political andsocial topics were ended and the time had come for intimateconversationi often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life aredistributed why has fate given you two such splendid children i dontspeak of anatole your youngest i dont like him she added in a toneadmitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows two such charmingchildren and really you appreciate them less than anyone and so youdont deserve to have themand she smiled her ecstatic smilei cant help it said the prince lavater would have said i

mentioned at her majestysand you were pitiedthe prince answered nothing but she looked at him significantlyawaiting a reply he frownedwhat would you have me do he said at last you know i did all afather could for their education and they have both turned out foolshippolyte is at least a quiet fool but anatole is an active one thatis the only difference between them he said this smiling in a way morenatural and animated than usual so that the wrinkles round his mouthvery clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasantand why are children born to such men as you if you were not a fatherthere would be nothing i could reproach you with said anna pavlovnalooking up pensivelyi am your faithful slave and to you alone i can confess that mychildren are the bane of my life it is the cross i have to bear thatis how i explain it to myself it cant be helpedhe said no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by agesture anna pavlovna meditatedhave you never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole sheasked they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and though idont feel that weakness in myself as yet i know a little person who isvery unhappy with her father she is a relation of yours princess marybolkonskayaprince vasili did not reply though with the quickness of memory andperception befitting a man of the world he indicated by a movement ofthe head that he was considering this informationdo you know he said at last evidently unable to check the sadcurrent of his thoughts that anatole is costing me forty thousandrubles a year and he went on after a pause what will it be in fiveyears if he goes on like this presently he added thats what wefathers have to put up with is this princess of yours richher father is very rich and stingy he lives in the country he is thewellknown prince bolkonski who had to retire from the army under thelate emperor and was nicknamed the king of prussia he is very cleverbut eccentric and a bore the poor girl

cap who had comesailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive andslowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt anna pavlovnamentioned each ones name and then left themeach visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom notone of them knew not one of them wanted to know and not one of themcared about anna pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful andsolemn interest and silent approval the aunt spoke to each of them inthe same words about their health and her own and the health of hermajesty who thank god was better today and each visitor thoughpoliteness prevented his showing impatience left the old woman with asense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not returnto her the whole eveningthe young princess bolkonskaya had brought some work in a goldembroidered velvet bag her pretty little upper lip on which a delicatedark down was just perceptible was too short for her teeth but itlifted all the more sweetly and was especially charming when sheoccasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip as is always the casewith a thoroughly attractive woman her defectthe shortness of herupper lip and her halfopen mouthseemed to be her own special andpeculiar form of beauty everyone brightened at the sight of this prettyyoung woman so soon to become a mother so full of life and health andcarrying her burden so lightly old men and dull dispirited young oneswho looked at her after being in her company and talking to her alittle while felt as if they too were becoming like her full of lifeand health all who talked to her and at each word saw her bright smileand the constant gleam of her white teeth thought that they were in aspecially amiable mood that daythe little princess went round the table with quick short swayingsteps her workbag on her arm and gaily spreading out her dress satdown on a sofa near the silver samovar as if all she was doing was apleasure to herself and to all around her i have brought my worksaid she in french displaying her bag and addressing all presentmind annette i hope you have not played a wicked trick on me sheadded turning to her hostess you wrote that it was to be quite asmall reception and just see how badly i am dressed and she spreadout her arms to show her shortwaisted lacetrimmed dainty gray dressgirdled with a broad ribbon just below the breastsoyez tranquille lise you will always be prettier than anyone elsereplied anna pavlovnayou know said the princess in the same tone of voice and still infrench turning to a general my husband is deserting me he is goingto get himself killed tell me what this wretched war is for sheadded addressing prince vasili and without waiting for an answer sheturned to speak to his daughter the beautiful helenewhat a delightful woman this little princess is said prince vasili toanna pavlovnaone of the next arrivals was a stout heavily built young man withclosecropped hair spectacles the lightcolored breeches fashionableat that time a very high ruffle and a brown dress coat this stoutyoung man was an illegitimate son of count bezukhov a wellknowngrandee of catherines time who now lay dying in moscow the young manhad not yet entered either the military or civil service as he had onlyjust returned from abroad where he had been educated and this was hisfirst appearance in society anna pavlovna greeted him with the nod sheaccorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room but in spite ofthis lowestgrade greeting a look of anxiety and fear as at the sightof something too large and unsuited to the place came over her facewhen she saw pierre enter though he was certainly rather bigger thanthe other men in the room her anxiety could only have reference to theclever though shy but observant and natural expression whichdistinguished him from everyone else in that drawing roomit is very good of you monsieur pierre to come and visit a poorinvalid said anna pavlovna exchanging an alarmed glance with her auntas she conducted him to herpierre murmured something unintelligible and continued to look round asif in search of something on his way to the aunt he bowed to the littleprincess with a pleased smile as to an intimate acquaintanceanna pavlovnas alarm was justified for pierre turned away from theaunt without waiting to hear her speech about her majestys health annapavlovna in dismay detained him with the words do you know the abbemorio he is a most interesting manyes i have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace and it is veryinteresting but hardly feasibleyou think so rejoined anna pavlovna in order to say something and getaway to attend to her duties as hostess but pierre now committed areverse act of impoliteness first he had left a lady before she hadfinished speaking to him and now he continued to speak to another whowished to get away with his head bent and his big feet spread aparthe began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbes plan chimericalwe will talk of it later said anna pavlovna with a smileand having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave sheresumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch readyto help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag as theforeman of a spinning mill when he has set the hands to work goesround and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one thatcreaks or makes more noise than it should and hastens to check themachine or set it in proper motion so anna pavlovna moved about herdrawing room approaching now a silent now a toonoisy group and by aword or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steadyproper and regular motion but amid these cares her anxiety aboutpierre was evident she kept an anxious watch on him when he approachedthe group round mortemart to listen to what was being said there andagain when he passed to another group whose center was the abbepierre had been educated abroad and this reception at anna pavlovnaswas the first he had attended in russia he knew that all theintellectual lights of petersburg were gathered there and like a childin a toyshop did not know which way to look afraid of missing anyclever conversation that was to be heard seeing the selfconfident andrefined expression on the faces of those present he was always expectingto hear something very profound at last he came up to morio here theconversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunityto express his own views as young people are fond of doinganna pavlovnas reception was in full swing the spindles hummedsteadily and ceaselessly on all sides with the exception of the auntbeside whom sat only one elderly lady who with her thin careworn facewas rather out of place in this brilliant society the whole company hadsettled into three groups one chiefly masculine had formed round theabbe another of young people was grouped round the beautiful princesshelene prince vasilis daughter and the little princess bolkonskayavery pretty and rosy though rather too plump for her age the thirdgroup was gathered round mortemart and anna pavlovnathe vicomte was a nicelooking young man with soft features and polishedmanners who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out ofpoliteness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle inwhich he found himself anna pavlovna was obviously serving him up as atreat to her guests as a clever maitre dhotel serves up as a speciallychoice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in thekitchen would have cared to eat so anna pavlovna served up to herguests first the vicomte and then the abbe as peculiarly choicemorsels the group about mortemart immediately began discussing themurder of the duc denghien the vicomte said that the duc denghien hadperished by his own magnanimity and that there were particular reasonsfor buonapartes hatred of himah yes do tell us all about it vicomte said anna pavlovna with apleasant feeling that there was something a la louis xv in the sound ofthat sentence contez nous cela vicomtethe vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness tocomply anna pavlovna arranged a group round him inviting everyone tolisten to his talethe vicomte knew the duc personally whispered anna pavlovna to one ofthe guests the vicomte is a wonderful raconteur said she to anotherhow evidently he belongs to the best society said she to a third andthe vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and mostadvantageous style like a wellgarnished joint of roast beef on a hotdishthe vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smilecome over here helene dear said anna pavlovna to the beautifulyoung princess who was sitting some way off the center of anothergroupthe princess smiled she rose with the same unchanging smile with whichshe had first entered the roomthe smile of a perfectly beautifulwoman with a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss andivy with a gleam of white shoulders glossy hair and sparklingdiamonds she passed between the men who made way for her not lookingat any of them but smiling on all as if graciously allowing each theprivilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders backand bosomwhich in the fashion of those days were very much exposedand she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she movedtoward anna pavlovna helene was so lovely that not only did she notshow any trace of coquetry but on the contrary she even appeared shy ofher unquestionable and all too victorious beauty she seemed to wishbut to be unable to diminish its effecthow lovely said everyone who saw her and the vicomte lifted hisshoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinarywhen she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with herunchanging smilemadame i doubt my ability before such an audience said he smilinglyinclining his headthe princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considereda reply unnecessary she smilingly waited all the time the story wasbeing told she sat upright glancing now at her beautiful round armaltered in shape by its pressure on the table now at her still morebeautiful bosom on which she readjusted a diamond necklace from timeto time she smoothed the folds of her dress and whenever the storyproduced an effect she glanced at anna pavlovna at once adopted justthe expression she saw on the maid of honors face and again relapsedinto her radiant smilethe little princess had also left the tea table and followed helenewait a moment ill get my work now then what are you thinkingof she went on turning to prince hippolyte fetch me my workbagthere was a general movement as the princess smiling and talkingmerrily to everyone at once sat down and gaily arranged herself in herseatnow i am all right she said and asking the vicomte to begin shetook up her workprince hippolyte having brought the workbag joined the circle andmoving a chair close to hers seated himself beside herle charmant hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance tohis beautiful sister but yet more by the fact that in spite of thisresemblance he was exceedingly ugly his features were like hissisters but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous selfsatisfied youthful and constant smile of animation and by thewonderful classic beauty of her figure his face on the contrary wasdulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen selfconfidence while his body was thin and weak his eyes nose and mouthall seemed puckered into a vacant wearied grimace and his arms andlegs always fell into unnatural positionsits not going to be a ghost story said he sitting down beside theprincess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette as if without thisinstrument he could not begin to speakwhy no my dear fellow said the astonished narrator shrugging hisshouldersbecause i hate ghost stories said prince hippolyte in a tone whichshowed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he haduttered themhe spoke with such selfconfidence that his hearers could not be surewhether what he said was very witty or very stupid he was dressed in adarkgreen dress coat knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nympheeffrayee as he called it shoes and silk stockingsthe vicomte told his tale very neatly it was an anecdote then currentto the effect that the duc denghien had gone secretly to paris to visitmademoiselle george that at her house he came upon bonaparte who alsoenjoyed the famous actress favors and that in his presence napoleonhappened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subjectand was thus at the ducs mercy the latter spared him and thismagnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid by deaththe story was very pretty and interesting especially at the point wherethe rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladies lookedagitatedcharming said anna pavlovna with an inquiring glance at the littleprincesscharming whispered the little princess sticking the needle into herwork as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the storyprevented her from going on with itthe vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefullyprepared to continue but just then anna pavlovna who had kept awatchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her noticed that he wastalking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe so she hurried to therescue pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe aboutthe balance of power and the latter evidently interested by the youngmans simpleminded eagerness was explaining his pet theory both weretalking and listening too eagerly and too naturally which was why annapavlovna disapprovedthe means are the balance of power in europe and the rights of thepeople the abbe was saying it is only necessary for one powerfulnation like russiabarbaric as she is said to beto place herselfdisinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object themaintenance of the balance of power of europe and it would save theworldbut how are you to get that balance pierre was beginningat that moment anna pavlovna came up and looking severely at pierreasked the italian how he stood russian climate the italians faceinstantly changed and assumed an offensively affected sugaryexpression evidently habitual to him when conversing with womeni am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of thesociety more especially of the feminine society in which i have hadthe honor of being received that i have not yet had time to think ofthe climate said henot letting the abbe and pierre escape anna pavlovna the moreconveniently to keep them under observation brought them into thelarger circlejust then another visitor entered the drawing room prince andrewbolkonski the little princess husband he was a very handsome youngman of medium height with firm clearcut features everything abouthim from his weary bored expression to his quiet measured stepoffered a most striking contrast to his quiet little wife it wasevident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room but hadfound them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen tothem and among all these faces that he found so tedious none seemed tobore him so much as that of his pretty wife he turned away from herwith a grimace that distorted his handsome face kissed anna pavlovnashand and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole companyyou are off to the war prince said anna pavlovnageneral kutuzov said bolkonski speaking french and stressing thelast syllable of the generals name like a frenchman has been pleasedto take me as an aidedecampand lise your wifeshe will go to the countryare you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wifeandre said his wife addressing her husband in the same coquettishmanner in which she spoke to other men the vicomte has been telling ussuch a tale about mademoiselle george and buonaparteprince andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away pierre who from themoment prince andrew entered the room had watched him with gladaffectionate eyes now came up and took his arm before he looked roundprince andrew frowned again expressing his annoyance with whoever wastouching his arm but when he saw pierres beaming face he gave him anunexpectedly kind and pleasant smilethere now so you too are in the great world said he to pierrei knew you would be here replied pierre i will come to supper withyou may i he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomtewho was continuing his storyno impossible said prince andrew laughing and pressing pierreshand to show that there was no need to ask the question he wished tosay something more but at that moment prince vasili and his daughtergot up to go and the two young men rose to let them passyou must excuse me dear vicomte said prince vasili to the frenchmanholding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his risingthis unfortunate fete at the ambassadors deprives me of a pleasureand obliges me to interrupt you i am very sorry to leave yourenchanting party said he turning to anna pavlovnahis daughter princess helene passed between the chairs lightlyholding up the folds of her dress and the smile shone still moreradiantly on her beautiful face pierre gazed at her with rapturousalmost frightened eyes as she passed himvery lovely said prince andrewvery said pierrein passing prince vasili seized pierres hand and said to anna pavlovnaeducate this bear for me he has been staying with me a whole month andthis is the first time i have seen him in society nothing is sonecessary for a young man as the society of clever womenanna pavlovna smiled and promised to take pierre in hand she knew hisfather to be a connection of prince vasilis the elderly lady who hadbeen sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook prince vasiliin the anteroom all the affectation of interest she had assumed hadleft her kindly and tearworn face and it now expressed only anxiety andfearhow about my son boris prince said she hurrying after him into theanteroom i cant remain any longer in petersburg tell me what news imay take back to my poor boyalthough prince vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely to theelderly lady even betraying some impatience she gave him aningratiating and appealing smile and took his hand that he might not goawaywhat would it cost you to say a word to the emperor and then he wouldbe transferred to the guards at once said shebelieve me princess i am ready to do all i can answered princevasili but it is difficult for me to ask the emperor i should adviseyou to appeal to rumyantsev through prince golitsyn that would be thebest waythe elderly lady was a princess drubetskaya belonging to one of thebest families in russia but she was poor and having long been out ofsociety had lost her former influential connections she had now come topetersburg to procure an appointment in the guards for her only son itwas in fact solely to meet prince vasili that she had obtained aninvitation to anna pavlovnas reception and had sat listening to thevicomtes story prince vasilis words frightened her an embitteredlook clouded her once handsome face but only for a moment then shesmiled again and clutched prince vasilis arm more tightlylisten to me prince said she i have never yet asked you foranything and i never will again nor have i ever reminded you of myfathers friendship for you but now i entreat you for gods sake to dothis for my sonand i shall always regard you as a benefactor sheadded hurriedly no dont be angry but promise i have asked golitsynand he has refused be the kindhearted man you always were she saidtrying to smile though tears were in her eyespapa we shall be late said princess helene turning her beautifulhead and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stoodwaiting by the doorinfluence in society however is a capital which has to be economizedif it is to last prince vasili knew this and having once realized thatif he asked on behalf of all who begged of him he would soon be unableto ask for himself he became chary of using his influence but inprincess drubetskayas case he felt after her second appeal somethinglike qualms of conscience she had reminded him of what was quite truehe had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his careermoreover he could see by her manners that she was one of those womenmostly motherswho having once made up their minds will not restuntil they have gained their end and are prepared if necessary to go oninsisting day after day and hour after hour and even to make scenesthis last consideration moved himmy dear anna mikhaylovna said he with his usual familiarity andweariness of tone it is almost impossible for me to do what you askbut to prove my devotion to you and how i respect your fathers memoryi will do the impossibleyour son shall be transferred to the guardshere is my hand on it

daughter in the same tone as before weshall be latewell au revoir goodbye you hear herthen tomorrow you will speak to the emperorcertainly but about kutuzov i dont promisedo promise do promise vasili cried anna mikhaylovna as he wentwith the smile of a coquettish girl which at one time probably camenaturally to her but was now very illsuited to her careworn faceapparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed allthe old feminine arts but as soon as the prince had gone her faceresumed its former cold artificial expression she returned to thegroup where the vicomte was still talking and again pretended tolisten while waiting till it would be time to leave her task wasaccomplishedand what do you think of this latest comedy the coronation at milanasked anna pavlovna and of the comedy of the people of genoa and luccalaying their petitions before monsieur buonaparte and monsieurbuonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of thenations adorable it is enough to make ones head whirl it is as ifthe whole world had gone crazyprince andrew looked anna pavlovna straight in the face with a sarcasticsmiledieu me la donne gare a qui la touche  they say he was very finewhen he said that he remarked repeating the words in italian diomi lha dato guai a chi la tocchi god has given it to me let him who touches it bewarei hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass runover anna pavlovna continued the sovereigns will not be able toendure this man who is a menace to everythingthe sovereigns i do not speak of russia said the vicomte polite buthopeless the sovereigns madame what have they done for louis xviifor the queen or for madame elizabeth nothing and he became moreanimated and believe me they are reaping the reward of their betrayalof the bourbon cause the sovereigns why they are sending ambassadorsto compliment the usurperand sighing disdainfully he again changed his positionprince hippolyte who had been gazing at the vicomte for some timethrough his lorgnette suddenly turned completely round toward thelittle princess and having asked for a needle began tracing the condecoat of arms on the table he explained this to her with as much gravityas if she had asked him to do itbaton de gueules engrele de gueules dazurmaison conde said hethe princess listened smilingif buonaparte remains on the throne of france a year longer thevicomte continued with the air of a man who in a matter with which heis better acquainted than anyone else does not listen to others butfollows the current of his own thoughts things will have gone too farby intrigues violence exile and executions french societyi meangood french societywill have been forever destroyed and thenhe shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands pierre wished tomake a remark for the conversation interested him but anna pavlovnawho had him under observation interruptedthe emperor alexander said she with the melancholy which alwaysaccompanied any reference of hers to the imperial family has declaredthat he will leave it to the french people themselves to choose theirown form of government and i believe that once free from the usurperthe whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of itsrightful king she concluded trying to be amiable to the royalistemigrantthat is doubtful said prince andrew monsieur le vicomte quiterightly supposes that matters have already gone too far i think it willbe difficult to return to the old regimefrom what i have heard said pierre blushing and breaking into theconversation almost all the aristocracy has already gone over tobonapartes sideit is the buonapartists who say that replied the vicomte withoutlooking at pierre at the present time it is difficult to know the realstate of french public opinionbonaparte has said so remarked prince andrew with a sarcastic smileit was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming hisremarks at him though without looking at himi showed them the path to glory but they did not follow it princeandrew continued after a short silence again quoting napoleons wordsi opened my antechambers and they crowded in i do not know how farhe was justified in saying sonot in the least replied the vicomte after the murder of the duceven the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero if to somepeople he went on turning to anna pavlovna he ever was a heroafter the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and onehero less on earthbefore anna pavlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciationof the vicomtes epigram pierre again broke into the conversation andthough anna pavlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate shewas unable to stop himthe execution of the duc denghien declared monsieur pierre was apolitical necessity and it seems to me that napoleon showed greatnessof soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility ofthat deeddieu mon dieu muttered anna pavlovna in a terrified whisperwhat monsieur pierre do you consider that assassination showsgreatness of soul said the little princess smiling and drawing herwork nearer to heroh oh exclaimed several voicescapital said prince hippolyte in english and began slapping his kneewith the palm of his handthe vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders pierre looked solemnly at hisaudience over his spectacles and continuedi say so he continued desperately because the bourbons fled fromthe revolution leaving the people to anarchy and napoleon aloneunderstood the revolution and quelled it and so for the general goodhe could not stop short for the sake of one mans lifewont you come over to the other table suggested anna pavlovnabut pierre continued his speech without heeding herno cried he becoming more and more eager napoleon is great becausehe rose superior to the revolution suppressed its abuses preserved allthat was good in itequality of citizenship and freedom of speech andof the pressand only for that reason did he obtain poweryes if having obtained power without availing himself of it to commitmurder he had restored it to the rightful king i should have called hima great man remarked the vicomtehe could not do that the people only gave him power that he might ridthem of the bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man therevolution was a grand thing continued monsieur pierre betraying bythis desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and hiswish to express all that was in his mindwhat revolution and regicide a grand thing well after that butwont you come to this other table repeated anna pavlovnarousseaus contrat social said the vicomte with a tolerant smilei am not speaking of regicide i am speaking about ideasyes ideas of robbery murder and regicide again interjected anironical voicethose were extremes no doubt but they are not what is most importantwhat is important are the rights of man emancipation from prejudicesand equality of citizenship and all these ideas napoleon has retainedin full forceliberty and equality said the vicomte contemptuously as if at lastdeciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words werehighsounding words which have long been discredited who does not loveliberty and equality even our saviour preached liberty and equalityhave people since the revolution become happier on the contrary wewanted liberty but buonaparte has destroyed itprince andrew kept looking with an amused smile from pierre to thevicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess in the first moment ofpierres outburst anna pavlovna despite her social experience washorrorstruck but when she saw that pierres sacrilegious words had notexasperated the vicomte and had convinced herself that it wasimpossible to stop him she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte ina vigorous attack on the oratorbut my dear monsieur pierre said she how do you explain the factof a great man executing a ducor even an ordinary man whois innocentand untriedi should like said the vicomte to ask how monsieur explains theth brumaire was not that an imposture it was a swindle and not atall like the conduct of a great manand the prisoners he killed in africa that was horrible said thelittle princess shrugging her shouldershes a low fellow say what you will remarked prince hippolytepierre not knowing whom to answer looked at them all and smiled hissmile was unlike the halfsmile of other people when he smiled hisgrave even rather gloomy look was instantaneously replaced by anothera childlike kindly even rather silly look which seemed to askforgivenessthe vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that thisyoung jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested all weresilenthow do you expect him to answer you all at once said prince andrewbesides in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish betweenhis acts as a private person as a general and as an emperor so itseems to meyes yes of course pierre chimed in pleased at the arrival of thisreinforcementone must admit continued prince andrew that napoleon as a man wasgreat on the bridge of arcola and in the hospital at jaffa where hegave his hand to the plaguestricken but but there are other actswhich it is difficult to justifyprince andrew who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness ofpierres remarks rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time togosuddenly prince hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attendand asking them all to be seated begani was told a charming moscow story today and must treat you to itexcuse me vicomtei must tell it in russian or the point will belost and prince hippolyte began to tell his story in such russianas a frenchman would speak after spending about a year in russiaeveryone waited so emphatically and eagerly did he demand theirattention to his storythere is in moscow a lady une dame and she is very stingy she musthave two footmen behind her carriage and very big ones that was hertaste and she had a ladys maid also big she saidhere prince hippolyte paused evidently collecting his ideas withdifficultyshe said oh yes she said girl to the maid put on a liveryget up behind the carriage and come with me while i make some callshere prince hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before hisaudience which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator severalpersons among them the elderly lady and anna pavlovna did howeversmileshe went suddenly there was a great wind the girl lost her hat andher long hair came down here he could contain himself no longer andwent on between gasps of laughter and the whole world knewand so the anecdote ended though it was unintelligible why he had toldit or why it had to be told in russian still anna pavlovna and theothers appreciated prince hippolytes social tact in so agreeably endingpierres unpleasant and unamiable outburst after the anecdote theconversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last andnext balls about theatricals and who would meet whom and when andwherehaving thanked anna pavlovna for her charming soiree the guests beganto take their leavepierre was ungainly stout about the average height broad with hugered hands he did not know as the saying is how to enter a drawingroom and still less how to leave one that is how to say somethingparticularly agreeable before going away besides this he was absentminded when he rose to go he took up instead of his own the generalsthreecornered hat and held it pulling at the plume till the generalasked him to restore it all his absentmindedness and inability toenter a room and converse in it was however redeemed by his kindlysimple and modest expression anna pavlovna turned toward him and witha christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretionnodded and said i hope to see you again but i also hope you willchange your opinions my dear monsieur pierrewhen she said this he did not reply and only bowed but again everybodysaw his smile which said nothing unless perhaps opinions areopinions but you see what a capital goodnatured fellow i am andeveryone including anna pavlovna felt thisprince andrew had gone out into the hall and turning his shoulders tothe footman who was helping him on with his cloak listenedindifferently to his wifes chatter with prince hippolyte who had alsocome into the hall prince hippolyte stood close to the pretty pregnantprincess and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglassgo in annette or you will catch cold said the little princesstaking leave of anna pavlovna it is settled she added in a lowvoiceanna pavlovna had already managed to speak to lise about the match shecontemplated between anatole and the little princess sisterinlawi rely on you my dear said anna pavlovna also in a low tone writeto her and let me know how her father looks at the matter au revoirand she left the hallprince hippolyte approached the little princess and bending his faceclose to her began to whisper somethingtwo footmen the princess and his own stood holding a shawl and acloak waiting for the conversation to finish they listened to thefrench sentences which to them were meaningless with an air ofunderstanding but not wishing to appear to do so the princess as usualspoke smilingly and listened with a laughi am very glad i did not go to the ambassadors said prince hippolyteso dull it has been a delightful evening has it not delightfulthey say the ball will be very good replied the princess drawing upher downy little lip all the pretty women in society will be therenot all for you will not be there not all said prince hippolytesmiling joyfully and snatching the shawl from the footman whom he evenpushed aside he began wrapping it round the princess either fromawkwardness or intentionally no one could have said which after theshawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time asthough embracing herstill smiling she gracefully moved away turning and glancing at herhusband prince andrews eyes were closed so weary and sleepy did heseemare you ready he asked his wife looking past herprince hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak which in the latest fashionreached to his very heels and stumbling in it ran out into the porchfollowing the princess whom a footman was helping into the carriageprincesse au revoir cried he stumbling with his tongue as well aswith his feetthe princess picking up her dress was taking her seat in the darkcarriage her husband was adjusting his saber prince hippolyte underpretense of helping was in everyones wayallow me sir said prince andrew in russian in a cold disagreeabletone to prince hippolyte who was blocking his pathi am expecting you pierre said the same voice but gently andaffectionatelythe postilion started the carriage wheels rattled prince hippolytelaughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomtewhom he had promised to take homewell mon cher said the vicomte having seated himself besidehippolyte in the carriage your little princess is very nice very niceindeed quite french and he kissed the tips of his fingers hippolyteburst out laughingdo you know you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airscontinued the vicomte i pity the poor husband that little officer whogives himself the airs of a monarchhippolyte spluttered again and amid his laughter said and you weresaying that the russian ladies are not equal to the french one has toknow how to deal with thempierre reaching the house first went into prince andrews study like onequite at home and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa tookfrom the shelf the first book that came to his hand it was caesarscommentaries and resting on his elbow began reading it in the middlewhat have you done to mlle scherer she will be quite ill now saidprince andrew as he entered the study rubbing his small white handspierre turned his whole body making the sofa creak he lifted his eagerface to prince andrew smiled and waved his handthat abbe is very interesting but he does not see the thing in theright light in my opinion perpetual peace is possible buti do notknow how to express it not by a balance of political powerit was evident that prince andrew was not interested in such abstractconversationone cant everywhere say all one thinks mon cher well have you atlast decided on anything are you going to be a guardsman or adiplomatist asked prince andrew after a momentary silencepierre sat up on the sofa with his legs tucked under himreally i dont yet know i dont like either the one or the otherbut you must decide on something your father expects itpierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor andhad remained away till he was twenty when he returned to moscow hisfather dismissed the abbe and said to the young man now go topetersburg look round and choose your profession i will agree toanything here is a letter to prince vasili and here is money write tome all about it and i will help you in everything pierre had alreadybeen choosing a career for three months and had not decided onanything it was about this choice that prince andrew was speakingpierre rubbed his foreheadbut he must be a freemason said he referring to the abbe whom he hadmet that eveningthat is all nonsense prince andrew again interrupted him let ustalk business have you been to the horse guardsno i have not but this is what i have been thinking and wanted totell you there is a war now against napoleon if it were a war forfreedom i could understand it and should be the first to enter the armybut to help england and austria against the greatest man in the world isnot rightprince andrew only shrugged his shoulders at pierres childish words heput on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsensebut it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer thanthe one prince andrew gave to this naive questionif no one fought except on his own conviction there would be no warshe saidand that would be splendid said pierreprince andrew smiled ironicallyvery likely it would be splendid but it will never come aboutwell why are you going to the war asked pierrewhat for i dont know i must besides that i am going he pausedi am going because the life i am leading here does not suit methe rustle of a womans dress was heard in the next room prince andrewshook himself as if waking up and his face assumed the look it had hadin anna pavlovnas drawing room pierre removed his feet from the sofathe princess came in she had changed her gown for a house dress asfresh and elegant as the other prince andrew rose and politely placed achair for herhow is it she began as usual in french settling down briskly andfussily in the easy chair how is it annette never got married howstupid you men all are not to have married her excuse me for saying sobut you have no sense about women what an argumentative fellow you aremonsieur pierreand i am still arguing with your husband i cant understand why hewants to go to the war replied pierre addressing the princess withnone of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in theirintercourse with young womenthe princess started evidently pierres words touched her to the quickah that is just what i tell him said she i dont understand it idont in the least understand why men cant live without wars how is itthat we women dont want anything of the kind dont need it now youshall judge between us i always tell him here he is uncles aidedecamp a most brilliant position he is so well known so muchappreciated by everyone the other day at the apraksins i heard a ladyasking is that the famous prince andrew i did indeed she laughedhe is so well received everywhere he might easily become aidedecampto the emperor you know the emperor spoke to him most graciouslyannette and i were speaking of how to arrange it what do you thinkpierre looked at his friend and noticing that he did not like theconversation gave no replywhen are you starting he askedoh dont speak of his going dont i wont hear it spoken of saidthe princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spokento hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly illsuited tothe family circle of which pierre was almost a member today when iremembered that all these delightful associations must be broken offand then you know andre she looked significantly at her husbandim afraid im afraid she whispered and a shudder ran down herbackher husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besidespierre and himself was in the room and addressed her in a tone offrigid politenesswhat is it you are afraid of lise i dont understand said hethere what egotists men all are all all egotists just for a whim ofhis own goodness only knows why he leaves me and locks me up alone inthe countrywith my father and sister remember said prince andrew gentlyalone all the same without my friends and he expects me not to beafraidher tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up giving her not ajoyful but an animal squirrellike expression she paused as if shefelt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before pierre though thegist of the matter lay in thati still cant understand what you are afraid of said prince andrewslowly not taking his eyes off his wifethe princess blushed and raised her arms with a gesture of despairno andrew i must say you have changed oh how you haveyour doctor tells you to go to bed earlier said prince andrew youhad better gothe princess said nothing but suddenly her short downy lip quiveredprince andrew rose shrugged his shoulders and walked about the roompierre looked over his spectacles with naive surprise now at him andnow at her moved as if about to rise too but changed his mindwhy should i mind monsieur pierre being here exclaimed the littleprincess suddenly her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearfulgrimace i have long wanted to ask you andrew why you have changed soto me what have i done to you you are going to the war and have nopity for me why is itlise was all prince andrew said but that one word expressed anentreaty a threat and above all conviction that she would herselfregret her words but she went on hurriedlyyou treat me like an invalid or a child i see it all did you behavelike that six months agolise i beg you to desist said prince andrew still more emphaticallypierre who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened toall this rose and approached the princess he seemed unable to bear thesight of tears and was ready to cry himselfcalm yourself princess it seems so to you because i assure you imyself have experienced and so because no excuse me anoutsider is out of place here no dont distress yourself goodbyeprince andrew caught him by the handno wait pierre the princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of thepleasure of spending the evening with youno he thinks only of himself muttered the princess withoutrestraining her angry tearslise said prince andrew dryly raising his voice to the pitch whichindicates that patience is exhaustedsuddenly the angry squirrellike expression of the princess prettyface changed into a winning and piteous look of fear her beautiful eyesglanced askance at her husbands face and her own assumed the timiddeprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags itsdrooping tailmon dieu mon dieu she muttered and lifting her dress with one handshe went up to her husband and kissed him on the foreheadgood night lise said he rising and courteously kissing her hand ashe would have done to a strangerthe friends were silent neither cared to begin talking pierrecontinually glanced at prince andrew prince andrew rubbed his foreheadwith his small handlet us go and have supper he said with a sigh going to the doorthey entered the elegant newly decorated and luxurious dining roomeverything from the table napkins to the silver china and glass borethat imprint of newness found in the households of the newly marriedhalfway through supper prince andrew leaned his elbows on the table andwith a look of nervous agitation such as pierre had never before seen onhis face began to talkas one who has long had something on his mindand suddenly determines to speak outnever never marry my dear fellow thats my advice never marry tillyou can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of anduntil you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen herplainly as she is or else you will make a cruel and irrevocablemistake marry when you are old and good for nothingor all that isgood and noble in you will be lost it will all be wasted on triflesyes yes yes dont look at me with such surprise if you marryexpecting anything from yourself in the future you will feel at everystep that for you all is ended all is closed except the drawing roomwhere you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and anidiot but whats the good and he waved his armpierre took off his spectacles which made his face seem different andthe goodnatured expression still more apparent and gazed at his friendin amazementmy wife continued prince andrew is an excellent woman one of thoserare women with whom a mans honor is safe but o god what would i notgive now to be unmarried you are the first and only one to whom imention this because i like youas he said this prince andrew was less than ever like that bolkonski whohad lolled in anna pavlovnas easy chairs and with halfclosed eyes haduttered french phrases between his teeth every muscle of his thin facewas now quivering with nervous excitement his eyes in which the fireof life had seemed extinguished now flashed with brilliant light itwas evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times the moreimpassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritationyou dont understand why i say this he continued but it is thewhole story of life you talk of bonaparte and his career said hethough pierre had not mentioned bonaparte but bonaparte when heworked went step by step toward his goal he was free he had nothingbut his aim to consider and he reached it but tie yourself up with awoman and like a chained convict you lose all freedom and all youhave of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you withregret drawing rooms gossip balls vanity and trivialitythese arethe enchanted circle i cannot escape from i am now going to the warthe greatest war there ever was and i know nothing and am fit fornothing i am very amiable and have a caustic wit continued princeandrew and at anna pavlovnas they listen to me and that stupid setwithout whom my wife cannot exist and those women if you only knewwhat those society women are and women in general my father is rightselfish vain stupid trivial in everythingthats what women are whenyou see them in their true colors when you meet them in society itseems as if there were something in them but theres nothing nothingnothing no dont marry my dear fellow dont marry concluded princeandrewit seems funny to me said pierre that you you should consideryourself incapable and your life a spoiled life you have everythingbefore you everything and youhe did not finish his sentence but his tone showed how highly hethought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the futurehow can he talk like that thought pierre he considered his friend amodel of perfection because prince andrew possessed in the highestdegree just the very qualities pierre lacked and which might be bestdescribed as strength of will pierre was always astonished at princeandrews calm manner of treating everybody his extraordinary memoryhis extensive reading he had read everything knew everything and hadan opinion about everything but above all at his capacity for work andstudy and if pierre was often struck by andrews lack of capacity forphilosophical meditation to which he himself was particularlyaddicted he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign ofstrengtheven in the best most friendly and simplest relations of life praiseand commendation are essential just as grease is necessary to wheelsthat they may run smoothlymy part is played out said prince andrew whats the use of talkingabout me let us talk about you he added after a silence smiling athis reassuring thoughtsthat smile was immediately reflected on pierres facebut what is there to say about me said pierre his face relaxing intoa careless merry smile what am i an illegitimate son he suddenlyblushed crimson and it was plain that he had made a great effort to saythis without a name and without means and it really but he didnot say what it really was for the present i am free and am allright only i havent the least idea what i am to do i wanted toconsult you seriouslyprince andrew looked kindly at him yet his glancefriendly andaffectionate as it wasexpressed a sense of his own superiorityi am fond of you especially as you are the one live man among ourwhole set yes youre all right choose what you will its all thesame youll be all right anywhere but look here give up visitingthose kuragins and leading that sort of life it suits you so badlyallthis debauchery dissipation and the rest of itwhat would you have my dear fellow answered pierre shrugging hisshoulders women my dear fellow womeni dont understand it replied prince andrew women who are comme ilfaut thats a different matter but the kuragins set of women womenand wine i dont understandpierre was staying at prince vasili kuragins and sharing the dissipatedlife of his son anatole the son whom they were planning to reform bymarrying him to prince andrews sisterdo you know said pierre as if suddenly struck by a happy thoughtseriously i have long been thinking of it leading such a life icant decide or think properly about anything ones head aches and onespends all ones money he asked me for tonight but i wont goyou give me your word of honor not to goon my honorit was past one oclock when pierre left his friend it was a cloudlessnorthern summer night pierre took an open cab intending to drivestraight home but the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt theimpossibility of going to sleep on such a night it was light enough tosee a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning orevening than night on the way pierre remembered that anatole kuraginwas expecting the usual set for cards that evening after which therewas generally a drinking bout finishing with visits of a kind pierrewas very fond ofi should like to go to kuragins thought hebut he immediately recalled his promise to prince andrew not to gothere then as happens to people of weak character he desired sopassionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed tothat he decided to go the thought immediately occurred to him that hispromise to prince andrew was of no account because before he gave it hehad already promised prince anatole to come to his gathering besidesthought he all such words of honor are conventional things with nodefinite meaning especially if one considers that by tomorrow one maybe dead or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor anddishonor will be all the same pierre often indulged in reflections ofthis sort nullifying all his decisions and intentions he went tokuraginsreaching the large house near the horse guards barracks in whichanatole lived pierre entered the lighted porch ascended the stairsand went in at the open door there was no one in the anteroom emptybottles cloaks and overshoes were lying about there was a smell ofalcohol and sounds of voices and shouting in the distancecards and supper were over but the visitors had not yet dispersedpierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room in which were theremains of supper a footman thinking no one saw him was drinking onthe sly what was left in the glasses from the third room came sounds oflaughter the shouting of familiar voices the growling of a bear andgeneral commotion some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiouslyround an open window three others were romping with a young bear onepulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the othersi bet a hundred on stevens shouted onemind no holding on cried anotheri bet on dolokhov cried a third kuragin you part our handsthere leave bruin alone heres a bet onat one draught or he loses shouted a fourthjacob

cried he addressing pierreanother voice from a man of medium height with clear blue eyesparticularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ringcried from the window come here part the bets this was dolokhov anofficer of the semenov regiment a notorious gambler and duelist whowas living with anatole pierre smiled looking about him merrilyi dont understand whats it all aboutwait a bit he is not drunk yet a bottle here said anatole taking aglass from the table he went up to pierrefirst of all you must drinkpierre drank one glass after another looking from under his brows atthe tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window and listeningto their chatter anatole kept on refilling pierres glass whileexplaining that dolokhov was betting with stevens an english navalofficer that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledgeof the third floor window with his legs hanging outgo on you must drink it all said anatole giving pierre the lastglass or i wont let you gono i wont said pierre pushing anatole aside and he went up to thewindowdolokhov was holding the englishmans hand and clearly and distinctlyrepeating the terms of the bet addressing himself particularly toanatole and pierredolokhov was of medium height with curly hair and lightblue eyes hewas about twentyfive like all infantry officers he wore no mustacheso that his mouth the most striking feature of his face was clearlyseen the lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved the middleof the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firmlower one and something like two distinct smiles played continuallyround the two corners of the mouth this together with the resoluteinsolent intelligence of his eyes produced an effect which made itimpossible not to notice his face dolokhov was a man of small means andno connections yet though anatole spent tens of thousands of rublesdolokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing thatall who knew them including anatole himself respected him more thanthey did anatole dolokhov could play all games and nearly always wonhowever much he drank he never lost his clearheadedness both kuraginand dolokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegracesof petersburgthe bottle of rum was brought the window frame which prevented anyonefrom sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen whowere evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts ofthe gentlemen aroundanatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window he wanted tosmash something pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame butcould not move it he smashed a paneyou have a try hercules said he turning to pierrepierre seized the crossbeam tugged and wrenched the oak frame out witha crashtake it right out or theyll think im holding on said dolokhovis the englishman bragging eh is it all right said anatolefirstrate said pierre looking at dolokhov who with a bottle of rumin his hand was approaching the window from which the light of the skythe dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset was visibledolokhov the bottle of rum still in his hand jumped onto the windowsill listen cried he standing there and addressing those in theroom all were silenti bet fifty imperialshe spoke french that the englishman mightunderstand him but he did not speak it very welli bet fiftyimperials or do you wish to make it a hundred added he addressingthe englishmanno fifty replied the latterall right fifty imperials that i will drink a whole bottle of rumwithout taking it from my mouth sitting outside the window on thisspot he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the windowand without holding on to anything is that rightquite right said the englishmananatole turned to the englishman and taking him by one of the buttons ofhis coat and looking down at himthe englishman was shortbeganrepeating the terms of the wager to him in englishwait cried dolokhov hammering with the bottle on the window sill toattract attention wait a bit kuragin listen if anyone else does thesame i will pay him a hundred imperials do you understandthe englishman nodded but gave no indication whether he intended toaccept this challenge or not anatole did not release him and though hekept nodding to show that he understood anatole went on translatingdolokhovs words into english a thin young lad an hussar of the lifeguards who had been losing that evening climbed on the window sillleaned over and looked downoh oh oh he muttered looking down from the window at the stones ofthe pavementshut up cried dolokhov pushing him away from the window the ladjumped awkwardly back into the room tripping over his spursplacing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easilydolokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered hislegs pressing against both sides of the window he adjusted himself onhis seat lowered his hands moved a little to the right and then to theleft and took up the bottle anatole brought two candles and placedthem on the window sill though it was already quite light dolokhovsback in his white shirt and his curly head were lit up from bothsides everyone crowded to the window the englishman in front pierrestood smiling but silent one man older than the others presentsuddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seizehold of dolokhovs shirti say this is folly hell be killed said this more sensible mananatole stopped himdont touch him youll startle him and then hell be killed ehwhat then ehdolokhov turned round and again holding on with both hands arrangedhimself on his seatif anyone comes meddling again said he emitting the words separatelythrough his thin compressed lips i will throw him down there nowthensaying this he again turned round dropped his hands took the bottleand lifted it to his lips threw back his head and raised his free handto balance himself one of the footmen who had stooped to pick up somebroken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from thewindow and from dolokhovs back anatole stood erect with staring eyesthe englishman looked on sideways pursing up his lips the man who hadwished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himselfon a sofa with his face to the wall pierre hid his face from which afaint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror andfear all were still pierre took his hands from his eyes dolokhovstill sat in the same position only his head was thrown further backtill his curly hair touched his shirt collar and the hand holding thebottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort thebottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his headtilting yet further back why is it so long thought pierre it seemedto him that more than half an hour had elapsed suddenly dolokhov made abackward movement with his spine and his arm trembled nervously thiswas sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the slopingledge as he began slipping down his head and arm wavered still morewith the strain one hand moved as if to clutch the window sill butrefrained from touching it pierre again covered his eyes and thought hewould never open them again suddenly he was aware of a stir all aroundhe looked up dolokhov was standing on the window sill with a pale butradiant faceits emptyhe threw the bottle to the englishman who caught it neatly dolokhovjumped down he smelt strongly of rumwell done fine fellow theres a bet for you

get round him listen ill take your bet tomorrow but now weare all going to scome on then cried pierre come on and well take bruin withusand he caught the bear took it in his arms lifted it from the groundand began dancing round the room with itprince vasili kept the promise he had given to princess drubetskaya whohad spoken to him on behalf of her only son boris on the evening of annapavlovnas

waved his arms to impersonate the policeman his portly formagain shook with a deep ringing laugh the laugh of one who always eatswell and in particular drinks well so do come and dine with us hesaidsilence ensued the countess looked at her callers smiling affably butnot concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they nowrose and took their leave the visitors daughter was already smoothingdown her dress with an inquiring look at her mother when suddenly fromthe next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to thedoor and the noise of a chair falling over and a girl of thirteenhiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock darted in andstopped short in the middle of the room it was evident that she had notintended her flight to bring her so far behind her in the doorwayappeared a student with a crimson coat collar an officer of the guardsa girl of fifteen and a plump rosyfaced boy in a short jacketthe count jumped up and swaying from

doll which she produced from thefolds of her frockdo you see my doll mimi you see was all natasha managedto utter to her everything seemed funny she leaned against her motherand burst into such a loud ringing fit of laughter that even the primvisitor could not help joining innow then go away and take your monstrosity with you said the motherpushing away her daughter with pretended sternness and turning to thevisitor she added she is my youngest girlnatasha raising her face for a moment from her mothers mantillaglanced up at her through tears of laughter and again hid her facethe visitor compelled to look on at this family scene thought itnecessary to take some part in ittell me my dear said she to natasha is mimi a relation of yours adaughter i supposenatasha did not like the

excitement and mirth thatshone in all their faces evidently in the back rooms from which theyhad dashed out so impetuously the conversation had been more amusingthan the drawingroom talk of society scandals the weather andcountess apraksina now and then they glanced at one another hardlyable to suppress their laughterthe two young men the student and the officer friends from childhoodwere of the same age and both handsome fellows though not alike boriswas tall and fair and his calm and handsome face had regular delicatefeatures nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expressiondark hairs were already showing on his upper lip and his whole faceexpressed impetuosity and enthusiasm nicholas blushed when he enteredthe drawing room he evidently tried to find something to say butfailed boris on the contrary at once found his footing and relatedquietly and humorously how he had known that doll mimi when she wasstill quite a young lady before her nose was broken how she had agedduring the five years he had known her and how her head had crackedright across the skull having said this he glanced at natasha sheturned away from him and glanced at her younger brother who wasscrewing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter and unable tocontrol herself any longer she jumped up and rushed from the room asfast as her nimble little feet would carry her boris did not laughyou were meaning to go out werent you mamma do you want thecarriage he asked his mother with a smileyes yes go and tell them to get it ready she answered returninghis smileboris quietly left the room and went in search of natasha the plump boyran after them angrily as if vexed that their program had beendisturbedthe only young people remaining in the drawing room not counting theyoung lady visitor and the countess eldest daughter who was four yearsolder than her sister and behaved already like a grownup person werenicholas and sonya the niece sonya was a slender little brunette witha tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes thick blackplaits coiling twice round her head and a tawny tint in her complexionand especially in the color of her slender but graceful and musculararms and neck by the grace of her movements by the softness andflexibility of her small limbs and by a certain coyness and reserve ofmanner she reminded one of a pretty halfgrown kitten which promisesto become a beautiful little cat she evidently considered it proper toshow an interest in the general conversation by smiling but in spite ofherself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin whowas going to join the army with such passionate girlish adoration thather smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone and it wasclear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with moreenergy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could likenatasha and boris escape from the drawing roomah yes my dear said the count addressing the visitor and pointingto nicholas his friend boris has become an officer and so forfriendships sake he is leaving the university and me his old fatherand entering the military service my dear and there

vocationhe glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor and they were bothregarding him with a smile of approbationschubert the colonel of the pavlograd hussars is dining with ustoday he has been here on leave and is taking nicholas back with himit cant be helped said the count shrugging his shoulders andspeaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed himi have already told you papa said his son that if you dont wishto let me go ill stay but i know i am no use anywhere except in thearmy i am not a diplomat or a government clerki dont know how tohide what i feel as he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousnessof a handsome youth at sonya and the young lady visitorthe little kitten feasting her eyes on him seemed ready at any momentto start her gambols again and display her kittenish natureall right all right said the old count he always flares up thisbuonaparte has turned all their heads they all think of how he rosefrom an ensign and became emperor well well god grant it he addednot noticing his visitors sarcastic smilethe elders began talking about bonaparte julie karagina turned to youngrostovwhat a pity you werent at the arkharovs on thursday it was so dullwithout you said she giving him a tender smilethe young man flattered sat down nearer to her with a coquettishsmile and engaged the smiling julie in a confidential conversationwithout at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heartof sonya who blushed and smiled unnaturally in the midst of his talkhe glanced round at her she gave him a passionately angry glance andhardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile onher lips she got up and left the room all nicholas animationvanished he waited for the first pause in the conversation and thenwith a distressed face left the room to find sonyahow plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleevessaid anna mikhaylovna pointing to nicholas as he went out cousinagedangereux voisinage  she added cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhoodyes said the countess when the brightness these young people hadbrought into the room had vanished and as if answering a question noone had put but which was always in her mind and how much sufferinghow much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in themnow and yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy one isalways always anxious especially just at this age so dangerous bothfor girls and boysit all depends on the bringing up remarked the visitoryes youre quite right continued the countess till now i havealways thank god been my childrens friend and had their fullconfidence said she repeating the mistake of so many parents whoimagine that their children have no secrets from them i know i shallalways be my daughters first confidante and that if nicholas with hisimpulsive nature does get into mischief a boy cant help it he willall the same never be like those petersburg young menyes they are splendid splendid youngsters chimed in the count whoalways solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding thateverything was splendid just fancy wants to be an hussar whats oneto do my dearwhat a charming creature your younger girl is said the visitor alittle volcanoyes a regular volcano said the count takes after me and what avoice she has though shes my daughter i tell the truth when i

count why our mothers usedto be married at twelve or thirteenand shes in love with boris already just fancy said the countesswith a gentle smile looking at boris and went on evidently concernedwith a thought that always occupied her now you see if i were to besevere with her and to forbid it goodness knows what they might be upto on the sly she meant that they would be kissing but as it is iknow every word she utters she will come running to me of her ownaccord in the evening and tell me everything perhaps i spoil her butreally that seems the best plan with her elder sister i was stricteryes i was brought up quite differently remarked the handsome elderdaughter countess vera with a smilebut the smile did not enhance veras beauty as smiles generally do onthe contrary it gave her an unnatural and therefore unpleasantexpression vera was goodlooking not at all stupid quick at learningwas wellbrought up and had a pleasant voice what she said was trueand appropriate yet strange to say everyonethe visitors andcountess aliketurned to look at her as if wondering why she had saidit and they all felt awkwardpeople are always too clever with their eldest children and try to makesomething exceptional of them said the visitorwhats the good of denying it my dear our dear countess was tooclever with vera said the count well what of that shes turned outsplendidly all the same he added winking at verathe guests got up and took their leave promising to return to dinnerwhat manners i thought they would never go said the countess whenshe had seen her guests outwhen natasha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as theconservatory there she paused and stood listening to the conversationin the drawing room waiting for boris to come out she was alreadygrowing impatient and stamped her foot ready to cry at his not comingat once when she heard the young mans discreet steps approachingneither quickly nor slowly at this natasha dashed swiftly among theflower tubs and hid thereboris paused in the middle of the room looked round brushed a littledust from the sleeve of his uniform and going up to a mirror examinedhis handsome face natasha very still peered out from her ambushwaiting to see what he would do he stood a little while before theglass smiled and walked toward the other door natasha was about tocall him but changed her mind let him look for me thought shehardly had boris gone than sonya flushed in tears and mutteringangrily came in at the other door natasha checked her first impulse torun out to her and remained in her hiding place watchingas under aninvisible capto see what went on in the world she was experiencing anew and peculiar pleasure sonya muttering to herself kept lookinground toward the drawingroom door it opened and nicholas came insonya what is the matter with you how can you said he running upto herits nothing nothing leave me alone sobbed sonyaah i know what it iswell if you do so much the better and you can go back to hersooonya look here how can you torture me and yourself like thatfor a mere fancy said nicholas taking her handsonya did not pull it away and left off crying natasha not stirringand

under her brows smiling and almost crying fromexcitementboris blushedhow funny you are he said bending down to her and blushing stillmore but he waited and did nothingsuddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he embraced him sothat both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck and tossingback her hair kissed him full on the lipsthen she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubsand stood hanging her headnatasha he said you know that i love you butyou are in love with me natasha broke inyes i am but please dont let us do like that in another fouryears

dipping his penyou always manage to do things at the wrong time continued vera youcame rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed ofyouthough what she said was quite just perhaps for

shall go in to see thecount my uncle but you my dear had better go to pierre meanwhile anddont forget to give him the rostovs invitation they ask him todinner i suppose he wont go she continued turning to the princeon the contrary replied the prince who had plainly become depressedi shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man herehe is and the count has not once asked for himhe shrugged his shoulders a footman conducted boris down one flight ofstairs and up another to pierres roomspierre after all had not managed to choose a career for himself inpetersburg and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct andsent to moscow the story told about him at count rostovs was truepierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear he had now beenfor some days in moscow and was staying as usual at his fathers housethough he expected that the story of his escapade would be already knownin moscow and that the ladies about his fatherwho were never favorablydisposed toward himwould have used it to turn the count against himhe nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his fathers part ofthe house entering the drawing room where the princesses spent most oftheir time he greeted the ladies two of whom were sitting atembroidery frames while a third read aloud it was the eldest who wasreadingthe one who had met anna mikhaylovna the two younger ones wereembroidering both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in thatone had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier pierrewas received as if he were a corpse or a leper the eldest princesspaused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyesthe second assumed precisely the same expression while the youngestthe one with the mole who was of a cheerful and lively dispositionbent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing sceneshe foresaw she drew her wool down through the canvas and scarcelyable to refrain from laughing stooped as if trying to make out thepatternhow do you do cousin said pierre you dont recognize mei recognize you only too well too wellhow is the count can i see him asked pierre awkwardly as usual butunabashedthe count is suffering physically and mentally and apparently you havedone your best to increase his mental sufferingscan i see the count pierre again askedhm if you wish to kill him to kill him outright you can seehim olga go and see whether uncles beef tea is readyit is almosttime she added giving pierre to understand that they were busy andbusy making his father comfortable while evidently he pierre was onlybusy causing him annoyanceolga went out pierre stood looking at the sisters then he bowed andsaid then i will go to my rooms you will let me know when i can seehimand he left the room followed by the low but ringing laughter of thesister with the molenext day prince vasili had arrived and settled in the counts house hesent for pierre and said to him my dear fellow if you are going tobehave here as you did in petersburg you will end very badly that isall i have to say to you the count is very very ill and you must notsee him at allsince then pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time inhis rooms upstairswhen boris appeared at his door pierre was pacing up and down his roomstopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wallas if running a sword through an invisible foe and glaring savagelyover his spectacles and then again resuming his walk mutteringindistinct words shrugging his shoulders and gesticulatingengland is done for said he scowling and pointing his finger atsomeone unseen mr pitt as a traitor to the nation and to the rightsof man is sentenced to but before pierrewho at that momentimagined himself to be napoleon in person and to have just effected thedangerous crossing of the straits of dover and captured londoncouldpronounce pitts sentence he saw a wellbuilt and handsome youngofficer entering his room pierre paused he had left moscow when boriswas a boy of fourteen and had quite forgotten him but in his usualimpulsive and hearty way he took boris by the hand with a friendlysmiledo you remember me asked boris quietly with a pleasant smile i havecome with my mother to see the count but it seems he is not wellyes it seems he is ill people are always disturbing him answeredpierre trying to remember who this young man wasboris felt that pierre did not recognize him but did not consider itnecessary to introduce himself and without experiencing the leastembarrassment looked pierre straight in the facecount rostov asks you to come to dinner today said he after aconsiderable pause which made pierre feel uncomfortableah count rostov exclaimed pierre joyfully then you are his sonilya only fancy i didnt know you at first do you remember how wewent to the sparrow hills with madame jacquot its such an ageyou are mistaken said boris deliberately with a bold and slightlysarcastic smile i am boris son of princess anna mikhaylovnadrubetskaya rostov the father is ilya and his son is nicholas inever knew any madame jacquotpierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or beesoh dear what am i thinking about ive mixed everything up one has somany relatives in moscow so you are boris of course well now we knowwhere we are and what do you think of the boulogne expedition theenglish will come off badly you know if napoleon gets across thechannel i think the expedition is quite feasible if only villeneuvedoesnt make a mess of thingsboris knew nothing about the boulogne expedition he did not read thepapers and it was the first time he had heard villeneuves namewe here in moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandalthan with politics said he in his quiet ironical tone i know nothingabout it and have not thought about it moscow is chiefly busy withgossip he continued just now they are talking about you and yourfatherpierre smiled in his goodnatured way as if afraid for his companionssake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret butboris spoke distinctly clearly and dryly looking straight intopierres eyesmoscow has nothing else to do but gossip boris went on everybody iswondering to whom the count will leave his fortune though he mayperhaps outlive us all as i sincerely hope he willyes it is all very horrid interrupted pierre very horridpierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently saysomething disconcerting to himselfand it must seem to you said boris flushing slightly but notchanging his tone or attitude it must seem to you that everyone istrying to get something out of the rich manso it does thought pierrebut i just wish to say to avoid misunderstandings that you are quitemistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people we are verypoor but for my own part at any rate for the very reason that yourfather is rich i dont regard myself as a relation of his and neitheri nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from himfor a long time pierre could not understand but when he did he jumpedup from the sofa seized boris under the elbow in his quick clumsy wayand blushing far more than boris began to speak with a feeling ofmingled shame and vexationwell this is strange do you suppose i who could think i knowvery wellbut boris again interrupted himi am glad i have spoken out fully perhaps you did not like it youmust excuse me said he putting pierre at ease instead of being put atease by him but i hope i have not offended you i always make it arule to speak out well what answer am i to take will you come todinner at the rostovsand boris having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty andextricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in itbecame quite pleasant againno but i say said pierre calming down you are a wonderful fellowwhat you have just said is good very good of course you dont know mewe have not met for such a long time not since we were children youmight think that i i understand quite understand i could not havedone it myself i should not have had the courage but its splendid iam very glad to have made your acquaintance its queer he added aftera pause that you should have suspected me he began to laugh wellwhat of it i hope well get better acquainted and he pressed borishand do you know i have not once been in to see the count he has notsent for me i am sorry for him as a man but what can one doand so you think napoleon will manage to get an army across askedboris with a smilepierre saw that boris wished to change the subject and being of thesame mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of theboulogne expeditiona footman came in to summon boristhe princess was going pierre inorder to make boris better acquaintance promised to come to dinnerand warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectaclesinto boris eyes after he had gone pierre continued pacing up and downthe room for a long time no longer piercing an imaginary foe with hisimaginary sword but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasantintelligent and resolute young manas often happens in early youth especially to one who leads a lonelylife he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made uphis mind that they would be friendsprince vasili saw the princess off she held a handkerchief to her eyesand her face was tearfulit is dreadful dreadful she was saying but cost me what it may ishall do my duty i will come and spend the night he must not be leftlike this every moment is precious i cant think why

on her thin dignified elderly face andshe took the money from under the handkerchiefanna mikhaylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be readyto embrace the countess at the appropriate momentthis is for boris from me for his outfitanna mikhaylovna was already embracing her and weeping the countesswept too they wept because they were friends and because they werekindhearted and because theyfriends from childhoodhad to thinkabout such a base thing as money and because their youth was overbut those tears were pleasant to them bothcountess rostova with her daughters and a large number of guests wasalready seated in the drawing room the count took the gentlemen intohis study and showed them his choice collection of turkish pipes fromtime to time he went out to ask hasnt she come yet they wereexpecting marya dmitrievna akhrosimova known in society as le terribledragon a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank but for commonsense and frank plainness of speech marya dmitrievna was known to theimperial family as well as to all moscow and petersburg and both citieswondered at her laughed privately at her rudenesses and told goodstories about her while none the less all without exception respectedand feared herin the counts room which was full of tobacco smoke they talked of warthat had been announced in a manifesto and about the recruiting noneof them had yet seen the manifesto but they all knew it had appearedthe count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking andtalking he neither smoked nor talked but bending his head first to oneside and then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure andlistened to the conversation of his two neighbors whom he egged onagainst each otherone of them was a sallow cleanshaven civilian with a thin and wrinkledface already growing old though he was dressed like a most fashionableyoung man he sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home andhaving stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth was inhaling thesmoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes this was an old bachelorshinshin a cousin of the countess a man with a sharp tongue as theysaid in moscow society he seemed to be condescending to his companionthe latter a fresh rosy officer of the guards irreproachably washedbrushed and buttoned held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and withred lips gently inhaled the smoke letting it escape from his handsomemouth in rings this was lieutenant berg an officer in the semenovregiment with whom boris was to travel to join the army and about whomnatasha had teased her elder sister vera speaking of berg as herintended the count sat between them and listened attentively hisfavorite occupation when not playing boston a card game he was veryfond of was that of listener especially when he succeeded in settingtwo loquacious talkers at one anotherwell then old chap mon tres honorable alphonse karlovich saidshinshin laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary russianexpressions with the choicest french phraseswhich was a peculiarity ofhis speech vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur letat  you wantto make something out of your company you expect to make an income out of the governmentno peter nikolaevich i only want to show that in the cavalry theadvantages are far less than in the infantry just consider my ownposition now peter nikolaevichberg always spoke quietly politely and with great precision hisconversation always related entirely to himself he would remain calmand silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearingon himself he could remain silent for hours without being at all putout of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable but as soonas the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talkcircumstantially and with evident satisfactionconsider my position peter nikolaevich were i in the cavalry i shouldget not more than two hundred rubles every four months even with therank of lieutenant but as it is i receive two hundred and thirty saidhe looking at shinshin and the count with a joyful pleasant smile asif it were obvious to him that his success must always be the chiefdesire of everyone elsebesides that peter nikolaevich by exchanging into the guards i shallbe in a more prominent position continued berg and vacancies occurmuch more frequently in the foot guards then just think what can bedone with two hundred and thirty rubles i even manage to put a littleaside and to send something to my father he went on emitting a smokeringla balance y est  a german knows how to skin a flint as theproverb says remarked shinshin moving his pipe to the other side ofhis mouth and winking at the count so that squares mattersthe count burst out laughing the other guests seeing that shinshin wastalking came up to listen berg oblivious of irony or indifferencecontinued to explain how by exchanging into the guards he had alreadygained a step on his old comrades of the cadet corps how in wartime thecompany commander might get killed and he as senior in the companymight easily succeed to the post how popular he was with everyone inthe regiment and how satisfied his father was with him berg evidentlyenjoyed narrating all this and did not seem to suspect that otherstoo might have their own interests but all he said was so prettilysedate and the naivete of his youthful egotism was so obvious that hedisarmed his hearerswell my boy youll get along wherever you gofoot or horsethatill warrant said shinshin patting him on the shoulder and taking hisfeet off the sofaberg smiled joyously the count by his guests went into the drawingroomit was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guestsexpecting the summons to zakuska  avoid engaging in any longconversation but think it necessary to move about and talk in order toshow that they are not at all impatient for their food the host andhostess look toward the door and now and then glance at one anotherand the visitors try to guess from these glances who or what they arewaiting forsome important relation who has not yet arrived or a dishthat is not yet ready hors doeuvrespierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in themiddle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come acrossblocking the way for everyone the countess tried to make him talk buthe went on naively looking around through his spectacles as if in searchof somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables he was inthe way and was the only one who did not notice the fact most of theguests knowing of the affair with the bear looked with curiosity atthis big stout quiet man wondering how such a clumsy modest fellowcould have played such a prank on a policemanyou have only lately arrived the countess asked himoui madame replied he looking around himyou have not yet seen my husbandnon madame he smiled quite inappropriatelyyou have been in paris recently i believe i suppose its veryinterestingvery interestingthe countess exchanged glances with anna mikhaylovna the latterunderstood that she was being asked to entertain this young man andsitting down beside him she began to speak about his father but heanswered her as he had the countess only in monosyllables the otherguests were all conversing with one another the razumovskis it wascharming you

dmitrievnaentered the roomall the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the veryoldest rose marya dmitrievna paused at the door tall and stoutholding high her fiftyyearold head with its gray curls she stoodsurveying the guests and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as ifrolling them up marya dmitrievna always spoke in russianhealth and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to herchildren she said in her loud fulltoned voice which drowned allothers well you old sinner she went on turning to the count whowas kissing her hand youre feeling dull in moscow i daresay nowhereto hunt with your dogs but what is to be done old man just see howthese nestlings are growing up and she pointed to the girls you mustlook for husbands for them whether you like it or notwell said she hows my cossack marya dmitrievna always callednatasha a cossack and she stroked the childs arm as she came upfearless and gay to kiss her hand i know shes a scamp of a girl buti like hershe took a pair of pearshaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule andhaving given them to the rosy natasha who beamed with the pleasure ofher saintsday fete turned away at once and addressed herself topierreeh eh friend come here a bit said she assuming a soft high toneof voice come here my friend and she ominously tucked up hersleeves still higher pierre approached looking at her in a childlikeway through his spectaclescome nearer come nearer friend i used to be the only one to tellyour father the truth when he was in favor and in your case its myevident duty she paused all were silent expectant of what was tofollow for this was clearly only a preludea fine lad my word a fine lad his father lies on his deathbed andhe amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear for shame sirfor shame it would be better if you went to the warshe turned away and gave her hand to the count who could hardly keepfrom laughingwell i suppose it is time we were at table said marya dmitrievnathe count went in first with marya dmitrievna the countess followed onthe arm of a colonel of hussars a man of importance to them becausenicholas was to go with him to the regiment then came anna mikhaylovnawith shinshin berg gave his arm to vera the smiling julie karaginawent in with nicholas after them other couples followed filling thewhole dining hall and last of all the children tutors and governessesfollowed singly the footmen began moving about chairs scraped theband struck up in the gallery and the guests settled down in theirplaces then the strains of the counts household band were replaced bythe clatter of knives and forks the voices of visitors and the softsteps of the footmen at one end of the table sat the countess withmarya dmitrievna on her right and anna mikhaylovna on her left theother lady visitors were farther down at the other end sat the countwith the hussar colonel on his left and shinshin and the other malevisitors on his right midway down the long table on one side sat thegrownup young people vera beside berg and pierre beside boris and onthe other side the children tutors and governesses from behind thecrystal decanters and fruit vases the count kept glancing at his wifeand her tall cap with its lightblue ribbons and busily filled hisneighbors glasses not neglecting his own the countess in turnwithout omitting her duties as hostess threw significant glances frombehind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed bytheir redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair at theladies end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time at themens end the voices sounded louder and louder especially that of thecolonel of hussars who growing more and more flushed ate and drank somuch that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests bergwith tender smiles was saying to vera that love is not an earthly but aheavenly feeling boris was telling his new friend pierre who the guestswere and exchanging glances with natasha who was sitting oppositepierre spoke little but examined the new faces and ate a great deal ofthe two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to thegame without omitting a single dish or one of the wines these latterthe butler thrust mysteriously forward wrapped in a napkin from behindthe next mans shoulders and whispered dry madeira hungarianor rhine wine as the case might be of the four crystal glassesengraved with the counts monogram that stood before his plate pierreheld out one at random and drank with enjoyment gazing with everincreasing amiability at the other guests natasha who sat oppositewas looking at boris as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are inlove with and have just kissed for the first time sometimes that samelook fell on pierre and that funny lively little girls look made himinclined to laugh without knowing whynicholas sat at some distance from sonya beside julie karagina to whomhe was again talking with the same involuntary smile sonya wore acompany smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy now she turnedpale now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what nicholas andjulie were saying to one another the governess kept looking rounduneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon thechildren the german tutor was trying to remember all the dishes winesand kinds of dessert in order to send a full description of the dinnerto his people in germany and he felt greatly offended when the butlerwith a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by he frowned trying toappear as if he did not want any of that wine but was mortified becauseno one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or fromgreediness that he wanted it but simply from a conscientious desire forknowledgeat the mens end of the table the talk grew more and more animated thecolonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared inpetersburg and that a copy which he had himself seen had that day beenforwarded by courier to the commanderinchiefand why the deuce are we going to fight bonaparte remarked shinshinhe has stopped austrias cackle and i fear it will be our turn

germanaccent for the reasson zat ze emperor knows zat he declares in zemanifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger vreateningrussia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze empire as vell as

opening words of the manifesto and the wish which constitutes the emperors sole and absolute aimto establish peace in europe on firm foundationshas now decided himto despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition forthe attainment of that purposezat my dear sir is vy he concluded drinking a tumbler of winewith dignity and looking to the count for approvalconnaissezvous le proverbe  jerome jerome do not roam but turnspindles at home said shinshin puckering his brows and smilingcela nous convient a merveille suvorov nowhe knew what he wasabout yet they beat him a plate couture

added addressing nicholas who when he heard that thewar was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes and earsintent on the coloneli am quite of your opinion replied nicholas flaming up turning hisplate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision anddesperation as though he were at that moment facing some great dangeri am convinced that we russians must die or conquer he concludedconsciousas were othersafter the words were uttered that his remarkswere too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were thereforeawkwardwhat you said just now was splendid

approvinglythats fine said hethe young mans a real hussar shouted the colonel again thumping thetablewhat are you making such a noise about over there marya dmitrievnasdeep voice suddenly inquired

had been told that there would bepineapple ice before the ices champagne was served round the bandagain struck up the count and countess kissed and the guests leavingtheir seats went up to congratulate the countess and reached acrossthe table to clink glasses with the count with the children and withone another again the footmen rushed about chairs scraped and in thesame order in which they had entered but with redder faces the guestsreturned to the drawing room and to the counts studythe card tables were drawn out sets made up for boston and the countsvisitors settled themselves some in the two drawing rooms some in thesitting room some in the librarythe count holding his cards fanwise kept himself with difficulty fromdropping into his usual afterdinner nap and laughed at everything theyoung people at the countess instigation gathered round theclavichord and harp julie by general request played first after shehad played a little air with variations on the harp she joined theother young ladies in begging natasha and nicholas who were noted fortheir musical talent to sing something natasha who was treated asthough she were grown up was evidently very proud of this but at thesame time felt shywhat shall we sing she saidthe brook suggested nicholaswell then lets be quick boris come here said natasha but whereis sonyashe looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran tolook for herrunning into sonyas room and not finding her there natasha ran to thenursery but sonya was not there either natasha concluded that she mustbe on the chest in the passage the chest in the passage was the placeof mourning for the younger female generation in the rostov householdand there in fact was sonya lying face downward on nurses dirty featherbed on the top of the chest crumpling her gauzy pink dress under herhiding her face with her slender fingers and sobbing so convulsivelythat her bare little shoulders shook natashas face which had been soradiantly happy all that saints day suddenly changed her eyes becamefixed and then a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners ofher mouth droopedsonya what is it what is the matter oo oo oo andnatashas large mouth widened making her look quite ugly and she beganto wail like a baby without knowing why except that sonya was cryingsonya tried to lift her head to answer but could not and hid her facestill deeper in the bed natasha wept sitting on the bluestripedfeather bed and hugging her friend with an effort sonya sat up andbegan wiping her eyes and explainingnicholas is going away in a weeks time his papers have comehe told me himself but still i should not cry and she showed apaper she held in her handwith the verses nicholas had writtenstill i should not cry but you cant no one

galleryaddressing the first violinsemen do you know the daniel cooperthis was the counts favorite dance which he had danced in his youthstrictly speaking daniel cooper was one figure of the anglaiselook at papa shouted natasha to the whole company and quiteforgetting that she was dancing with a grownup partner she bent hercurly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughterand indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at thejovial old gentleman who standing beside his tall and stout partnermarya dmitrievna curved his arms beat time

waved and shouted tothe musicians to play faster faster faster and faster lightly morelightly and yet more lightly whirled the count flying round maryadmitrievna now on his toes now on his heels until turning hispartner round to her seat he executed the final pas raising his softfoot backwards bowing his perspiring head smiling and making a widesweep with his arm amid a thunder of applause and laughter led bynatasha both partners stood still breathing heavily and wiping theirfaces with their cambric handkerchiefsthats how we used to dance in our time ma chere said the countthat was a daniel

whenever a carriage drove up waited inexpectation of an important order for an expensive funeral the militarygovernor of moscow who had been assiduous in sending aidesdecamp toinquire after the counts health came himself that evening to bid alast farewell to the celebrated grandee of catherines court countbezukhovthe magnificent reception room was crowded everyone stood uprespectfully when the military governor having stayed about half anhour alone with the dying man passed out slightly acknowledging theirbows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixedon him by the doctors clergy and relatives of the family princevasili who had grown thinner and paler during the last few daysescorted him to the door repeating something to him several times inlow toneswhen the military governor had gone prince vasili sat down all alone ona chair in the ballroom crossing one leg high over the other leaninghis elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand after sittingso for a while he rose and looking about him with frightened eyeswent with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading to theback of the house to the room of the eldest princessthose who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervouswhispers and whenever anyone went into or came from the dying mansroom grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy athis door which creaked slightly when openedthe limits of human life are fixed and may not be oerpassed saidan old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and waslistening naively to his wordsi wonder is it not too late to administer unction asked the ladyadding the priests clerical title as if she had no opinion of her ownon the subjectah madam it is a great sacrament replied the priest passing hishand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his baldheadwho was that the military governor himself was being asked at theother side of the room how younglooking he isyes and he is over sixty i hear the count no longer recognizesanyone they wished to administer the sacrament of unctioni knew someone who received that sacrament seven timesthe second princess had just

pursing up his lips waved a severely negative finger beforehis nosetonight not later said he in a low voice and he moved away with adecorous smile of selfsatisfaction at being able clearly to understandand state the patients conditionmeanwhile prince vasili had opened the door into the princess roomin this room it was almost dark only two tiny lamps were burning beforethe icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastillesthe room was crowded with small pieces of furniture whatnotscupboards and little tables the quilt of a high white feather bed wasjust visible behind a screen a small dog began to barkah is it you cousinshe rose and smoothed her hair which was as usual so extremely smooththat it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered withvarnishhas anything happened she asked i am so terrifiedno there is no change i only came to have a talk about businesscatiche  muttered the prince seating himself wearily on the chairshe had just vacated you have made the place warm i must say heremarked well sit down lets have a talkcatherinei thought perhaps something had happened she said with her unchangingstonily severe expression and sitting down opposite the prince sheprepared to listeni wished to get a nap mon cousin but i cantwell my dear said prince vasili taking her hand and bending itdownwards as was his habitit was plain that this well referred to much that they bothunderstood without namingthe princess who had a straight rigid body abnormally long for herlegs looked directly at prince vasili with no sign of emotion in herprominent gray eyes then she shook her head and glanced up at the iconswith a sigh this might have been taken as an expression of sorrow anddevotion or of weariness and hope of resting before long prince vasiliunderstood it as an expression of wearinessand i he said do you think it is easier for me i am as worn out asa post horse but still i must have a talk with you catiche a veryserious talkprince vasili said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously nowon one side now on the other giving his face an unpleasant expressionwhich was never to be seen on it in a drawing room his eyes too seemedstrange at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the nextglanced round in alarmthe princess holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bonyhands looked attentively into prince vasilis eyes evidently resolvednot to be the first to break silence if she had to wait till morningwell you see my dear princess and cousin catherine semenovnacontinued prince vasili returning to his theme apparently not withoutan inner struggle at such a moment as this one must think ofeverything one must think of the future of all of you i love youall like children of my own as you knowthe princess continued to look at him without moving and with the samedull expressionand then of course my family has also to be considered prince vasiliwent on testily pushing away a little table without looking at heryou know catiche that weyou three sisters mamontov and my wifeare the counts only direct heirs i know i know how hard it is for youto talk or think of such matters it is no easier for me but my deari am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything do you knowi have sent for pierre the count pointing to his portraitdefinitely demanded that he should be calledprince vasili looked questioningly at the princess but could not makeout whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she wassimply looking at himthere is one thing i constantly pray god to grant mon cousin shereplied and it is that he would be merciful to him and would allow hisnoble soul peacefully to leave thisyes yes of course interrupted prince vasili impatiently rubbinghis bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table thathe had pushed away but in short the fact is you know yourselfthat last winter the count made a will by which he left all hisproperty not to us his direct heirs but to pierrehe has made wills enough quietly remarked the princess but hecannot leave the estate to pierre pierre is illegitimatebut my dear said prince vasili suddenly clutching the little tableand becoming more animated and talking more rapidly what if a letterhas been written to the emperor in which the count asks for pierreslegitimation do you understand that in consideration of the countsservices his request would be grantedthe princess smiled as people do who think they know more about thesubject under discussion than those they are talking withi can tell you more continued prince vasili seizing her hand thatletter was written though it was not sent and the emperor knew of itthe only question is has it been destroyed or not if not then as soonas all is over and prince vasili sighed to intimate what he meant bythe words all is over and the counts papers are opened the will andletter will be delivered to the emperor and the petition will certainlybe granted pierre will get everything as the legitimate sonand our share asked the princess smiling ironically as if anythingmight happen only not thatbut my poor catiche it is as clear as daylight he will then be thelegal heir to everything and you wont get anything you must know mydear whether the will and letter were written and whether they havebeen destroyed or not and if they have somehow been overlooked youought to know where they are and must find them becausewhat next the princess interrupted smiling sardonically and notchanging the expression of her eyes i am a woman and you think we areall stupid but i know this an illegitimate son cannot inherit unbatard  she added as if supposing that this translation of the wordwould effectively prove to prince vasili the invalidity of hiscontention a bastardwell really catiche cant you understand you are so intelligenthow is it you dont see that if the count has written a letter to theemperor begging him to recognize pierre as legitimate it follows thatpierre will not be pierre but will become count bezukhov and will theninherit everything under the will and if the will and letter are notdestroyed then you will have nothing but the consolation of having beendutiful et tout ce qui sensuit  thats certain and all that follows therefromi know the will was made but i also know that it is invalid and youmon cousin seem to consider me a perfect fool said the princess withthe expression women assume when they suppose they are saying somethingwitty and stingingmy dear princess catherine semenovna began prince vasili impatientlyi came here not to wrangle with you but to talk about your interestsas with a kinswoman a good kind true relation and i tell you for thetenth time that if the letter to the emperor and the will in pierresfavor are among the counts papers then my dear girl you and yoursisters are not heiresses if you dont believe me then believe anexpert i have just been talking to dmitri onufrich the familysolicitor and he says the sameat this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess ideas herthin lips grew white though her eyes did not change and her voice whenshe began to speak passed through such transitions as she herselfevidently did not expectthat would be a fine thing said she i never wanted anything and idont nowshe pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dressand this is gratitudethis is recognition for those who havesacrificed everything for his sake she cried its splendid fine idont want anything princeyes but you are not the only one there are your sisters repliedprince vasilibut the princess did not listen to himyes i knew it long ago but had forgotten i knew that i could expectnothing but meanness deceit envy intrigue and ingratitudetheblackest ingratitudein this housedo you or do you not know where that will is insisted prince vasilihis cheeks twitching more than everyes i was a fool i still believed in people loved them andsacrificed myself but only the base the vile succeed i know who hasbeen intriguingthe princess wished to rise but the prince held her by the hand shehad the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human raceshe gave her companion an angry glancethere is still time my dear you must remember catiche that it wasall done casually in a moment of anger of illness and was afterwardsforgotten our duty my dear is to rectify his mistake to ease hislast moments by not letting him commit this injustice and not to lethim die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those whowho sacrificed everything for him chimed in the princess who wouldagain have risen had not the prince still held her fast though henever could appreciate it no mon cousin she added with a sigh ishall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward thatin this world there is neither honor nor justice in this world one hasto be cunning and cruelnow come come be reasonable i know your excellent heartno i have a wicked hearti know your heart repeated the prince i value your friendship andwish you to have as good an opinion of me dont upset yourself and letus talk sensibly while there is still time be it a day or be it but anhour tell me all you know about the will and above all where it isyou must know we will take it at once and show it to the count he hasno doubt forgotten it and will wish to destroy it you understand thatmy sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his wishes that is myonly reason for being here i came simply to help him and younow i see it all i

infamous vilewomando not let us lose any timeah dont talk to me last winter she wheedled herself in here and toldthe count such vile disgraceful things about us especially aboutsophiei cant repeat themthat it made the count quite ill and hewould not see us for a whole fortnight i know it was then he wrote thisvile infamous paper but i thought the thing was invalidweve got to it at lastwhy did you not tell me about it soonerits in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow said theprincess ignoring his question now i know yes if i have a sin agreat sin it is hatred of that vile woman almost shrieked theprincess now quite changed and what does she come worming herself inhere for but i will give her a piece of my mind the time will comewhile these conversations were going on in the reception room and theprincess room a carriage containing pierre who had been sent for andanna mikhaylovna who found it necessary to accompany him was drivinginto the court of count bezukhovs house as the wheels rolled softlyover the straw beneath the windows anna mikhaylovna having turned withwords of comfort to her companion realized that he was asleep in hiscorner and woke him up rousing himself pierre followed annamikhaylovna out of the carriage and only then began to think of theinterview with his dying father which awaited him he noticed that theyhad not come to the front entrance but to the back door while he wasgetting down from the carriage steps two men who looked liketradespeople ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow ofthe wall pausing for a moment pierre noticed several other men of thesame kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides but neitheranna mikhaylovna nor the footman nor the coachman who could not helpseeing these people took any notice of them it seems to be allright pierre concluded and followed anna mikhaylovna she hurriedlyascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase calling to pierre whowas lagging behind to follow though he did not see why it wasnecessary for him to go to the count at all still less why he had to goby the back stairs yet judging by anna mikhaylovnas air of assuranceand haste pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessaryhalfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men whocarrying pails came running downstairs their boots clattering thesemen pressed close to the wall to let pierre and anna mikhaylovna passand did not evince the least surprise at seeing them thereis this the way to the princesses apartments asked anna mikhaylovnaof one of themyes replied a footman in a bold loud voice as if anything were nowpermissible the door to the left maamperhaps the count did not ask for me said pierre when he reached thelanding id better go to my own roomanna mikhaylovna paused and waited for him to come upah my friend she said touching his arm as she had done her sonswhen speaking to him that afternoon believe me i suffer no less thanyou do but be a manbut really hadnt i better go away he asked looking kindly at herover his spectaclesah my dear friend forget the wrongs that may have been done youthink that he is your father perhaps in the agony of death shesighed i have loved you like a son from the first trust yourself tome pierre i shall not forget your interestspierre did not understand a word but the conviction that all this hadto be grew stronger and he meekly followed anna mikhaylovna who wasalready opening a doorthis door led into a back anteroom an old man a servant of theprincesses sat in a corner knitting a stocking pierre had never beenin this part of the house and did not even know of the existence ofthese rooms anna mikhaylovna addressing a maid who was hurrying pastwith a decanter on a tray as my dear and my sweet asked about theprincess health and then led pierre along a stone passage the firstdoor on the left led into the princesses apartments the maid with thedecanter in her haste had not closed the door everything in the housewas done in haste at that time and pierre and anna mikhaylovna inpassing instinctively glanced into the room where prince vasili and theeldest princess were sitting close together talking seeing them passprince vasili drew back with obvious impatience while the princessjumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with allher mightthis action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted onprince vasilis face so out of keeping with his dignity that pierrestopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide annamikhaylovna evinced no surprise she only smiled faintly and sighed asif to say that this was no more than she had expectedbe a man my friend i will look after your interests said she inreply to his look and went still faster along the passagepierre could not make out what it was all about and still less whatwatching over his interests meant but he decided that all thesethings had to be from the passage they went into a large dimly litroom adjoining the counts reception room it was one of those sumptuousbut cold apartments known to pierre only from the front approach buteven in this room there now stood an empty bath and water had beenspilled on the carpet they were met by a deacon with a censer and by aservant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them they went intothe reception room familiar to pierre with two italian windows openinginto the conservatory with its large bust and full length portrait ofcatherine the great the same people were still sitting here in almostthe same positions as before whispering to one another all becamesilent and turned to look at the pale tearworn anna mikhaylovna as sheentered and at the big stout figure of pierre who hanging his headmeekly followed heranna mikhaylovnas face expressed a consciousness that the decisivemoment had arrived with the air of a practical petersburg lady she nowkeeping pierre close beside her entered the room even more boldly thanthat afternoon she felt that as she brought with her the person thedying man wished to see her own admission was assured casting a rapidglance at all those in the room and noticing the counts confessorthere she glided up to him with a sort of amble not exactly bowing yetseeming to grow suddenly smaller and respectfully received the blessingfirst of one and then of another priestgod be thanked that you are in time said she to one of the priestsall we relatives have been in such anxiety this young man is thecounts son she added more softly what a terrible momenthaving said this she went up to the doctordear doctor said she this young man is the counts son is thereany hopethe doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged hisshoulders anna mikhaylovna with just the same movement raised hershoulders and eyes almost closing the latter sighed and moved awayfrom the doctor to pierre to him in a particularly respectful andtenderly sad voice she saidtrust in his mercy and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit andwait for her she went silently toward the door that everyone waswatching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind itpierre having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly movedtoward the sofa she had indicated as soon as anna mikhaylovna haddisappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to himwith something more than curiosity and sympathy he noticed that theywhispered to one another casting significant looks at him with a kindof awe and even servility a deference such as he had never beforereceived was shown him a strange lady the one who had been talking tothe priests rose and offered him her seat an aidedecamp picked upand returned a glove pierre had dropped the doctors became respectfullysilent as he passed by and moved to make way for him at first pierrewished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady and also topick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were noteven in his way but all at once he felt that this would not do andthat tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful ritewhich everyone expected of him and that he was therefore bound toaccept their services he took the glove in silence from the aidedecamp and sat down in the ladys chair placing his huge handssymmetrically on his knees in the naive attitude of an egyptian statueand decided in his own mind that all was as it should be and that inorder not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on hisown ideas tonight but must yield himself up entirely to the will ofthose who were guiding himnot two minutes had passed before prince vasili with head erectmajestically entered the room he was wearing his long coat with threestars on his breast he seemed to have grown thinner since the morninghis eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticedpierre he went up to him took his hand a thing he never used to doand drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmlyfixed oncourage courage my friend he has asked to see you that is welland he turned to gobut pierre thought it necessary to ask how is and hesitated notknowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man the countyet ashamed to call him fatherhe had another stroke about half an hour ago courage my friendpierres mind was in such a confused state that the word strokesuggested to him a blow from something he looked at prince vasili inperplexity and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack ofillness prince vasili said something to lorrain in passing and wentthrough the door on tiptoe he could not walk well on tiptoe and hiswhole body jerked at each step the eldest princess followed him andthe priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the doorthrough that door was heard a noise of things being moved about and atlast anna mikhaylovna still with the same expression pale but resolutein the discharge of duty ran out and touching pierre lightly on the armsaidthe divine mercy is inexhaustible unction is about to be administeredcomepierre went in at the door stepping on the soft carpet and noticedthat the strange lady the aidedecamp and some of the servants allfollowed him in as if there were now no further need for permission toenter that roompierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch itswalls hung round with persian carpets the part of the room behind thecolumns with a high silkcurtained mahogany bedstead on one side and onthe other an immense case containing icons was brightly illuminatedwith red light like a russian church during evening service under thegleaming icons stood a long invalid chair and in that chair on snowywhite smooth pillows evidently freshly changed pierre sawcovered tothe waist by a bright green quiltthe familiar majestic figure of hisfather count bezukhov with that gray mane of hair above his broadforehead which reminded one of a lion and the deep characteristicallynoble wrinkles of his handsome ruddy face he lay just under the iconshis large thick hands outside the quilt into the right hand which waslying palm downwards a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger andthumb and an old servant bending over from behind the chair held itin position by the chair stood the priests their long hair fallingover their magnificent glittering vestments with lighted tapers intheir hands slowly and solemnly conducting the service a little behindthem stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to theireyes and just in front of them their eldest sister catiche with avicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons as thoughdeclaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she glanceround anna mikhaylovna with a meek sorrowful and allforgivingexpression on her face stood by the door near the strange lady princevasili in front of the door near the invalid chair a wax taper in hisleft hand was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chairhe had turned round for the purpose and was crossing himself with hisright hand turning his eyes upward each time he touched his foreheadhis face wore a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of godif you do not understand these sentiments he seemed to be saying somuch the worse for youbehind him stood the aidedecamp the doctors and the menservants themen and women had separated as in church all were silently crossingthemselves and the reading of the church service the subdued chantingof deep bass voices and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling offeet were the only sounds that could be heard anna mikhaylovna with anair of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she wasabout went across the room to where pierre was standing and gave him ataper he lit it and distracted by observing those around him begancrossing himself with the hand that held the tapersophie the rosy laughterloving youngest princess with the molewatched him she smiled hid her face in her handkerchief and remainedwith it hidden for awhile then looking up and seeing pierre she againbegan to laugh she evidently felt unable to look at him withoutlaughing but could not resist looking at him so to be out oftemptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns in the midstof the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased they whisperedto one another and the old servant who was holding the counts hand gotup and said something to the ladies anna mikhaylovna stepped forwardand stooping over the dying man beckoned to lorrain from behind herback the french doctor held no taper he was leaning against one of thecolumns in a respectful attitude implying that he a foreigner in spiteof all differences of faith understood the full importance of the ritenow being performed and even approved of it he now approached the sickman with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life with hisdelicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that wasfree and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment thesick man was given something to drink there was a stir around him thenthe people resumed their places and the service continued during thisinterval pierre noticed that prince vasili left the chair on which hehad been leaning andwith an air which intimated that he knew what hewas about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worsefor themdid not go up to the dying man but passed by him joined theeldest princess and moved with her to the side of the room where stoodthe high bedstead with its silken hangings on leaving the bed bothprince vasili and the princess passed out by a back door but returnedto their places one after the other before the service was concludedpierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest ofwhat went on having made up his mind once for all that what he sawhappening around him that evening was in some way essentialthe chanting of the service ceased and the voice of the priest washeard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received thesacrament the dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before aroundhim everyone began to stir steps were audible and whispers among whichanna mikhaylovnas was the most distinctpierre heard her saycertainly he must be moved onto the bed here it will be impossiblethe sick man was so surrounded by doctors princesses and servants thatpierre could no longer see the reddishyellow face with its gray manewhich though he saw other faces as well he had not lost sight of for asingle moment during the whole service he judged by the cautiousmovements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they hadlifted the dying man and were moving himcatch hold of my arm or youll drop him he heard one of the servantssay in a frightened whisper catch hold from underneath hereexclaimed different voices and the heavy breathing of the bearers andthe shuffling of their feet grew more hurried as if the weight theywere carrying were too much for themas the bearers among whom was anna mikhaylovna passed the young man hecaught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dyingmans high stout uncovered chest and powerful shoulders raised bythose who were holding him under the armpits and of his gray curlyleonine head this head with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbonesits handsome sensual mouth and its cold majestic expression was notdisfigured by the approach of death it was the same as pierreremembered it three months before when the count had sent him topetersburg but now this head was swaying helplessly with the unevenmovements of the bearers and the cold listless gaze fixed itself uponnothingafter a few minutes bustle beside the high bedstead those who hadcarried the sick man dispersed anna mikhaylovna touched pierres handand said come pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick manhad been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony justcompleted he lay with his head propped high on the pillows his handswere symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt the palms downwardwhen pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him but with alook the significance of which could not be understood by mortal maneither this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes theymust look somewhere or it meant too much pierre hesitated not knowingwhat to do and glanced inquiringly at his guide anna mikhaylovna madea hurried sign with her eyes glancing at the sick mans hand and movingher lips as if to send it a kiss pierre carefully stretching his neckso as not to touch the quilt followed her suggestion and pressed hislips to the large boned fleshy hand neither the hand nor a singlemuscle of the counts face stirred once more pierre lookedquestioningly at anna mikhaylovna to see what he was to do next annamikhaylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bedpierre obediently sat down his eyes asking if he were doing right annamikhaylovna nodded approvingly again pierre fell into the naivelysymmetrical pose of an egyptian statue evidently distressed that hisstout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to lookas small as possible he looked at the count who still gazed at thespot where pierres face had been before he sat down anna mikhaylovnaindicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importanceof these last moments of meeting between the father and son this lastedabout two minutes which to pierre seemed an hour suddenly the broadmuscles and lines of the counts face began to twitch the twitchingincreased the handsome mouth was drawn to one side only now did pierrerealize how near death his father was and from that distorted mouthissued an indistinct hoarse sound anna mikhaylovna looked attentivelyat the sick mans eyes trying to guess what he wanted she pointedfirst to pierre then to some drink then named prince vasili in aninquiring whisper then pointed to the quilt the eyes and face of thesick man showed impatience he made an effort to look at the servant whostood constantly at the head of the bedwants to turn on the other side whispered the servant and got up toturn the counts heavy body toward the wallpierre rose to help himwhile the count was being turned over one of his arms fell backhelplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward whether henoticed the look of terror with which pierre regarded that lifeless armor whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain at anyrate he glanced at the refractory arm at pierres terrorstricken faceand again at the arm and on his face a feeble piteous smile appearedquite out of keeping with his features that seemed to deride his ownhelplessness at sight of this smile pierre felt an unexpected quiveringin his breast and a tickling in his nose and tears dimmed his eyes thesick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall he sighedhe is dozing said anna mikhaylovna observing that one of theprincesses was coming to take her turn at watching let us gopierre went outthere was now no one in the reception room except prince vasili and theeldest princess who were sitting under the portrait of catherine thegreat and talking eagerly as soon as they saw pierre and his companionthey became silent and pierre thought he saw the princess hidesomething as she whisperedi cant bear the sight of that womancatiche has had tea served in the small drawing room said princevasili to anna mikhaylovna go and take something my poor annamikhaylovna or you will not hold outto pierre he said nothing merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeezebelow the shoulder pierre went with anna mikhaylovna into the smalldrawing roomthere is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of thisdelicious russian tea lorrain was saying with an air of restrainedanimation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate chinese handleless cupbefore a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the smallcircular room around the table all who were at count bezukhovs housethat night had gathered to fortify themselves pierre well rememberedthis small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tablesduring balls given at the house pierre who did not know how to dancehad liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who as they passedthrough in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bareshoulders looked at themselves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors whichrepeated their reflections several times now this same room was dimlylighted by two candles on one small table tea things and supper dishesstood in disorder and in the middle of the night a motley throng ofpeople sat there not merrymaking but somberly whispering andbetraying by every word and movement that they none of them forgot whatwas happening and what was about to happen in the bedroom pierre didnot eat anything though he would very much have liked to he lookedinquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoeto the reception room where they had left prince vasili and the eldestprincess pierre concluded that this also was essential and after ashort interval followed her anna mikhaylovna was standing beside theprincess and they were both speaking in excited whisperspermit me princess to know what is necessary and what is notnecessary said the younger of the two speakers evidently in the samestate of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her roombut my dear princess answered anna mikhaylovna blandly butimpressively blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the otherfrom passing wont this be too much for poor uncle at a moment when heneeds repose worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is alreadypreparedprince vasili was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude withone leg crossed high above the other his cheeks which were so flabbythat they looked heavier below were twitching violently but he worethe air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were sayingcome my dear anna mikhaylovna let catiche do as she pleases you knowhow fond the count is of heri dont even know what is in this paper said the younger of the twoladies addressing prince vasili and pointing to an inlaid portfolio sheheld in her hand all i know is that his real

theportfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily dearprincess i beg and implore you have some pity on him je vous enconjurethe princess did not reply their efforts in the struggle for theportfolio were the only sounds audible but it was evident that if theprincess did speak her words would not be flattering to annamikhaylovna though the latter held on tenaciously her voice lost noneof its honeyed firmness and softnesspierre my dear come here i think he will not be out of place in afamily consultation is it not so princewhy dont you speak cousin suddenly shrieked the princess so loudthat those in the drawing room heard her and were startled why do youremain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere makinga scene on the very threshold of a dying mans room intriguer shehissed viciously and tugged with all her might at the portfoliobut anna mikhaylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on theportfolio and changed her gripprince vasili rose oh

consequences said prince vasiliseverely you dont know what you are doingvile woman shouted the princess darting unexpectedly at annamikhaylovna and snatching the portfolio from herprince vasili bent his head and spread out his handsat this moment that terrible door which pierre had watched so long andwhich had always opened so quietly burst noisily open and bangedagainst the wall and the second of the three sisters rushed outwringing her handswhat are you doing she cried vehemently he is dying and you leaveme alone with himher sister dropped the portfolio anna mikhaylovna stooping quicklycaught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom the eldestprincess and prince vasili recovering themselves followed her a fewminutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face againbiting her underlip at sight of pierre her expression showed anirrepressible hatredyes now you may be glad said she this is what you have beenwaiting for and bursting into tears she hid her face in herhandkerchief and rushed from the roomprince vasili came next he staggered to the sofa on which pierre wassitting and dropped onto it covering his face with his hand pierrenoticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in anagueah my friend said he taking pierre by the elbow and there was inhis voice a sincerity and weakness pierre had never observed in itbefore how often we sin how much we deceive and all for what i amnear sixty dear friend i too all will end in death all death isawful and he burst into tearsanna mikhaylovna came out last she approached pierre with slow quietstepspierre she saidpierre gave her an inquiring look she kissed the young man on hisforehead wetting him with her tears then after a pause she saidhe is no morepierre looked at her over his spectaclescome i will go with you try to weep nothing gives such relief astearsshe led him into the dark drawing room and pierre was glad no one couldsee his face anna mikhaylovna left

mikhaylovna after her talk with pierre annamikhaylovna returned to the rostovs and went to bed on waking in themorning she told the rostovs and all her acquaintances the details ofcount bezukhovs death she said the count had died as she would herselfwish to die that his end was not only touching but edifying as to thelast meeting between father and son it was so touching that she couldnot think of it without tears and did not know which had behaved betterduring those awful momentsthe father who so remembered everything andeverybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son orpierre whom it had been pitiful to see so stricken was he with griefthough he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his dying fatherit is painful but it does one good it uplifts the soul to see suchmen as the old count and his worthy son said she of the behavior ofthe eldest princess and prince vasili she spoke disapprovingly but inwhispers and as a great secretat bald hills prince nicholas andreevich bolkonskis estate thearrival of young prince andrew and his wife was daily expected but thisexpectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the oldprinces household

princess mary and her companion mademoisellebourienne though in the new reign he was free to return to thecapitals he still continued to live in the country remarking thatanyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from moscow tobald hills while he himself needed no one and nothing he used to saythat there are only two sources of human viceidleness andsuperstition and only two virtuesactivity and intelligence hehimself undertook his daughters education and to develop these twocardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry tillshe was twenty and arranged her life so that her whole time wasoccupied he was himself always occupied writing his memoirs solvingproblems in higher mathematics turning snuffboxes on a lathe workingin the garden or superintending the building that was always going onat his estate as regularity is a prime condition facilitating activityregularity in his household was carried to the highest point ofexactitude he always came to table under precisely the same conditionsand not only at the same hour but at the same minute with those abouthim from his daughter to his serfs the prince was sharp and invariablyexacting so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fearand respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused although he wasin retirement and had now no influence in political affairs every highofficial appointed to the province in which the princes estate layconsidered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamberjust as the architect gardener or princess mary did till the princeappeared punctually to the appointed hour everyone sitting in thisantechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear whenthe enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rathersmall old man with powdered wig small withered hands and bushy grayeyebrows which when he frowned sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewdyouthfully glittering eyeson the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive princessmary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for themorning greeting crossing herself with trepidation and repeating asilent prayer every morning she came in like that and every morningprayed that the daily interview might pass off wellan old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rosequietly and said in a whisper please walk inthrough the door came the regular hum of a lathe the princess timidlyopened the door which moved noiselessly and easily she paused at theentrance the prince was working at the lathe and after glancing roundcontinued his workthe enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use thelarge table covered with books and plans the tall glassfrontedbookcases with keys in the locks the high desk for writing whilestanding up on which lay an open exercise book and the lathe withtools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered aroundall indicatedcontinuous varied and orderly activity the motion of the small footshod in a tartar boot embroidered with silver and the firm pressure ofthe lean sinewy hand showed that the prince still possessed thetenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age after a few more turnsof the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal wiped his chiseldropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe and approachingthe table summoned his daughter he never gave his children a blessingso he simply held out his bristly cheek as yet unshaven and regardingher tenderly and attentively said severelyquite well all right then sit down he took the exercise bookcontaining lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chairwith his footfor tomorrow said he quickly finding the page and making a scratchfrom one paragraph to another with his hard nailthe princess bent over the exercise book on the tablewait a bit heres a letter for you said the old man suddenly takinga letter addressed in a womans hand from a bag hanging above the tableonto which he threw itat the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on theprincess face she took it quickly and bent her head over itfrom heloise asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his stillsound yellowish teethyes its from julie replied the princess with a timid glance and atimid smileill let two more letters pass but the third ill read said theprince sternly im afraid you write much nonsense ill read thethirdread this if you like father said the princess blushing still moreand holding out the letterthe third i said the third cried the prince abruptly pushing theletter away and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him theexercise book containing geometrical figureswell madam he began stooping over the book close to his daughterand placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat so thatshe felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of old ageand tobacco which she had known so long now madam these trianglesare equal please note that the angle abcthe princess looked in a scared way at her fathers eyes glitteringclose to her the red patches on her face came and went and it wasplain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her fearwould prevent her understanding any of her fathers furtherexplanations however clear they might be whether it was the teachersfault or the pupils this same thing happened every day the princesseyes grew dim she could not see and could not hear anything but wasonly conscious of her stern fathers withered face close to her of hisbreath and the smell of him and could think only of how to get awayquickly to her own room to make out the problem in peace the old manwas beside himself moved the chair on which he was sitting noisilybackward and forward made efforts to control himself and not becomevehement but almost always did become vehement scolded and sometimesflung the exercise book awaythe princess gave a wrong answerwell now isnt she a fool shouted the prince pushing the book asideand turning sharply away but rising immediately he paced up and downlightly touched his daughters hair and sat down againhe drew up his chair and continued to explainthis wont do princess it wont do said he when princess maryhaving taken and closed the exercise book with the next days lessonwas about to leave mathematics are most important

gesture and took an uncutbook from the high deskhere is some sort of key to the mysteries that your heloise has sentyou religious i dont interfere with anyones belief i have lookedat it take it well now go gohe patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after herprincess mary went back to her room with the sad scared expression thatrarely left her and which made her plain sickly face yet plainer shesat down at her writing table on which stood miniature portraits andwhich was littered with books and papers the princess was as untidy asher father was tidy she put down the geometry book and eagerly brokethe seal of her letter it was from her most intimate friend fromchildhood that same julie karagina who had been at the rostovs nameday partyjulie wrote in frenchdear and precious friend how terrible and frightful a thing isseparation though i tell myself that half my life and half my happinessare wrapped up in you and that in spite of the distance separating usour hearts are united by indissoluble bonds my heart rebels againstfate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me i cannotovercome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since weparted why are we not together as we were last summer in your bigstudy on the blue sofa the confidential sofa why cannot i now asthree months ago draw fresh moral strength from your look so gentlecalm and penetrating a look i loved so well and seem to see before meas i writehaving read thus far princess mary sighed and glanced into the mirrorwhich stood on her right it reflected a weak ungraceful figure andthin face her eyes always sad now looked with particular hopelessnessat her reflection in the glass she flatters me thought the princessturning away and continuing to read but julie did not flatter herfriend the princess eyeslarge deep and luminous it seemed as if attimes there radiated from them shafts of warm lightwere so beautifulthat very often in spite of the plainness of her face they gave her anattraction more powerful than that of beauty but the princess never sawthe beautiful expression of her own eyesthe look they had when she wasnot thinking of herself as with everyone her face assumed a forcedunnatural expression as soon as she looked in a glass she went onreadingall moscow talks of nothing but war one of my two brothers is alreadyabroad the other is with the guards who are starting on their march tothe frontier our dear emperor has left petersburg and it is thoughtintends to expose his precious person to the chances of war god grantthat the corsican monster who is destroying the peace of europe may beoverthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the almighty in hisgoodness to give us as sovereign to say nothing of my brothers thiswar has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart i meanyoung nicholas rostov who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remaininactive and has left the university to join the army i will confess toyou dear mary that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for thearmy was a great grief to me this young man of whom i spoke to youlast summer is so nobleminded and full of that real youthfulness whichone seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and particularlyhe is so frank and has so much heart he is so pure and poetic that myrelations with him transient as they were have been one of thesweetest comforts to my poor heart which has already suffered so muchsomeday i will tell you about our parting and all that was said thenthat is still too fresh ah dear friend you are happy not to knowthese poignant joys and sorrows you are fortunate for the latter aregenerally the stronger i know very well that count nicholas is tooyoung ever to be more to me than a friend but this sweet friendshipthis poetic and pure intimacy were what my heart needed but enough ofthis the chief news about which all moscow gossips is the death ofold count bezukhov and his inheritance fancy the three princesseshave received very little prince vasili nothing and it is monsieurpierre who has inherited all the property and has besides beenrecognized as legitimate so that he is now count bezukhov and possessorof the finest fortune in russia it is rumored that prince vasili playeda very despicable part in this affair and that he returned to petersburgquite crestfalleni confess i understand very little about all these matters of wills andinheritance but i do know that since this young man whom we all usedto know as plain monsieur pierre has become count bezukhov and theowner of one of the largest fortunes in russia i am much amused towatch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened bymarriageable daughters and of the young ladies themselves toward himthough between you and me he always seemed to me a poor sort offellow as for the past two years people have amused themselves byfinding husbands for me most of whom i dont even know thematchmaking chronicles of moscow now speak of me as the future countessbezukhova but you will understand that i have no desire for the post apropos of marriages do you know that a while ago that universal auntieanna mikhaylovna told me under the seal of strict secrecy of a plan ofmarriage for you it is neither more nor less than with prince vasilisson anatole whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone richand distinguee and it is on you that his relations choice has falleni dont know what you will think of it but i consider it my duty to letyou know of it he is said to be very handsome and a terriblescapegrace that is all i have been able to find out about himbut enough of gossip i am at the end of my second sheet of paper andmamma has sent for me to go and dine at the apraksins read themystical book i am sending you it has an enormous success here thoughthere are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp itis an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul adieu give myrespects to monsieur your father and my compliments to mademoisellebourienne i embrace you as i love youjulieps let me have news of your brother and his charming little wifethe princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminouseyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed then she suddenlyrose and with her heavy tread went up to the table she took a sheet ofpaper and her hand moved rapidly over it this is the reply she wrotealso in frenchdear and precious friend your letter of the th has given me greatdelight so you still love me my romantic julie separation of whichyou say so much that is bad does not seem to have had its usual effecton you you complain of our separation what then should i say if idared complain i who am deprived of all who are dear to me ah if wehad not religion to console us life would be very sad why do yousuppose that i should look severely on your affection for that youngman on such matters i am only severe with myself i understand suchfeelings in others and if never having felt them i cannot approve ofthem neither do i condemn them only it seems to me that christianlove love of ones neighbor love of ones enemy is worthier sweeterand better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a young man caninspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourselfthe news of count bezukhovs death reached us before your letter and myfather was much affected by it he says the count was the lastrepresentative but one of the great century and that it is his own turnnow but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late aspossible god preserve us from that terrible misfortunei cannot agree with you about pierre whom i knew as a child he alwaysseemed to me to have an excellent heart and that is the quality i valuemost in people as to his inheritance and the part played by princevasili it is very sad for both ah my dear friend our divinesaviours words that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye ofa needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god are terriblytrue i pity prince vasili but am still more sorry for pierre so youngand burdened with such richesto what temptations he will be exposedif i were asked what i desire most on earth it would be to be poorerthan the poorest beggar a thousand thanks dear friend for the volumeyou have sent me and which has such success in moscow yet since youtell me that among some good things it contains others which our weakhuman understanding cannot grasp it seems to me rather useless to spendtime in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruiti never could understand the fondness some people have for confusingtheir minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken theirdoubts and excite their imagination giving them a bent for exaggerationquite contrary to christian simplicity let us rather read the epistlesand gospels let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they containfor how can we miserable sinners that we are know the terrible andholy secrets of providence while we remain in this flesh which forms animpenetrable veil between us and the eternal let us rather confineourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine saviour hasleft for our guidance here below let us try to conform to them andfollow them and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeblehuman minds roam the better we shall please god who rejects allknowledge that does not come from him and the less we seek to fathomwhat he has been pleased to conceal from us the sooner will hevouchsafe its revelation to us through his divine spiritmy father has not spoken to me of a suitor but has only told me that hehas received a letter and is expecting a visit from prince vasili inregard to this project of marriage for me i will tell you dear sweetfriend that i look on marriage as a divine institution to which we mustconform however painful it may be to me should the almighty lay theduties of wife and mother upon me i shall try to perform them asfaithfully as i can without disquieting myself by examining my feelingstoward him whom he may give me for husbandi have had a letter from my brother who announces his speedy arrival atbald hills with his wife this pleasure will be but a brief onehowever for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy warinto which we have been drawn god knows how or why not only where youareat the heart of affairs and of the worldis the talk all of wareven here amid fieldwork and the calm of naturewhich townsfolkconsider characteristic of the countryrumors of war are heard andpainfully felt my father talks of nothing but marches andcountermarches things of which i understand nothing and the day beforeyesterday during my daily walk through the village i witnessed aheartrending scene it was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from ourpeople and starting to join the army you should have seen the state ofthe mothers wives and children of the men who were going and shouldhave heard the sobs it seems as though mankind has forgotten the lawsof its divine saviour who preached love and forgiveness of injuriesand that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing oneanotheradieu dear and kind friend may our divine saviour and his most holymother keep you in their holy and allpowerful caremaryah you are sending off a letter princess i have already dispatchedmine i have written to my poor mother said the smiling mademoisellebourienne rapidly in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural rsshe brought into princess marys strenuous mournful and

clavichord went into the sittingroom with a look of alarm between twelve and two oclock as the daywas mapped out the prince rested and the princess played theclavichordthe grayhaired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring ofthe prince who was in his large study from the far side of the housethrough the closed doors came the sound of difficult passagestwentytimes repeatedof a sonata by

tikhon wearinga wig put his head out of the door of the antechamber reported in awhisper that the prince was sleeping and hastily closed the doortikhon knew that neither the sons arrival nor any other unusual eventmust be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day prince andrewapparently knew this as well as tikhon he looked at his watch as if toascertain whether his fathers habits had changed since he was at homelast and having assured himself that they had not he turned to hiswifehe will get up in twenty minutes let us go across to marys room hesaidthe little princess had grown

unpleasantthe little princess entered the room the passage broke off in themiddle a cry was heard then princess marys heavy tread and the soundof kissing when prince andrew went in the two princesses who had onlymet once before for a short time at his wedding were in each othersarms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened totouch mademoiselle bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to herheart with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or tolaugh prince andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned as lovers ofmusic do when they hear a false note the two women let go of oneanother and then as if afraid of being too late seized each othershands kissing them and pulling them away and again began kissing eachother on the face and then to prince andrews surprise both began tocry and kissed again mademoiselle bourienne also began to cry princeandrew evidently felt ill at ease but to the two women it seemed quitenatural that they should cry and apparently it never entered theirheads that it could have been otherwise at this meetingah my dear ah mary they suddenly exclaimed and then laughedi dreamed last nightyou were not expecting us ah

luminous eyes very beautiful at that momentrested on prince andrews facethe little princess talked incessantly her short downy upper lipcontinually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary anddrawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile ofglittering teeth and sparkling eyes she told of an accident they hadhad on the spasski hill which might have been serious for her in hercondition and immediately after that informed them that she had leftall her clothes in petersburg and that heaven knew what she would haveto dress in here and that andrew had quite changed and that kittyodyntsova had married an old man and that there was a suitor for marya real one but that they would talk of that later princess mary wasstill looking silently at her brother and

lifewhen the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the oldprince to get up tikhon came to call the young prince to his fatherthe old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of hissons arrival he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while hedressed for dinner the old prince always dressed in oldfashionedstyle wearing an antique coat and powdered hair and when prince andrewentered his fathers dressing room not with the contemptuous look andmanner he wore in drawing rooms but with the animated face with whichhe talked to pierre the old man was sitting on a large leathercoveredchair wrapped in a powdering mantle entrusting his head to tikhonah heres the warrior wants to vanquish buonaparte said the oldman shaking his powdered head as much as the tail which

how two hundred and twentythousand austrians with a hundred thousand russians were to operate initaly and on the rhine how fifty thousand russians and as many englishwere to land at naples and how a

mademoisellebourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect who bya strange caprice of his employers was admitted to table though theposition of that insignificant individual was such as could certainlynot have caused him to expect that honor the prince who generally keptvery strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even importantgovernment officials to his table had unexpectedly selected michaelivanovich who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checkedhandkerchief to illustrate the theory that all men are equals and hadmore than once impressed on his daughter that michael ivanovich was nota whit worse than you or i at dinner the prince usually spoke to thetaciturn michael ivanovich more often than to anyone elsein the dining room which like all the rooms in the house wasexceedingly lofty the members of the household and the footmenonebehind each chairstood waiting for the prince to enter the headbutler napkin on arm was scanning the setting of the table makingsigns to the footmen and anxiously glancing from the clock to the doorby which the prince was to enter prince andrew was looking at a largegilt frame new to him containing the genealogical tree of the princesbolkonski opposite which hung another such frame with a badly paintedportrait evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estateof a ruling prince in a crownan alleged descendant of rurik andancestor of the bolkonskis prince andrew looking again at thatgenealogical tree shook his head laughing as a man laughs who looks ata portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusinghow thoroughly like him that is he said to princess mary who hadcome up to himprincess mary looked at her brother in surprise she did not understandwhat he was laughing at everything her father did inspired her withreverence and was beyond questioneveryone has his achilles heel continued prince andrew fancy withhis powerful mind indulging in such nonsenseprincess mary could not understand the boldness of her brotherscriticism and was about to reply when the expected footsteps were heardcoming from the study the prince walked in quickly and jauntily as washis wont as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his mannerswith the strict formality of his house at that moment the great clockstruck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawingroom the prince stood still his lively glittering eyes from undertheir thick bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested onthe little princess she felt as courtiers do when the tsar enters thesensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all aroundhim he stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back ofher neckim glad glad to see you he said looking attentively into hereyes and then quickly went to his place and sat down sit down sitdown sit down michael ianovichhe indicated a place beside him to his daughterinlaw a footman movedthe chair for

as much as possible as much as possible he saidthe little princess did not or did not wish to hear his words she wassilent and seemed confused the prince asked her about her father andshe began to smile and talk he asked about mutual acquaintances andshe became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetingsfrom various people and retelling the town gossipcountess apraksina poor thing has lost her husband and she has criedher eyes out she said growing more and more livelyas she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternlyand suddenly as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed adefinite idea of her he turned away and addressed michael ivanovichwell michael ivanovich our bonaparte will be having a bad time of itprince andrew he always spoke thus of his son has been telling mewhat forces are being collected against him while you and i neverthought much of himmichael ivanovich did not at all know when you and i had said suchthings about bonaparte but understanding that he was wanted as a peg onwhich to hang the princes favorite topic he looked inquiringly at theyoung prince wondering what would followhe is a great tactician said the prince to his son pointing to thearchitectand the conversation again turned on the war on bonaparte and thegenerals and statesmen of the day the old prince seemed convinced notonly that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the ab c of war or of politics and that bonaparte was an insignificantlittle frenchy successful only because there were no longer anypotemkins or suvorovs left to oppose him but he was also convinced thatthere were no political difficulties in europe and no real war but onlya sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playingpretending to do something real prince andrew gaily bore with hisfathers ridicule of the new men and drew him on and listened to himwith evident pleasurethe past always seems good said he but did not suvorov himself fallinto a trap moreau set him and from which he did not know how toescapewho told you that who cried the prince suvorov and he jerkedaway his plate which tikhon briskly caught suvorov considerprince andrew two frederick and suvorov moreau moreau wouldhave been a prisoner if suvorov had had a free hand but he had thehofskriegswurstschnappsrath on his hands it would have puzzled thedevil himself

bonaparte you may laugh as much asyou like but all the same bonaparte is a great generalmichael ivanovich cried the old prince to the architect who busywith his roast meat hoped he had been forgotten didnt i tell youbuonaparte was a great tactician here he says the same thingto be sure your excellency replied the architectthe prince again laughed his frigid laughbuonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth he has gotsplendid soldiers besides he began by attacking germans and onlyidlers have failed to beat the germans since the world began everybodyhas beaten the germans they beat no oneexcept one another he madehis reputation fighting themand the prince began explaining all the blunders which according tohim bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics his sonmade no rejoinder but it was evident that whatever arguments werepresented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion helistened refraining from a reply and involuntarily wondered how thisold man living alone in the country for so many years could know anddiscuss so minutely and acutely all the recent european military andpolitical eventsyou think im an old man and dont understand the present state ofaffairs concluded his father but it troubles me i dont sleep atnight come now where has this great commander of yours shown hisskill he concludedthat would take too long to tell

bonapartistdieu sait quand reviendra hummed the prince out of tune and with alaugh still more so he quitted the tablethe little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of thedinner sat silent glancing with a frightened look now at her fatherinlaw and now at princess mary when they left the table she took hersisterinlaws arm and drew her into another roomwhat a clever man your father is said she perhaps that is why i amafraid of himoh he is so kind answered princess maryprince andrew was to leave next evening the old prince not alteringhis routine retired as usual after dinner the

andrews facelooked very thoughtful and tender with his hands behind him he pacedbriskly from corner to corner of the room looking straight before himand thoughtfully shaking his head did he fear going to the war or washe sad at leaving his wifeperhaps both but evidently he did not wishto be seen in that mood for hearing footsteps in the passage hehurriedly unclasped his hands stopped at a table as if tying the coverof the small box and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrableexpression it was the heavy tread of princess mary that he heardi hear you have given orders to harness she cried

andrew but you have a kind of intellectualpride said the princess following the train of her own thoughtsrather than the trend of the conversationand thats a great sin howcan one judge father but even if one might what feeling exceptveneration could such a man as my father evoke and i am so contentedand happy with him i only wish you were all as happy as i amher brother shook his head incredulouslythe only thing that is hard for me i will tell you the truthandrew is fathers way of treating religious subjects i dontunderstand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what

amonk he received and had a long talk withah my dear i am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powdersaid prince andrew banteringly yet tenderlyah mon ami i only pray and hope that god will hear

voiceprince andrew sighed and made no replywell he said turning to his wifeand this well sounded coldly ironic as if he were saying now gothrough your performanceandrew already said the little princess turning pale and lookingwith dismay at her husbandhe embraced her she screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulderhe cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on looked into her faceand carefully placed her in an easy chairadieu mary said he gently to his sister taking her by the hand andkissing her and then he left the room with rapid stepsthe little princess lay in the armchair mademoiselle bourienne chafingher temples princess mary supporting her sisterinlaw still lookedwith her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which princeandrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction fromthe study like pistol shots came the frequent sound of the old manangrily blowing his nose hardly had prince andrew gone when the studydoor opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the whitedressing gown looked outgone thats all right said he and looking angrily at theunconscious little princess he shook his head reprovingly and slammedthe doorin october  a russian army was occupying the villages and towns ofthe archduchy of austria and yet other regiments freshly arriving fromrussia were settling near the fortress of braunau and burdening theinhabitants on whom they were quartered braunau was the headquarters ofthe commanderinchief kutuzovon october   one of the infantry regiments that had just reachedbraunau had halted half a mile from the town waiting to be inspected bythe commanderinchief despite the unrussian appearance of thelocality and surroundingsfruit gardens stone fences tiled roofs andhills in the distanceand despite the fact that the inhabitants whogazed with curiosity at the soldiers were not russians the regimenthad just the appearance of any russian regiment preparing for aninspection anywhere in the heart of russiaon the evening of the last days march an order had been received thatthe commanderinchief would inspect the regiment on the march thoughthe words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander andthe question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order ornot it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commandersto present the regiment in parade order on the principle that it isalways better to bow too low than not bow low enough so the soldiersafter a twentymile march were kept mending and cleaning all night longwithout closing their eyes while the adjutants and company commanderscalculated and reckoned and by morning the regimentinstead of thestraggling disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the daybeforepresented a wellordered array of two thousand men each of whomknew his place and his duty had every button and every strap in placeand shone with cleanliness and not only externally was all in orderbut had it pleased the commanderinchief to look under the uniforms hewould have found on every man a clean shirt and in every knapsack theappointed number of articles awl soap and all as the soldiers saythere was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be atease it was the state of the soldiers boots more than half the mensboots were in holes but this defect was not due to any fault of theregimental commander for in spite of repeated demands boots had notbeen issued by the austrian commissariat and the regiment had marchedsome seven hundred milesthe commander of the regiment was an elderly choleric stout andthickset general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers and wider fromchest to back than across the shoulders he had on a brandnew uniformshowing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epauletteswhich seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders hehad the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties ofhis life he walked about in front of the line and at every step pulledhimself up slightly arching his back it was plain that the commanderadmired his regiment rejoiced in it and that his whole mind wasengrossed by it yet his strut seemed to indicate that besides militarymatters social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of histhoughtswell michael mitrich sir he said addressing one of the battalioncommanders who smilingly pressed forward it was plain that they bothfelt happy we had our hands full last night however i think theregiment is not a bad one ehthe battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughedit would not be turned off the field even on the tsaritsin meadowwhat asked the commanderat that moment on the road from the town on which signalers had beenposted two men appeared on horse back they were an aidedecampfollowed by a cossackthe aidedecamp was sent to confirm the order which had not beenclearly worded the day before namely that the commanderinchiefwished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on themarch in their greatcoats and packs and without any preparationwhatevera member of the hofkriegsrath from vienna had come to kutuzov the daybefore with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army ofthe archduke ferdinand and mack and kutuzov not considering thisjunction advisable meant among other arguments in support of his viewto show the austrian general the wretched state in which the troopsarrived from russia with this object he intended to meet the regimentso the worse the condition it was in the better pleased the commanderinchief would be though the aidedecamp did not know thesecircumstances he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the menshould be in their greatcoats and in marching order and that thecommanderinchief would otherwise be dissatisfied on hearing this theregimental commander hung his head silently shrugged his shoulders andspread out his arms with a choleric gesturea fine mess weve made of it he remarkedthere now didnt i tell you michael mitrich that if it was said onthe march it meant in greatcoats said he reproachfully to thebattalion commander oh my god he added stepping resolutelyforward company commanders he shouted in a voice accustomed tocommand sergeants major how soon will he be here he asked theaidedecamp with a respectful politeness evidently relating to thepersonage he was referring toin an hours time i should sayshall we have time to change clothesi dont know generalthe regimental commander going up to the line himself ordered thesoldiers to change into their greatcoats the company commanders ran offto their companies the sergeants major began bustling the greatcoatswere not in very good condition and instantly the squares that had upto then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch andhum with voices on all sides soldiers were running to and fro throwingup their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the strapsover their heads unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves onwith upraised armsin half an hour all was again in order only the squares had become grayinstead of black the regimental commander walked with his jerky stepsto the front of the regiment and examined it from a distancewhatever is this this he shouted and stood still commander of thethird companycommander of the third company wanted by the general commander tothe general third company to the commander the words passed alongthe lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officerwhen the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in acry of the general to the third company the missing officer appearedfrom behind his company and though he was a middleaged man and not inthe habit of running trotted awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward thegeneral the captains face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who istold to repeat a lesson he has not learned spots appeared on his nosethe redness of which was evidently due to intemperance and his mouthtwitched nervously the general looked the captain up and down as hecame up panting slackening his pace as he approachedyou will soon be dressing your men in petticoats what is thisshouted the regimental commander thrusting forward his jaw and pointingat a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluishcloth which contrasted with the others what have you been after thecommander in chief is expected and you leave your place eh ill teachyou to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade ehthe commander of the company with his

with renewed irritation i begyou to dress your men decentlyand the commander turning to look at the adjutant directed his jerkysteps down the line he was evidently pleased at his own display ofanger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse forwrath having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge at anotherbecause his line was not straight he reached the third companyhoow are you standing wheres your leg your leg shouted thecommander with a tone of suffering in his voice while there were stillfive men between him and dolokhov with his bluishgray

viennese caleche slightly creaking on its springs and drawnby six horses at a smart trot behind the caleche galloped the suite anda convoy of croats beside kutuzov sat an austrian general in a whiteuniform that looked strange among the russian black ones the calechestopped in front of the regiment kutuzov and the austrian general weretalking in low voices and kutuzov smiled slightly as treading heavily hestepped down from the carriage just as if those two thousand menbreathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not existthe word of command rang out and again the regiment quivered as with ajingling sound it presented arms then amidst a dead silence the feeblevoice of the commanderinchief was heard the regiment roared healthto your ex len len lency and again all became silent atfirst kutuzov stood still while the regiment moved then he and thegeneral in white accompanied by the suite walked between the ranksfrom the way the regimental commander saluted the commanderinchief anddevoured him with his eyes drawing himself up obsequiously and fromthe way he walked through the ranks behind the generals bending forwardand hardly able to restrain his jerky movements and from the way hedarted forward at every word or gesture of the commanderinchief itwas evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with evengreater zeal than his duty as a commander thanks to the strictness andassiduity of its commander the regiment in comparison with others thathad reached braunau at the same time was in splendid condition therewere only  sick and stragglers everything was in good order exceptthe bootskutuzov walked through the ranks sometimes stopping to say a fewfriendly words to officers he had known in the turkish war sometimesalso to the soldiers looking at their boots he several times shook hishead sadly pointing them out to the austrian general with an expressionwhich seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone but could not helpnoticing what a bad state of things it was the regimental commander ranforward on each such occasion fearing to miss a single word of thecommanderinchiefs regarding the regiment behind kutuzov at adistance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard followedsome twenty men of his suite these gentlemen talked among themselvesand sometimes laughed nearest of all to the commanderinchief walked ahandsome adjutant this was prince bolkonski beside him was his comradenesvitski a tall staff officer extremely stout with a kindlysmiling handsome face and moist eyes nesvitski could hardly keep fromlaughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked beside himthis hussar with a grave face and without a smile or a change in theexpression of his fixed eyes watched the regimental commanders backand mimicked his every movement each time the commander started andbent forward the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the samemanner nesvitski laughed and nudged the others to make them look at thewagkutuzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which werestarting from their sockets to watch their chief on reaching the thirdcompany he suddenly stopped his suite not having expected thisinvoluntarily came closer to himah timokhin said he recognizing the rednosed captain who had beenreprimanded on account of the blue greatcoatone would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself morethan timokhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimentalcommander but now that the commanderinchief addressed him he drewhimself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustainedit had the commanderinchief continued to look at him and so kutuzovwho evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but goodquickly turned away a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over hisscarred and puffy faceanother ismail comrade said he a brave officer are you satisfiedwith him he asked the regimental commanderand the latterunconscious that he was being reflected in the hussarofficer as in a looking glassstarted moved forward and answeredhighly satisfied your excellencywe all have our weaknesses said kutuzov smiling and walking away fromhim he used to have a predilection for bacchusthe regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and didnot answer the hussar at that moment noticed the face of the rednosedcaptain and his drawnin stomach and mimicked his expression and posewith such exactitude that nesvitski could not help laughing kutuzovturned round the officer evidently had complete control of his faceand while kutuzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assumea most serious deferential and innocent expressionthe third company was the last and kutuzov pondered apparently tryingto recollect something prince andrew stepped forward from among thesuite and said in frenchyou told me to remind you of the officer dolokhov reduced to the ranksin this regimentwhere is dolokhov asked kutuzovdolokhov who had already changed into a soldiers gray greatcoat didnot wait to be called the shapely figure of the fairhaired soldierwith his clear blue eyes stepped forward from the ranks went up to thecommander in chief and presented armshave you a complaint to make kutuzov asked with a slight frownthis is dolokhov said prince andrewah said kutuzov i hope this will be a lesson to you do your dutythe emperor is gracious and i shant forget you if you deserve wellthe clear blue eyes looked at the commanderinchief just as boldly asthey had looked at the regimental commander seeming by their expressionto tear open the veil of convention that separates a commanderinchiefso widely from a privateone thing i ask of your excellency dolokhov said in his firmringing deliberate voice i ask an opportunity to atone for my faultand prove my devotion to his majesty the emperor and to russiakutuzov turned away the same smile of the eyes with which he had turnedfrom captain timokhin again flitted over his face he turned away with agrimace as if to say that everything dolokhov had said to him andeverything he could say had long been known to him that he was weary ofit and it was not at all what he wanted he turned away and went to thecarriagethe regiment broke up into companies which went to their appointedquarters near braunau where they hoped to receive boots and clothes andto rest after their hard marchesyou wont bear me a grudge prokhor ignatych said the regimentalcommander overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters andriding up to captain timokhin who was walking in front the regimentalcommanders face now that the inspection was happily over beamed withirrepressible delight its in the emperors service it cant behelped one is sometimes a bit hasty on parade i am the first toapologize you know me he was very pleased and he held out hishand to the captaindont mention it general as if id be so bold replied the captainhis nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two frontteeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun atismailand tell mr dolokhov that i wont forget himhe may be quite easyand tell me pleaseive been meaning to askhow is he behavinghimself and in generalas far as the service goes he is quite punctilious your excellencybut his character said timokhinand what about his character asked the regimental commanderits different on different days answered the captain one day he issensible well educated and goodnatured and the next hes a wildbeast in poland if you please he nearly killed a jewoh well well remarked the regimental commander still one musthave pity on a young man in misfortune you know he has importantconnections well then you justi will your excellency said timokhin showing by his smile that heunderstood his commanders wishwell of course of coursethe regimental commander sought out dolokhov in the ranks and reiningin his horse said to himafter the next affair epaulettesdolokhov looked round but did not say anything nor did the mockingsmile on his lips changewell thats all right continued the regimental commander a cup ofvodka for the men from me he added so that the soldiers could hear ithank you all god be praised and he rode past that company andovertook the next onewell hes really a good fellow one can serve under him saidtimokhin to the subaltern beside himin a word a hearty one said the subaltern laughing theregimental commander was nicknamed king of heartsthe cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected thesoldiers the

when those germans gave us lifts you just sit still andare drawn alongand here friend the people are quite beggarly there they all seemedto be polesall under the russian crownbut here theyre all regulargermanssingers to the front came the captains orderand from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front adrummer their leader turned round facing the singers and flourishinghis arm began a longdrawnout soldiers song commencing with thewords morning dawned the sun was rising and concluding on thenbrothers on to glory led by father kamenski this song had beencomposed in the turkish campaign and now being sung in austria the onlychange being that the words father kamenski were replaced by fatherkutuzovhaving jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms asif flinging something to the ground the drummera lean handsomesoldier of fortylooked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyesthen having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him he raisedboth arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious objectabove his head and holding it there for some seconds suddenly flung itdown and beganoh my bower oh my boweroh my bower new chimed in twenty voices and the castanet playerin spite of the burden of his equipment rushed out to the front andwalking backwards before the company jerked his shoulders andflourished his castanets as if threatening someone the soldiersswinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously marched with longsteps behind the company the sound of wheels the creaking of springsand the tramp of horses hoofs were heard kutuzov and his suite werereturning to the town the commanderinchief made a sign that the menshould continue to march at ease and he and all his suite showedpleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancingsoldier and the gay and smartly marching men in the second file fromthe right flank beside which the carriage passed the company a blueeyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice it was dolokhov marchingwith particular grace and boldness in time to the song and looking atthose driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that momentmarching with the company the hussar cornet of kutuzovs suite who hadmimicked the regimental commander fell back from the carriage and rodeup to dolokhovhussar cornet zherkov had at one time in petersburg belonged to thewild set led by dolokhov zherkov had met dolokhov abroad as a privateand had not seen fit to recognize him but now that kutuzov had spokento the gentleman ranker he addressed him with the cordiality of an oldfriendmy dear fellow how are you said he through the singing making hishorse keep pace with the companyhow am i dolokhov answered coldly i am as you seethe lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easygaiety with which zherkov spoke and to the intentional coldness ofdolokhovs replyand how do you get on with the officers inquired zherkovall right they are good fellows and how have you wriggled onto thestaffi was attached im on dutyboth were silentshe let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve went the songarousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness theirconversation would probably have been different but for the effect ofthat songis it true that austrians have been beaten asked dolokhovthe devil only knows they say soim glad answered dolokhov briefly and clearly as the song demandedi say come round some evening and well have a game of faro saidzherkovwhy have you too much moneydo comei cant ive sworn not to i wont drink and wont play till i getreinstatedwell thats only till the first engagementwe shall seethey were again silentcome if you need anything one can at least be of use on the staffdolokhov smiled dont trouble if i want anything i wont begilltake itwell never mind i onlyand i onlygoodbyegood healthits a long long way to my native landzherkov touched his horse with the spurs it pranced excitedly from footto foot uncertain with which to start then settled down galloped pastthe company and overtook the carriage still keeping time to the songon returning from the review kutuzov took the austrian general into hisprivate room and calling his adjutant asked for some papers relatingto the condition of the troops on their arrival and the letters thathad come from the archduke ferdinand who was in command of the advancedarmy prince andrew bolkonski came into the room with the requiredpapers kutuzov and the austrian member of the hofkriegsrath weresitting at the table on which a plan was spread outah said kutuzov glancing at bolkonski as if by this exclamation hewas asking the adjutant to wait and he went on with the conversation infrenchall i can say general said he with a pleasant elegance of expressionand intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spokenword it was evident that kutuzov himself listened with pleasure to hisown voice all i can say general is that if the matter depended on mypersonal wishes the will of his majesty the emperor francis would havebeen fulfilled long ago i should long ago have joined the archduke andbelieve me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure tohand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a betterinformed and more skillful generalof whom austria has so manyand tolay down all this heavy responsibility but circumstances are sometimestoo strong for us generaland kutuzov smiled in a way that seemed to say you are quite atliberty not to believe me and i dont even care whether you do or notbut you have no grounds for telling me so and that is the whole pointthe austrian general looked dissatisfied but had no option but to replyin the same toneon the contrary he said in a querulous and angry tone thatcontrasted with his flattering words on the contrary yourexcellencys participation in the common action is highly valued by hismajesty but we think the present delay is depriving the splendidrussian troops and their commander of the laurels they have beenaccustomed to win in their battles he concluded his evidentlyprearranged sentencekutuzov bowed with the same smilebut that is my conviction and judging by the last letter with whichhis highness the archduke ferdinand has honored me i imagine that theaustrian troops under the direction of so skillful a leader as generalmack have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer needour aid said kutuzovthe general frowned though there was no definite news of an austriandefeat there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumorsthat were afloat and so kutuzovs suggestion of an austrian victorysounded much like irony but kutuzov went on blandly smiling with thesame expression which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose soand in fact the last letter he had received from macks army informedhim of a victory and stated strategically the position of the army wasvery favorablegive me that letter said kutuzov turning to prince andrew pleasehave a look at itand kutuzov with an ironical smile about the cornersof his mouth read to the austrian general the following passage ingerman from the archduke ferdinands letterwe have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men withwhich to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the lech also aswe are masters of ulm we cannot be deprived of the advantage ofcommanding both sides of the danube so that should the enemy not crossthe lech we can cross the danube throw ourselves on his line ofcommunications recross the river lower down and frustrate hisintention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithfulally we shall therefore confidently await the moment when the imperialrussian army will be fully equipped and shall then in conjunction withit easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserveskutuzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at themember of the hofkriegsrath mildly and attentivelybut you know the wise maxim your excellency advising one to expect theworst said the austrian general evidently wishing to have done withjests and to come to business he involuntarily looked round at theaidedecampexcuse me general interrupted kutuzov also turning to princeandrew look here my dear fellow get from kozlovski all the reportsfrom our scouts here are two letters from count nostitz and here is onefrom his highness the archduke ferdinand and here are these he saidhanding him several papers make a neat memorandum in french out of allthis showing all the news we have had of the movements of the austrianarmy and then give it to his excellencyprince andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from thefirst not only what had been said but also what kutuzov would have likedto tell him he gathered up the papers and with a bow to both steppedsoftly over the carpet and went out into the waiting roomthough not much time had passed since prince andrew had left russia hehad changed greatly during that period in the expression of his facein his movements in his walk scarcely a trace was left of his formeraffected languor and indolence he now looked like a man who has time tothink of the impression he makes on others but is occupied withagreeable and interesting work his face expressed more satisfactionwith himself and those around him his smile and glance were brighterand more attractivekutuzov whom he had overtaken in poland had received him very kindlypromised not to forget him distinguished him above the other adjutantsand had taken him to vienna and given him the more serious commissionsfrom vienna kutuzov wrote to his old comrade prince andrews fatheryour son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industryfirmness and expedition i consider myself fortunate to have such asubordinate by meon kutuzovs staff among his fellow officers and in the army generallyprince andrew had as he had had in petersburg society two quiteopposite reputations some a minority acknowledged him to be differentfrom themselves and from everyone else expected great things of himlistened to him admired and imitated him and with them prince andrewwas natural and pleasant others the majority disliked him andconsidered him conceited cold and disagreeable but among these peopleprince andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and evenfeared himcoming out of kutuzovs room into the waiting room with the papers inhis hand prince andrew came up to his comrade the aidedecamp on dutykozlovski who was sitting at the window with a bookwell prince asked kozlovskii am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are notadvancingand why is itprince andrew shrugged his shouldersany news from macknoif it were true that he has been beaten news would have comeprobably said prince andrew moving toward the outer doorbut at that instant a tall austrian general in a greatcoat with theorder of maria theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his headwho had evidently just arrived entered quickly slamming the doorprince andrew stopped shortcommander in chief kutuzov said the newly arrived general speakingquickly with a harsh german accent looking to both sides and advancingstraight toward the inner doorthe commanderinchief is engaged said kozlovski going hurriedly upto the unknown general and blocking his way to the door whom shall iannouncethe unknown general looked disdainfully down at kozlovski who wasrather short as if surprised that anyone should not know himthe commanderinchief is engaged repeated kozlovski calmlythe generals face clouded his lips quivered and trembled he took outa notebook hurriedly scribbled something in pencil tore out the leafgave it to kozlovski stepped quickly to the window and threw himselfinto a chair gazing at those in the room as if asking why do theylook at me then he lifted his head stretched his neck as if heintended to say something but immediately with affected indifferencebegan to hum to himself producing a queer sound which immediately brokeoff the door of the private room opened and kutuzov appeared in thedoorway the general with the bandaged head bent forward as thoughrunning away from some danger and making long quick strides with histhin legs went up to kutuzovvous voyez le malheureux mack he uttered in a broken voicekutuzovs face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectlyimmobile for a few moments then wrinkles ran over his face like a waveand his forehead became smooth again he bowed his head respectfullyclosed his eyes silently let mack enter his room before him and closedthe door himself behind himthe report which had been circulated that the austrians had been beatenand that the whole army had surrendered at ulm proved to be correctwithin half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions withorders which showed that the russian troops who had hitherto beeninactive would also soon have to meet the enemyprince andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interestlay in the general progress of the war when he saw mack and heard thedetails of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lostunderstood all the difficulties of the russian armys position andvividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to playinvoluntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of thehumiliation of arrogant austria and that in a weeks time he mightperhaps see and take part in the first russian encounter with thefrench since suvorov met them he feared that bonapartes genius mightoutweigh all the courage of the russian troops and at the same timecould not admit the idea of his hero being disgracedexcited and irritated by these thoughts prince andrew went toward hisroom to write to his father to whom he wrote every day in the corridorhe met nesvitski with whom he shared a room and the wag zherkov theywere as usual laughingwhy are you so glum asked nesvitski noticing prince andrews paleface and glittering eyestheres nothing to be gay about answered bolkonskijust as prince andrew met nesvitski and zherkov there came toward themfrom the other end of the corridor strauch an austrian general who onkutuzovs staff in charge of the provisioning of the russian army andthe member of the hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous eveningthere was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass thethree officers quite easily but zherkov pushing nesvitski aside withhis arm said in a breathless voicetheyre coming theyre coming stand aside make way pleasemake waythe generals were passing by looking as if they wished to avoidembarrassing attentions on the face of the wag zherkov there suddenlyappeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppressyour excellency said he in german stepping forward and addressingthe austrian general i have the honor to congratulate youhe bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with theother awkwardly like a child at a dancing lessonthe member of the hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but seeing theseriousness of his stupid smile could not but give him a momentsattention he screwed up his eyes showing that he was listeningi have the honor to congratulate you general mack has arrived quitewell only a little bruised just here he added pointing with abeaming smile to his headthe general frowned turned away and went ongott wie naiv  said he angrily after he had gone a few steps good god what simplicitynesvitski with a laugh threw his arms round prince andrew butbolkonski turning still paler pushed him away with an angry look andturned to zherkov the nervous irritation aroused by the appearance ofmack the news of his defeat and the thought of what lay before therussian army found vent in anger at zherkovs untimely jestif you sir choose to make a buffoon of yourself he said sharplywith a slight trembling of the lower jaw i cant prevent your doingso but i warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my presence iwill teach you to behave yourselfnesvitski and zherkov were so surprised by this outburst that they gazedat bolkonski silently with wideopen eyeswhats the matter i only congratulated them said zherkovi am not jesting with you please be silent cried bolkonski andtaking nesvitskis arm he left zherkov who did not know what to saycome whats the matter old fellow said nesvitski trying to soothehimwhats the matter exclaimed prince andrew standing still in hisexcitement dont you understand that either we are officers servingour tsar and our country rejoicing in the successes and grieving at themisfortunes of our common cause or we are merely lackeys who carenothing for their masters business quarante mille hommes massacres etlarmee de nos allies detruite et vous trouvez la le mot pour rire he said as if strengthening his views by this french sentence cestbien pour un garcon de rien comme cet individu dont vous avez fait unami mais pas pour vous pas pour vous  only a hobbledehoy couldamuse himself in this way he added in russianbut pronouncing theword with a french accenthaving noticed that zherkov could still hearhim forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies destroyedand you find that a cause for jesting  it is all very well for that goodfornothing fellow of whom youhave made a friend but not for you not for youhe waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer but he turnedand went out of the corridorthe pavlograd hussars were stationed two miles from braunau thesquadron in which nicholas rostov served as a cadet was quartered in thegerman village of salzeneck the best quarters in the village wereassigned to cavalrycaptain denisov the squadron

andholding up his saber his spurs jingling he ran up the steps of theporch his landlord who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap pitchfork inhand was clearing manure from the cowhouse looked out and his faceimmediately brightened on seeing rostov schon gut morgen schon gutmorgen  he said winking with a merry smile evidently pleased togreet the young man a very good morning a very good morningschon fleissig  said rostov with the same gay brotherly smile whichdid not leave his eager face hoch oestreicher hoch russen kaiseralexander hoch  said he quoting words often repeated by thegerman landlord

with his platoon from foraging for hay had anyreason for rejoicing they looked at each other with joyful delight andbrotherly love wagged their heads in token of their mutual affectionand parted smiling the german returning to his cowshed and rostov goingto the cottage he occupied with denisovwhat about your master he asked lavrushka denisovs orderly whomall the regiment knew for a roguehasnt

russian officer in theroom no one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knivesand the munching of the lieutenantwhen telyanin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a doublepurse and drawing its rings aside with his small white turnedupfingers drew out a gold imperial and lifting his eyebrows gave it tothe waiterplease be quick he saidthe coin was a new one rostov

above telyanins earwhat what how dare you what said telyaninbut these words came like a piteous despairing cry and an entreaty forpardon as soon as rostov heard them an enormous load of doubt fellfrom

telyanintaking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room we must have anexplanationi know it and shall prove it said rostovievery muscle of telyanins pale terrified face began to quiver hiseyes

eyes how could you do itcount said telyanin drawing nearer to himdont touch me said rostov drawing back if you need it take themoney and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the innthat same

and traun near linz on october  therussian troops were crossing the river enns at midday the russianbaggage train the artillery and columns of troops were defilingthrough the town of enns on both sides of the bridgeit was a warm rainy autumnal day the wide expanse that opened outbefore the heights on which the russian batteries stood guarding thebridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain andthen suddenly spread out in the sunlight fardistant objects could beclearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished down below thelittle town could be seen with its white redroofed houses itscathedral and its bridge on both sides of which streamed jostlingmasses of russian troops at the bend of the danube vessels an islandand a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence ofthe enns and the danube became visible and the rocky left bank of thedanube covered with pine forests with a mystic background of greentreetops and bluish gorges the turrets of a convent stood out beyond awild virgin pine forest and far away on the other side of the enns theenemys horse patrols could be discernedamong the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command ofthe rearguard stood with a staff officer scanning the country throughhis fieldglass a little behind them nesvitski who had been sent to therearguard by the commanderinchief was sitting on the trail of a guncarriage a cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and aflask and nesvitski was treating some officers to pies and realdoppelkummel the officers gladly gathered round him some on theirknees some squatting turkish fashion on the wet grassyes the austrian prince who built that castle was no fool its a fineplace why are you not eating anything gentlemen nesvitski wassayingthank you very much prince answered one of the officers pleased tobe talking to a staff officer of such importance its a lovely placewe passed close to the park and saw two deer and what a splendidhouselook prince said another who would have dearly liked to takeanother pie but felt shy and therefore pretended to be examining thecountrysidesee our infantrymen have already got there look there inthe meadow behind the village three of them are dragging somethingtheyll ransack that castle he remarked with evident approvalso they will said nesvitski no but what i should like added hemunching a pie in his moistlipped handsome mouth would be to slip inover therehe pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery and his eyes narrowed andgleamedthat would be fine gentlementhe officers laughedjust to flutter the nuns a bit they say there are italian girls amongthem on my word id give five years of my life for itthey must be feeling dull too said one of the bolder officerslaughingmeanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something tothe general who looked through his field glassyes so it is so it is said the general angrily lowering the fieldglass and shrugging his shoulders so it is theyll be fired on at thecrossing and why are they dawdling thereon the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye and fromtheir battery a milkwhite cloud arose then came the distant report ofa shot and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossingnesvitski rose puffing and went up to the general smilingwould not your excellency like a little refreshment he saidits a bad business said the general without answering him our menhave been wasting timehadnt i better ride over your excellency asked nesvitskiyes please do answered the general and he repeated the order thathad already once been given in detail and tell the hussars that theyare to cross last and to fire the bridge as i ordered and theinflammable material on the bridge must be reinspectedvery good answered nesvitskihe called the cossack with his horse told him to put away the knapsackand flask and swung his heavy person easily into the saddleill really call in on the nuns he said to the officers who watchedhim smilingly and he rode off by the winding path down the hillnow then lets see how far it will carry captain just try said thegeneral turning to an artillery officer have a little fun to pass thetimecrew to your guns commanded the officerin a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and beganloadingone came the commandnumber one jumped briskly aside the gun rang out with a deafeningmetallic roar and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of ourtroops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy a little smokeshowing the spot where it burstthe faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound everyone gotup and began watching the movements of our troops below as plainlyvisible as if but a stones throw away and the movements of theapproaching enemy farther off at the same instant the sun came fullyout from behind the clouds and the clear sound of the solitary shot andthe brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous andspirited impressiontwo of the enemys shots had already flown across the bridge wherethere was a crush halfway across stood prince nesvitski who hadalighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against therailings he looked back laughing to the cossack who stood a few stepsbehind him holding two horses by their bridles each time princenesvitski tried to move on soldiers and carts pushed him back again andpressed him against the railings and all he could do was to smilewhat a fine fellow you are friend said the cossack to a convoysoldier with a wagon who was pressing onto the infantrymen who werecrowded together close to his wheels and his horses what a fellow youcant wait a moment dont you see the general wants to passbut the convoyman took no notice of the word general and shouted atthe soldiers who were blocking his way hi there boys keep to theleft wait a bit but the soldiers crowded together shoulder toshoulder their bayonets interlocking moved over the bridge in a densemass looking down over the rails prince nesvitski saw the rapid noisylittle waves of the enns which rippling and eddying round the piles ofthe bridge chased each other along looking on the bridge he saw equallyuniform living waves of soldiers shoulder straps covered shakosknapsacks bayonets long muskets and under the shakos faces withbroad cheekbones sunken cheeks and listless tired expressions andfeet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of thebridge sometimes through the monotonous waves of men like a fleck ofwhite foam on the waves of the enns an officer in a cloak and with atype of face different from that of the men squeezed his way alongsometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river an hussar on footan orderly or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry andsometimes like a log floating down the river an officers or companysbaggage wagon piled high leather covered and hemmed in on all sidesmoved across the bridgeits as if a dam had burst said the cossack hopelessly are theremany more of you to comea million all but one replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat witha wink and passed on followed by another an old manif he he meant the enemy begins popping at the bridge now saidthe old soldier dismally to a comrade youll forget to scratchyourselfthat soldier passed on and after him came another sitting on a cartwhere the devil have the leg bands been shoved to said an orderlyrunning behind the cart and fumbling in the back of itand he also passed on with the wagon then came some merry soldiers whohad evidently been drinkingand then old fellow he gives him one in the teeth with the butt endof his gun a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gailywith a wide swing of his armyes the ham was just delicious answered another with a loud laughand they too passed on so that nesvitski did not learn who had beenstruck on the teeth or what the ham had to do with itbah how they scurry he just sends a ball and they think theyll allbe killed a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfullyas it flies past me daddy the ball i mean said a young soldier withan enormous mouth hardly refraining from laughing i felt like dyingof fright i did pon my word i got that frightened said he as ifbragging of having been frightenedthat one also passed then followed a cart unlike any that had gonebefore it was a german cart with a pair of horses led by a german andseemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects a fine brindled cow witha large udder was attached to the cart behind a woman with an unweanedbaby an old woman and a healthy german girl with bright red cheekswere sitting on some feather beds evidently these fugitives wereallowed to pass by special permission the eyes of all the soldiersturned toward the women and while the vehicle was passing at foot paceall the soldiers remarks related to the two young ones every face borealmost the same smile expressing unseemly thoughts about the womenjust see the german sausage is making tracks toosell me the missis said another soldier addressing the german whoangry and frightened strode energetically along with downcast eyessee how smart shes made herself oh the devilsthere fedotov you should be quartered on themi have seen as much before now matewhere are you going asked an infantry officer who was eating anapple also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girlthe german closed his eyes signifying that he did not understandtake it if you like said the officer giving the girl an applethe girl smiled and took it nesvitski like the rest of the men on thebridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed whenthey had gone by the same stream of soldiers followed with the samekind of talk and at last all stopped as often happens the horses of aconvoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge and the wholecrowd had to waitand why are they stopping theres no proper order said the soldierswhere are you shoving to devil take you cant you wait itll beworse if he fires the bridge see heres an officer jammed in toodifferent voices were saying in the crowd as the men looked at oneanother and all pressed toward the exit from the bridgelooking down at the waters of the enns under the bridge nesvitskisuddenly heard a sound new to him of something swiftly approachingsomething big that splashed into the waterjust see where it carries to a soldier near by said sternly lookinground at the soundencouraging us to get along quicker said another uneasilythe crowd moved on again nesvitski realized that it was a cannon ballhey cossack my horse he said now then you there get out of theway make waywith great difficulty he managed to get to his horse and shoutingcontinually he moved on the soldiers squeezed themselves to make wayfor him but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg and thosenearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed stillharder from behindnesvitski nesvitski you numskull came a hoarse voice from behindhimnesvitski looked round and saw some fifteen paces away but separated bythe living mass of moving infantry vaska denisov red and shaggy withhis cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily overhis shouldertell these devils these fiends to let me pass shouted denisovevidently in a fit of rage his coalblack eyes with their bloodshotwhites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a smallbare hand as red as his faceah vaska joyfully replied nesvitski whats up with youthe squadwon cant pass shouted vaska denisov showing his whiteteeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred arab which twitchedits ears as the bayonets touched it and snorted spurting white foamfrom his bit tramping the planks of the bridge with his hoofs andapparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let him whatis this theyre like sheep just like sheep out of the way let uspass stop there you devil with the cart ill hack you with mysaber he shouted actually drawing his saber from its scabbard andflourishing itthe soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces anddenisov joined nesvitskihows it youre not drunk today said nesvitski when the other hadridden up to himthey dont even give one time to dwink answered vaska denisov theykeep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day if they mean to fightlets fight but the devil knows what this iswhat a dandy you are today said nesvitski looking at denisovs newcloak and saddleclothdenisov smiled took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffuseda smell of perfume and put it to nesvitskis noseof course im going into action ive shaved bwushed my teeth andscented myselfthe imposing figure of nesvitski followed by his cossack and thedetermination of denisov who flourished his sword and shoutedfrantically had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through tothe farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry beside thebridge nesvitski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the orderand having done this he rode backhaving cleared the way denisov stopped at the end of the bridgecarelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing theground eager to rejoin its fellows he watched his squadron drawnearer then the clang of hoofs as of several horses gallopingresounded on the planks of the bridge and the squadron officers infront and men four abreast spread across the bridge and began to emergeon his side of itthe infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in thetrampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of illwillestrangement and ridicule with which troops of different arms usuallyencounter one another at the clean smart hussars who moved past them inregular ordersmart lads only fit for a fair said onewhat good are they theyre led about just for show remarked anotherdont kick up the dust you infantry jested an hussar whose prancinghorse had splashed mud over some foot soldiersid like to put you on a two days march with a knapsack your finecords would soon get a bit rubbed said an infantryman wiping the mudoff his face with his sleeve perched up there youre more like a birdthan a manthere now zikin they ought to put you on a horse youd look finesaid a corporal chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under theweight of his knapsacktake a stick between your legs thatll suit you for a horse thehussar shouted backthe last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge squeezingtogether as they approached it as if passing through a funnel at lastthe baggage wagons had all crossed the crush was less and the lastbattalion came onto the bridge only denisovs squadron of hussarsremained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy who couldbe seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible fromthe bridge for the horizon as seen from the valley through which theriver flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away atthe foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of ourcossack scouts were moving suddenly on the road at the top of the highground artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen these were thefrench a group of cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot allthe officers and men of denisovs squadron though they tried to talk ofother things and to look in other directions thought only of what wasthere on the hilltop and kept constantly looking at the patchesappearing on the skyline which they knew to be the enemys troops theweather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightlyupon the danube and the dark hills around it it was calm and atintervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heardfrom the hill there was no one now between the squadron and the enemyexcept a few scattered skirmishers an empty space of some seven hundredyards was all that separated them the enemy ceased firing and thatstern threatening inaccessible and intangible line which separatestwo hostile armies was all the more clearly feltone step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividingthe living from the dead lies uncertainty suffering and death andwhat is there who is therethere beyond that field that tree thatroof lit up by the sun no one knows but one wants to know you fearand yet long to cross that line and know that sooner or later it mustbe crossed and you will have to find out what is there just as you willinevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death but you arestrong healthy cheerful and excited and are surrounded by other suchexcitedly animated and healthy men so thinks or at any rate feelsanyone who comes in sight of the enemy and that feeling gives aparticular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything thattakes place at such momentson the high ground where the enemy was the smoke of a cannon rose anda ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron theofficers who had been standing together rode off to their places thehussars began carefully aligning their horses silence fell on the wholesquadron all were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadroncommander awaiting the word of command a second and a third cannonball flew past evidently they were firing at the hussars but the ballswith rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fellsomewhere beyond them the hussars did not look round but at the soundof each shot as at the word of command the whole squadron with itsrows of faces so alike yet so different holding its breath while theball flew past rose in the stirrups and sank back again the soldierswithout turning their heads glanced at one another curious to see theircomrades impression every face from denisovs to that of the buglershowed one common expression of conflict irritation and excitementaround chin and mouth the quartermaster frowned looking at thesoldiers as if threatening to punish them cadet mironov ducked everytime a ball flew past rostov on the left flank mounted on his rookahandsome horse despite its game leghad the happy air of a schoolboycalled up before a large audience for an examination in which he feelssure he will distinguish himself he was glancing at everyone with aclear bright expression as if asking them to notice how calmly he satunder fire but despite himself on his face too that same indication ofsomething new and stern showed round the mouthwhos that curtseying there cadet miwonov thats not wight look atme cried denisov who unable to keep still on one spot kept turninghis horse in front of the squadronthe black hairy snubnosed face of vaska denisov and his whole shortsturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which heheld the hilt of his naked saber looked just as it usually didespecially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle he wasonly redder than usual with his shaggy head thrown back like birds whenthey drink pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his goodhorse bedouin and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddlehe galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarsevoice to the men to look to their pistols he rode up to kirsten thestaff captain on his broadbacked steady mare came at a walk to meethim his face with its long mustache was serious as always only hiseyes were brighter than usualwell what about it said he to denisov it wont come to a fightyoull seewe shall retirethe devil only knows what theyre about muttered denisov ahwostov he cried noticing the cadets bright face youve got it atlastand he smiled approvingly evidently pleased with the cadet rostov feltperfectly happy just then the commander appeared on the bridge denisovgalloped up to himyour excellency let us attack them ill dwive them offattack indeed said the colonel in a bored voice puckering up hisface as if driving off a troublesome fly and why are you stoppinghere dont you see the skirmishers are retreating lead the squadronbackthe squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire withouthaving lost a single man the second squadron that had been in the frontline followed them across and the last cossacks quitted the farther sideof the riverthe two pavlograd squadrons having crossed the bridge retired up thehill one after the other their colonel karl bogdanich schubert cameup to denisovs squadron and rode at a footpace not far from rostovwithout taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for thefirst time since their encounter concerning telyanin rostov feelingthat he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he nowadmitted that he had been to blame did not lift his eyes from thecolonels athletic back his nape covered with light hair and his redneck it seemed to rostov that bogdanich was only pretending not tonotice him and that his whole aim now was to test the cadets courageso he drew himself up and looked around him merrily then it seemed tohim that bogdanich rode so near in order to show him his courage nexthe thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attackjust to punish himrostov then he imagined how after the attackbogdanich would come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimouslyextend the hand of reconciliationthe highshouldered figure of zherkov familiar to the pavlograds as hehad but recently left their regiment rode up to the colonel after hisdismissal from headquarters zherkov had not remained in the regimentsaying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he could getmore rewards by doing nothing on the staff and had succeeded inattaching himself as an orderly officer to prince bagration he now cameto his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear guardcolonel he said addressing rostovs enemy with an air of gloomygravity and glancing round at his comrades there is an order to stopand fire the bridgean order to who asked the colonel moroselyi dont myself know to who replied the cornet in a serious tonebut the prince told me to go and tell the colonel that the hussarsmust return quickly and fire the bridgezherkov was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to thecolonel of hussars with the same order after him the stout nesvitskicame galloping up on a cossack horse that could scarcely carry hisweighthows this colonel he shouted as he approached i told you to firethe bridge and now someone has gone and blundered they are all besidethemselves over there and one cant make anything outthe colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to nesvitskiyou spoke to me of inflammable material said he but you saidnothing about firing itbut my dear sir said nesvitski as he drew up taking off his cap andsmoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand wasnt itelling you to fire the bridge when inflammable material had been putin positioni am not your dear sir mr staff officer and you did not tell me toburn the bridge i know the service and it is my habit orders strictlyto obey you said the bridge would be burned but who would it burn icould not know by the holy spiritah thats always the way said nesvitski with a wave of the handhow did you get here said he turning to zherkovon the same business but you are damp let me wring you outyou were saying mr staff officer continued the colonel in anoffended tonecolonel interrupted the officer of the suite you must be quick orthe enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshotthe colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite at the stoutstaff officer and at zherkov and he frownedi will the bridge fire he said in a solemn tone as if to announcethat in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would stilldo the right thingstriking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blamefor everything the colonel moved forward and ordered the secondsquadron that in which rostov was serving under denisov to return tothe bridgethere its just as i thought said rostov to himself he wishes totest me his heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face lethim see whether i am a coward he thoughtagain on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expressionappeared that they had worn when under fire rostov watched his enemythe colonel closelyto find in his face confirmation of his ownconjecture but the colonel did not once glance at rostov and looked ashe always did when at the front solemn and stern then came the word ofcommandlook sharp look sharp several voices repeated around himtheir sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling thehussars hastily dismounted not knowing what they were to do the menwere crossing themselves rostov no longer looked at the colonel he hadno time he was afraid of falling behind the hussars so much afraidthat his heart stood still his hand trembled as he gave his horse intoan orderlys charge and he felt the blood rush to his heart with athud denisov rode past him leaning back and shouting something rostovsaw nothing but the hussars running all around him their spurs catchingand their sabers clatteringstretchers shouted someone behind himrostov did not think what this call for stretchers meant he ran ontrying only to be ahead of the others but just at the bridge notlooking at the ground he came on some sticky trodden mud stumbledand fell on his hands the others outstripped himat boss zides captain he heard the voice of the colonel who havingridden ahead had pulled up his horse near the bridge with atriumphant cheerful facerostov wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy andwas about to run on thinking that the farther he went to the front thebetter but bogdanich without looking at or recognizing rostov shoutedto himwhos that running on the middle of the bridge to the right comeback cadet he cried angrily and turning to denisov who showing offhis courage had ridden on to the planks of the bridgewhy run risks captain you should dismount he saidoh every bullet has its billet answered vaska denisov turning inhis saddlemeanwhile nesvitski zherkov and the officer of the suite were standingtogether out of range of the shots watching now the small group of menwith yellow shakos darkgreen jackets braided with cord and blueriding breeches who were swarming near the bridge and then at what wasapproaching in the distance from the opposite sidethe blue uniformsand groups with horses easily recognizable as artillerywill they burn the bridge or not wholl get there first will they getthere and fire the bridge or will the french get within grapeshot rangeand wipe them out these were the questions each man of the troops onthe high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with asinking heartwatching the bridge and the hussars in the bright eveninglight and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with theirbayonets and gunsugh the hussars will get it hot said nesvitski they are withingrapeshot range nowhe shouldnt have taken so many men said the officer of the suitetrue enough answered nesvitski two smart fellows could have donethe job just as wellah your excellency put in zherkov his eyes fixed on the hussarsbut still with that naive air that made it impossible to know whether hewas speaking in jest or in earnest ah your excellency how you lookat things send two men and who then would give us the vladimir medaland ribbon but now even if they do get peppered the squadron may berecommended for honors and he may get a ribbon our bogdanich knows howthings are donethere now said the officer of the suite thats grapeshothe pointed to the french guns the limbers of which were being detachedand hurriedly removedon the french side amid the groups with cannon a cloud of smokeappeared then a second and a third almost simultaneously and at themoment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen then tworeports one after another and a thirdoh oh groaned nesvitski as if in fierce pain seizing the officer ofthe suite by the arm look a man has fallen fallen fallentwo i thinkif i were tsar i would never go to war said nesvitski turning awaythe french guns were hastily reloaded the infantry in their blueuniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run smoke appeared again butat irregular intervals and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto thebridge but this time nesvitski could not see what was happening thereas a dense cloud of smoke arose from it the hussars had succeeded insetting it on fire and the french batteries were now firing at them nolonger to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there wassomeone to fire atthe french had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussarsgot back to their horses two were misdirected and the shot went toohigh but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars andknocked three of them overrostov absorbed by his relations with bogdanich had paused on thebridge not knowing what to do there was no one to hew down as he hadalways imagined battles to himself nor could he help to fire thebridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like theother soldiers he stood looking about him when suddenly he heard arattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt and the hussar nearestto him fell against the rails with a groan rostov ran up to him withthe others again someone shouted stretchers four men seized thehussar and began lifting himoooh for christs sake let me alone cried the wounded man but stillhe was lifted and laid on the stretchernicholas rostov turned away and as if searching for something gazedinto the distance at the waters of the danube at the sky and at thesun how beautiful the sky looked how blue how calm and how deep howbright and glorious was the setting sun with what soft glitter thewaters of the distant danube shone and fairer still were the farawayblue mountains beyond the river the nunnery the mysterious gorges andthe pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits there was peaceand happiness i should wish for nothing else nothing if only iwere there thought rostov in myself alone and in that sunshine thereis so much happiness but here groans suffering fear and thisuncertainty and hurry therethey are shouting again and again areall running back somewhere and i shall run with them and it death ishere above me and around another instant and i shall never again seethe sun this water that gorgeat that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds and otherstretchers came into view before rostov and the fear of death and ofthe stretchers and love of the sun and of life all merged into onefeeling of sickening agitationo lord god thou who art in that heaven save forgive and protectme rostov whisperedthe hussars ran back to the men who held their horses their voicessounded louder and calmer the stretchers disappeared from sightwell fwiend so youve smelt powdah shouted vaska denisov just abovehis earits all over but i am a cowardyes a coward thought rostov andsighing deeply he took rook his horse which stood resting one footfrom the orderly and began to mountwas that grapeshot he asked denisovyes and no mistake cried denisov you worked like wegular bwicks andits nasty work an attacks pleasant work hacking away at the dogsbut this sort of thing is the very devil with them shooting at you likea targetand denisov rode up to a group that had stopped near rostov composed ofthe colonel nesvitski zherkov and the officer from the suitewell it seems that no one has noticed thought rostov and this wastrue no one had taken any notice for everyone knew the sensation whichthe cadet under fire for the first time had experiencedheres something for you to report said zherkov see if i dont getpromoted to a sublieutenancyinform the prince that i the bridge fired said the coloneltriumphantly and gailyand if he asks about the lossesa trifle said the colonel in his bass voice two hussars woundedand one knocked out he added unable to restrain a happy smile andpronouncing the phrase knocked out with ringing distinctnesspursued by the french army of a hundred thousand men under the commandof bonaparte encountering a population that was unfriendly to itlosing confidence in its allies suffering from shortness of suppliesand compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that hadbeen foreseen the russian army of thirtyfive thousand men commanded bykutuzov was hurriedly retreating along the danube stopping whereovertaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far asnecessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipmentthere had been actions at lambach amstetten and melk but despite thecourage and enduranceacknowledged even by the enemywith which therussians fought the only consequence of these actions was a yet morerapid retreat austrian troops that had escaped capture at ulm and hadjoined kutuzov at braunau now separated from the russian army andkutuzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces thedefense of vienna was no longer to be thought of instead of anoffensive the plan of which carefully prepared in accord with themodern science of strategics had been handed to kutuzov when he was invienna by the austrian hofkriegsrath the sole and almost unattainableaim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that wereadvancing from russia without losing his army as mack had done at ulmon the twentyeighth of october kutuzov with his army crossed to theleft bank of the danube and took up a position for the first time withthe river between himself and the main body of the french on thethirtieth he attacked mortiers division which was on the left bankand broke it up in this action for the first time trophies were takenbanners cannon and two enemy generals for the first time after afortnights retreat the russian troops had halted and after a fight hadnot only held the field but had repulsed the french though the troopswere illclad exhausted and had lost a third of their number inkilled wounded sick and stragglers though a number of sick andwounded had been abandoned on the other side of the danube with a letterin which kutuzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy and thoughthe big hospitals and the houses in krems converted into militaryhospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded yet thestand made at krems and the victory over mortier raised the spirits ofthe army considerably throughout the whole army and at headquartersmost joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approachof columns from russia of some victory gained by the austrians and ofthe retreat of the frightened bonaparteprince andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the austriangeneral schmidt who was killed in the action his horse had beenwounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet as a markof the commanderinchiefs special favor he was sent with the news ofthis victory to the austrian court now no longer at vienna which wasthreatened by the french but at brunn despite his apparently delicatebuild prince andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than manyvery muscular men and on the night of the battle having arrived atkrems excited but not weary with dispatches from dokhturov to kutuzovhe was sent immediately with a special dispatch to brunn to be so sentmeant not only a reward but an important step toward promotionthe night was dark but starry the road showed black in the snow thathad fallen the previous daythe day of the battle reviewing hisimpressions of the recent battle picturing pleasantly to himself theimpression his news of a victory would create or recalling the sendoffgiven him by the commanderinchief and his fellow officers princeandrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of aman who has at length begun to attain a longdesired happiness as soonas he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of thewheels and the sensation of victory then he began to imagine that therussians were running away and that he himself was killed but hequickly roused himself with a feeling of joy as if learning afresh thatthis was not so but that on the contrary the french had run away heagain recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courageduring the battle and feeling reassured he dozed off the darkstarry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning the snow wasthawing in the sunshine the horses galloped quickly and on both sidesof the road were forests of different kinds fields and villagesat one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of russian wounded therussian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the frontcart shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse in each of thelong german carts six or more pale dirty bandaged men were beingjolted over the stony road some of them were talking he heard russianwords others were eating bread the more severely wounded lookedsilently with the languid interest of sick children at the envoyhurrying past themprince andrew told his driver to stop and asked a soldier in whataction they had been wounded day before yesterday on the danubeanswered the soldier prince andrew took out his purse and gave thesoldier three gold piecesthats for them all he said to the officer who came upget well soon lads he continued turning to the soldiers theresplenty to do stillwhat news sir asked the officer evidently anxious to start aconversationgood news go on he shouted to the driver and they galloped onit was already quite dark when prince andrew rattled over the pavedstreets of brunn and found himself surrounded by high buildings thelights of shops houses and street lamps fine carriages and all thatatmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to asoldier after camp life despite his rapid journey and sleepless nightprince andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous andalert than he had done the day before only his eyes gleamed feverishlyand his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness andrapidity he again vividly recalled the details of the battle no longerdim but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himselfstating them to the emperor francis he vividly imagined the casualquestions that might be put to him and the answers he would give heexpected to be at once presented to the emperor at the chief entranceto the palace however an official came running out to meet him andlearning that he was a special messenger led him to another entranceto the right from the corridor euer hochgeboren there you will findthe adjutant on duty said the official he will conduct you to theminister of warthe adjutant on duty meeting prince andrew asked him to wait and wentin to the minister of war five minutes later he returned and bowingwith particular courtesy ushered prince andrew before him along acorridor to the cabinet where the minister of war was at work theadjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off anyattempt at familiarity on the part of the russian messengerprince andrews joyous feeling was considerably weakened as heapproached the door of the ministers room he felt offended andwithout his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned intoone of disdain which was quite uncalled for his fertile mind instantlysuggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise theadjutant and the minister away from the smell of powder they probablythink it easy to gain victories he thought his eyes narroweddisdainfully he entered the room of the minister of war with peculiarlydeliberate steps this feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw theminister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencilnotes on them and for the first two or three minutes taking no noticeof his arrival a wax candle stood at each side of the ministers bentbald head with its gray temples he went on reading to the end withoutraising his eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footstepstake this and deliver it said he to his adjutant handing him thepapers and still taking no notice of the special messengerprince andrew felt that either the actions of kutuzovs army interestedthe minister of war less than any of the other matters he was concernedwith or he wanted to give the russian special messenger thatimpression but that is a matter of perfect indifference to me hethought the minister drew the remaining papers together arranged themevenly and then raised his head he had an intellectual and distinctivehead but the instant he turned to prince andrew the firm intelligentexpression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate andhabitual to him his face took on the stupid artificial smile whichdoes not even attempt to hide its artificiality of a man who iscontinually receiving many petitioners one after anotherfrom general field marshal kutuzov he asked i hope it is good newsthere has been an encounter with mortier a victory it was high timehe took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read itwith a mournful expressionoh my god my god schmidt he exclaimed in german what a calamitywhat a calamityhaving glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and lookedat prince andrew evidently considering somethingah what a calamity you say the affair was decisive but mortier is notcaptured again he pondered i am very glad you have brought goodnews though schmidts death is a heavy price to pay for the victoryhis majesty will no doubt wish to see you but not today i thank youyou must have a rest be at the levee tomorrow after the paradehowever i will let you knowthe stupid smile which had left his face while he was speakingreappearedau revoir thank you very much his majesty will probably desire to seeyou he added bowing his headwhen prince andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest andhappiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in theindifferent hands of the minister of war and the polite adjutant thewhole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed the battle seemedthe memory of a remote event long pastprince andrew stayed at brunn with bilibin a russian acquaintance ofhis in the diplomatic serviceah my dear prince i could not have a more welcome visitor saidbilibin as he came out to meet prince andrew franz put the princesthings in my bedroom said he to the servant who was ushering bolkonskiin so youre a messenger of victory eh splendid and i am sittinghere ill as you seeafter washing and dressing prince andrew came into the diplomatsluxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him bilibinsettled down comfortably beside the fireafter his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived ofall the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life princeandrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings suchas he had been accustomed to from childhood besides it was pleasantafter his reception by the austrians to speak if not in russian forthey were speaking french at least with a russian who would hesupposed share the general russian antipathy to the austrians which wasthen particularly strongbilibin was a man of thirtyfive a bachelor and of the same circle asprince andrew they had known each other previously in petersburg buthad become more intimate when prince andrew was in vienna with kutuzovjust as prince andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high inthe military profession so to an even greater extent bilibin gavepromise of rising in his diplomatic career he still a young man but nolonger a young diplomat as he had entered the service at the age ofsixteen had been in paris and copenhagen and now held a ratherimportant post in vienna both the foreign minister and our ambassadorin vienna knew him and valued him he was not one of those manydiplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualitiesavoid doing certain things and speak french he was one of those wholiking work knew how to do it and despite his indolence wouldsometimes spend a whole night at his writing table he worked wellwhatever the import of his work it was not the question what for butthe question how that interested him what the diplomatic mattermight be he did not care but it gave him great pleasure to prepare acircular memorandum or report skillfully pointedly and elegantlybilibins services were valued not only for what he wrote but also forhis skill in dealing and conversing with those in the highest spheresbilibin liked conversation as he liked work only when it could be madeelegantly witty in society he always awaited an opportunity to saysomething striking and took part in a conversation only when that waspossible his conversation was always sprinkled with wittily originalfinished phrases of general interest these sayings were prepared in theinner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally sothat insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room todrawing room and in fact bilibins witticisms were hawked about inthe viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on mattersconsidered importanthis thin worn sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles which alwayslooked as clean and well washed as the tips of ones fingers after arussian bath the movement of these wrinkles formed the principal playof expression on his face now his forehead would pucker into deep foldsand his eyebrows were lifted then his eyebrows would descend and deepwrinkles would crease his cheeks his small deepset eyes alwaystwinkled and looked out straightwell now tell me about your exploits said hebolkonski very modestly without once mentioning himself described theengagement and his reception by the minister of warthey received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game ofskittles said he in conclusionbilibin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappearedcependant mon cher he remarked examining his nails from a distanceand puckering the skin above his left eye malgre la haute estime queje professe pour the orthodox russian army javoue que votre victoirenest pas des plus victorieuses  but my dear fellow with all my respect for the orthodox russianarmy i must say that your victory was not particularly victorioushe went on talking in this way in french uttering only those words inrussian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasiscome now you with all your forces fall on the unfortunate mortier andhis one division and even then mortier slips through your fingerswheres the victorybut seriously said prince andrew we can at any rate say withoutboasting that it was a little better than at ulmwhy didnt you capture one just one marshal for usbecause not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness ofa parade we had expected as i told you to get at their rear by sevenin the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoonand why didnt you do it at seven in the morning you ought to havebeen there at seven in the morning returned bilibin with a smile youought to have been there at seven in the morningwhy did you not succeed in impressing on bonaparte by diplomaticmethods that he had better leave genoa alone retorted prince andrew inthe same tonei know interrupted bilibin youre thinking its very easy to takemarshals sitting on a sofa by the fire that is true but still whydidnt you capture him so dont be surprised if not only the ministerof war but also his most august majesty the emperor and king francis isnot much delighted by your victory even i a poor secretary of therussian embassy do not feel any need in token of my joy to give myfranz a thaler or let him go with his liebchen to the prater truewe have no prater herehe looked straight at prince andrew and suddenly unwrinkled hisforeheadit is now my turn to ask you why mon cher said bolkonski iconfess i do not understand perhaps there are diplomatic subtletieshere beyond my feeble intelligence but i cant make it out mack losesa whole army the archduke ferdinand and the archduke karl give no signsof life and make blunder after blunder kutuzov alone at last gains areal victory destroying the spell of the invincibility of the frenchand the minister of war does not even care to hear the detailsthats just it my dear fellow you see its hurrah for the tsar forrussia for the orthodox greek faith all that is beautiful but what dowe i mean the austrian court care for your victories bring us nicenews of a victory by the archduke karl or ferdinand one archdukes asgood as another as you know and even if it is only over a fire brigadeof bonapartes that will be another story and well fire off somecannon but this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us thearchduke karl does nothing the archduke ferdinand disgraces himselfyou abandon vienna give up its defenseas much as to say heaven iswith us but heaven help you and your capital the one general whom weall loved schmidt you expose to a bullet and then you congratulate uson the victory admit that more irritating news than yours could nothave been conceived its as if it had been done on purpose on purposebesides suppose you did gain a brilliant victory if even the archdukekarl gained a victory what effect would that have on the general courseof events its too late now when vienna is occupied by the frencharmywhat occupied vienna occupiednot only occupied but bonaparte is at schonbrunn and the count ourdear count vrbna goes to him for ordersafter the fatigues and impressions of the journey his reception andespecially after having dined bolkonski felt that he could not take inthe full significance of the words he heardcount lichtenfels was here this morning bilibin continued andshowed me a letter in which the parade of the french in vienna was fullydescribed prince murat et tout le tremblement you see that yourvictory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you cant bereceived as a saviorreally i dont care about that i dont care at all said princeandrew beginning to understand that his news of the battle before kremswas really of small importance in view of such events as the fall ofaustrias capital how is it vienna was taken what of the bridge andits celebrated bridgehead and prince auersperg we heard reports thatprince auersperg was defending vienna he saidprince auersperg is on this on our side of the river and is defendingusdoing it very badly i think but still he is defending us butvienna is on the other side no the bridge has not yet been taken and ihope it will not be for it is mined and orders have been given to blowit up otherwise we should long ago have been in the mountains ofbohemia and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hourbetween two firesbut still this does not mean that the campaign is over said princeandrewwell i think it is the bigwigs here think so too but they darentsay so it will be as i said at the beginning of the campaign it wontbe your skirmishing at durrenstein or gunpowder at all that willdecide the matter but those who devised it said bilibin quoting oneof his own mots releasing the wrinkles on his forehead and pausingthe only question is what will come of the meeting between the emperoralexander and the king of prussia in berlin if prussia joins theallies austrias hand will be forced and there will be war if not itis merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of the newcampo formio are to be drawn upwhat an extraordinary genius prince andrew suddenly exclaimedclenching his small hand and striking the table with it and what luckthe man hasbuonaparte said bilibin inquiringly puckering up his forehead toindicate that he was about to say something witty buonaparte herepeated accentuating the u i think however now that he lays downlaws for austria at schonbrunn il faut lui faire grace de lu  ishall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply bonaparte we must let him off the ubut joking apart said prince andrew do you really think thecampaign is overthis is what i think austria has been made a fool of and she is notused to it she will retaliate and she has been fooled in the firstplace because her provinces have been pillagedthey say the holyrussian army loots terriblyher army is destroyed her capital takenand all this for the beaux yeux  of his sardinian majesty andthereforethis is between ourselvesi instinctively feel that we arebeing deceived my instinct tells me of negotiations with france andprojects for peace a secret peace concluded separately fine eyesimpossible cried prince andrew that would be too baseif we live we shall see replied bilibin his face again becomingsmooth as a sign that the conversation was at an endwhen prince andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in aclean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows hefelt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far far awayfrom him the alliance with prussia austrias treachery bonapartesnew triumph tomorrows levee and parade and the audience with theemperor francis occupied his thoughtshe closed his eyes and immediately a sound of cannonading of musketryand the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears and nowagain drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hillthe french were firing and he felt his heart palpitating as he rodeforward beside schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all aroundand he experienced tenfold the joy of living as he had not done sincechildhoodhe woke upyes that all happened he said and smiling happily to himself likea child he fell into a deep youthful slumbernext day he woke late recalling his recent impressions the firstthought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented tothe emperor francis he remembered the minister of war the politeaustrian adjutant bilibin and last nights conversation havingdressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform which he hadnot worn for a long time he went into bilibins study fresh animatedand handsome with his hand bandaged in the study were four gentlemenof the diplomatic corps with prince hippolyte kuragin who was asecretary to the embassy bolkonski was already acquainted bilibinintroduced him to the othersthe gentlemen assembled at bilibins were young wealthy gay societymen who here as in vienna formed a special set which bilibin theirleader called les notres  this set consisting almost exclusively ofdiplomats evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do withwar or politics but related to high society to certain women and tothe official side of the service these gentlemen received prince andrewas one of themselves an honor they did not extend to many frompoliteness and to start conversation they asked him a few questionsabout the army and the battle and then the talk went off into merryjests and gossip oursbut the best of it was said one telling of the misfortune of afellow diplomat that the chancellor told him flatly that hisappointment to london was a promotion and that he was so to regard itcan you fancy the figure he cutbut the worst of it gentlemeni am giving kuragin away to youisthat that man suffers and this don juan wicked fellow is takingadvantage of itprince hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over itsarm he began to laughtell me about that he saidoh you don juan you serpent cried several voicesyou bolkonski dont know said bilibin turning to prince andrewthat all the atrocities of the french army i nearly said of therussian army are nothing compared to what this man has been doing amongthe womenla femme est la compagne de lhomme  announced prince hippolyte andbegan looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs woman is mans companionbilibin and the rest of ours burst out laughing in hippolytes faceand prince andrew saw that hippolyte of whomhe had to admithe hadalmost been jealous on his wifes account was the butt of this setoh i must give you a treat bilibin whispered to bolkonski kuraginis exquisite when he discusses politicsyou should see his gravityhe sat down beside hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking tohim about politics prince andrew and the others gathered round thesetwothe berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance beganhippolyte gazing round with importance at the others withoutexpressing as in its last note you understand besides unlesshis majesty the emperor derogates from the principle of our alliancewait i have not finished he said to prince andrew seizing him bythe arm i believe that intervention will be stronger thannonintervention and he paused finally one cannot impute thenonreceipt of our dispatch of november  that is how it will end andhe released bolkonskis arm to indicate that he had now quite finisheddemosthenes i know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy goldenmouth said bilibin and the mop of hair on his head moved withsatisfactioneverybody laughed and hippolyte louder than anyone he was evidentlydistressed and breathed painfully but could not restrain the wildlaughter that convulsed his usually impassive featureswell now gentlemen said bilibin bolkonski is my guest in thishouse and in brunn itself i want to entertain him as far as i can withall the pleasures of life here if we were in vienna it would be easybut here in this wretched moravian hole it is more difficult and ibeg you all to help me brunns attractions must be shown him you canundertake the theater i society and you hippolyte of course thewomenwe must let him see amelie shes exquisite said one of ourskissing his finger tipsin general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humaneinterests said bilibini shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitalitygentlemen it is already time for me to go replied prince andrewlooking at his watchwhere toto the emperoroh oh oh well au revoir bolkonski au revoir prince come backearly to dinner cried several voices well take you in handwhen speaking to the emperor try as far as you can to praise the waythat provisions are supplied and the routes indicated said bilibinaccompanying him to the halli should like to speak well of them but as far as i know the facts icant replied bolkonski smilingwell talk as much as you can anyway he has a passion for givingaudiences but he does not like talking himself and cant do it as youwill seeat the levee prince andrew stood among the austrian officers as he hadbeen told to and the emperor francis merely looked fixedly into hisface and just nodded to him with his long head but after it was overthe adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informedbolkonski that the emperor desired to give him an audience the emperorfrancis received him standing in the middle of the room before theconversation began prince andrew was struck by the fact that the emperorseemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to saytell me when did the battle begin he asked hurriedlyprince andrew replied then followed other questions just as simplewas kutuzov well when had he left krems and so on the emperor spokeas if his sole aim were to put a given number of questionsthe answersto these questions as was only too evident did not interest himat what oclock did the battle begin asked the emperori cannot inform your majesty at what oclock the battle began at thefront but at durrenstein where i was our attack began after five inthe afternoon replied bolkonski growing more animated and expectingthat he would have a chance to give a reliable account which he hadready in his mind of all he knew and had seen but the emperor smiledand interrupted himhow many milesfrom where to where your majestyfrom durrenstein to kremsthree and a half miles your majestythe french have abandoned the left bankaccording to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during thenightis there sufficient forage in kremsforage has not been supplied to the extentthe emperor interrupted himat what oclock was general schmidt killedat seven oclock i believeat seven oclock its very sad very sadthe emperor thanked prince andrew and bowed prince andrew withdrew andwas immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides everywhere he sawfriendly looks and heard friendly words yesterdays adjutant reproachedhim for not having stayed at the palace and offered him his own housethe minister of war came up and congratulated him on the maria theresaorder of the third grade which the emperor was conferring on him theempress chamberlain invited him to see her majesty the archduchessalso wished to see him he did not know whom to answer and for a fewseconds collected his thoughts then the russian ambassador took him bythe shoulder led him to the window and began to talk to himcontrary to bilibins forecast the news he had brought was joyfullyreceived a thanksgiving service was arranged kutuzov was awarded thegrand cross of maria theresa and the whole army received rewardsbolkonski was invited everywhere and had to spend the whole morningcalling on the principal austrian dignitaries between four and five inthe afternoon having made all his calls he was returning to bilibinshouse thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visitto brunn at the door he found a vehicle half full of luggage franzbilibins man was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out ofthe front doorbefore returning to bilibins prince andrew had gone to a bookshop toprovide himself with some books for the campaign and had spent sometime in the shopwhat is it he askedoh your excellency said franz with difficulty rolling theportmanteau into the vehicle we are to move on still farther thescoundrel is again at our heelseh what asked prince andrewbilibin came out to meet him his usually calm face showed excitementthere now confess that this is delightful said he this affair ofthe thabor bridge at vienna they have crossed without striking ablowprince andrew could not understandbut where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the townknowsi come from the archduchess i heard nothing thereand you didnt see that everybody is packing upi did not what is it all about inquired prince andrew impatientlywhats it all about why the french have crossed the bridge thatauersperg was defending and the bridge was not blown up so murat isnow rushing along the road to brunn and will be here in a day or twowhat here but why did they not blow up the bridge if it was minedthat is what i ask you no one not even bonaparte knows whybolkonski shrugged his shouldersbut if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost itwill be cut off said hethats just it answered bilibin listen the french entered viennaas i told you very well next day which was yesterday thosegentlemen messieurs les marechaux  murat lannes and belliard mountand ride to the bridge observe that all three are gasconsgentlemen says one of them you know the thabor

side of the danube marchingon us you and your lines of communication the marshallsstop jesting said prince andrew sadly and seriously this newsgrieved him and yet he was pleasedas soon as he learned that the russian army was in such a hopelesssituation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead itout of this position that here was the toulon that would lift him fromthe ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to famelistening to bilibin he was already imagining how on reaching the armyhe would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only onethat could save the army and how he alone would be entrusted with theexecuting of the planstop this jesting he saidi am not jesting bilibin went on nothing is truer or sadder thesegentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs theyassure the officer on duty that they the marshals are on their way tonegotiate with prince auersperg he lets them enter the ttedepont they spin him a thousand gasconades saying that the war is over thatthe emperor francis is arranging a meeting with bonaparte that theydesire to see prince auersperg and so on the officer sends forauersperg these gentlemen embrace the officers crack jokes sit on thecannon and meanwhile a french battalion gets to the bridge unobservedflings the bags of incendiary material into the water and approachesthe

anothers hand the emperor napoleon burns with impatienceto make prince auerspergs acquaintance in a word those gentlemengascons indeed so bewildered him with fine words and he is soflattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the french marshalsand so dazzled by the sight of murats mantle and ostrich plumes quilny voit que du feu et oublie celui quil devait faire faire surlennemi  in spite of the animation of his speech bilibin did notforget to pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciationthe french battalion rushes to the bridgehead spikes the guns and thebridge is taken but what is best of all he went on his excitementsubsiding under the delightful interest of his own story is that thesergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to firethe mines and blow up the bridge this sergeant seeing that the frenchtroops were running onto the bridge was about to fire but lannesstayed his hand the sergeant who was evidently wiser than his generalgoes up to auersperg and says prince you are being deceived here arethe french murat seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowedto speak turns to auersperg with feigned astonishment he is a truegascon and says i dont recognize the worldfamous austriandiscipline if you allow a subordinate to address you like that it wasa stroke of genius prince auersperg feels his dignity at stake andorders the sergeant to be arrested come you must own that this affairof the thabor bridge is delightful it is not exactly stupidity norrascality bridgehead  that their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that he ought tobe firing at the enemyit may be treachery said prince andrew vividly imagining the grayovercoats wounds the smoke of gunpowder the sounds of firing and theglory that awaited himnot that either that puts the court in too bad a light repliedbilibin its not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity it is just asat ulm it ishe seemed to be trying to find the rightexpression cest cest du mack nous sommes mackes it is it isa bit of mack we are macked he concluded feeling that he hadproduced a good epigram a fresh one that would be repeated hishitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure and with aslight smile he began to examine his nailswhere are you off to he said suddenly to prince andrew who had risenand was going toward his roomi am going awaywhere toto the armybut you meant to stay another two daysbut now i am off at onceand prince andrew after giving directions about his departure went tohis roomdo you know mon cher said bilibin following him i have beenthinking about you why are you goingand in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinklesvanished from his faceprince andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no replywhy are you going i know you think it your duty to gallop back to thearmy now that it is in danger i understand that mon cher it isheroismnot at all said prince andrewbut as you are a philosopher be a consistent one look at the otherside of the question and you will see that your duty on the contraryis to take care of yourself leave it to those who are no longer fit foranything else you have not been ordered to return and have not beendismissed from here therefore you can stay and go with us wherever ourill luck takes us they say we are going to olmutz and olmutz is a verydecent town you and i will travel comfortably in my calechedo stop joking bilibin cried bolkonskii am speaking sincerely as a friend consider where and why are yougoing when you might remain here you are faced by one of two thingsand the skin over his left temple puckered either you will not reachyour regiment before peace is concluded or you will share defeat anddisgrace with kutuzovs whole armyand bilibin unwrinkled his temple feeling that the dilemma wasinsolublei cannot argue about it replied prince andrew coldly but he thoughti am going to save the armymy dear fellow you are a hero said bilibinthat same night having taken leave of the minister of war bolkonskiset off to rejoin the army not knowing where he would find it andfearing to be captured by the french on the way to kremsin brunn everybody attached to the court was packing up and the heavybaggage was already being dispatched to olmutz near hetzelsdorf princeandrew struck the high road along which the russian army was moving withgreat haste and in the greatest disorder the road was so obstructedwith carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage prince andrewtook a horse and a cossack from a cossack commander and hungry andweary making his way past the baggage wagons rode in search of thecommanderinchief and of his own luggage very sinister reports of theposition of the army reached him as he went along and the appearance ofthe troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumorscette armee russe que lor de langleterre a transportee des extremitesde lunivers nous allons lui faire eprouver le meme sortle sort delarmee dulm  he remembered these words in bonapartes address tohis army at the beginning of the campaign and they awoke in himastonishment at the genius of his hero a feeling of wounded pride anda hope of glory and should there be nothing left but to die hethought well if need be i shall do it no worse than others that russian army which has been brought from the ends of the earthby english gold we shall cause to share the same fatethe fate of thearmy at ulmhe looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachmentscarts guns artillery and again baggage wagons and vehicles of allkinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road three andsometimes four abreast from all sides behind and before as far as earcould reach there were the rattle of wheels the creaking of carts andgun carriages the tramp of horses the crack of whips shouts theurging of horses and the swearing of soldiers orderlies and officersall along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen someflayed some not and brokendown carts beside which solitary soldierssat waiting for something and again soldiers straggling from theircompanies crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages orreturned from them dragging sheep fowls hay and bulging sacks ateach ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and thedin of shouting more incessant soldiers floundering kneedeep in mudpushed the guns and wagons themselves whips cracked hoofs slippedtraces broke and lungs were strained with shouting the officersdirecting the march rode backward and forward between the carts theirvoices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their facesthat they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorderhere is our dear orthodox russian army thought bolkonski recallingbilibins wordswishing to find out where the commanderinchief was he rode up to aconvoy directly opposite to him came a strange onehorse vehicleevidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials andlooking like something between a cart a cabriolet and a caleche asoldier was driving and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind theapron under the leather hood of the vehicle prince andrew rode up andwas just putting his question to a soldier when his attention wasdiverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle anofficer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was drivingthe womans vehicle for trying to get ahead of others and the strokesof his whip fell on the apron of the equipage the woman screamedpiercingly seeing prince andrew she leaned out from behind the apronand waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl criedmr aidedecamp mr aidedecamp for heavens sake protect mewhat will become of us i am the wife of the doctor of the seventhchasseurs they wont let us pass we are left behind and have lostour peopleill flatten you into a pancake shouted the angry officer to thesoldier turn back with your slutmr aidedecamp help me what does it all mean screamed thedoctors wifekindly let this cart pass dont you see its a woman said princeandrew riding up to the officerthe officer glanced at him and without replying turned again to thesoldier ill teach you to push on backlet them pass i tell you repeated prince andrew compressing hislipsand who are you cried the officer turning on him with tipsy ragewho are you are you in command here eh i am commander here not yougo back or ill flatten you into a pancake repeated he thisexpression evidently pleased himthat was a nice snub for the little aidedecamp came a voice frombehindprince andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless tipsyrage when a man does not know what he is saying he saw that hischampionship of the doctors wife in her queer trap might expose him towhat he dreaded more than anything in the worldto ridicule but hisinstinct urged him on before the officer finished his sentence princeandrew his face distorted with fury rode up to him and raised hisriding whipkindly letthempassthe officer flourished his arm and hastily rode awayits all the fault of these fellows on the staff that theres thisdisorder he muttered do as you likeprince andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from thedoctors wife who was calling him her deliverer and recalling with asense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene hegalloped on to the village where he was told that the commanderinchiefwason reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest houseintending to rest if but for a moment eat something and try to sortout the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind thisis a mob of scoundrels and not an army he was thinking as he went upto the window of the first house when a familiar voice called him bynamehe turned round nesvitskis handsome face looked out of the littlewindow nesvitski moving his moist lips as he chewed something andflourishing his arm called him to enterbolkonski bolkonski dont you hear eh come quick he shoutedentering the house prince andrew saw nesvitski and another adjutanthaving something to eat they hastily turned round to him asking if hehad any news on their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm thiswas particularly noticeable on nesvitskis usually laughing countenancewhere is the commanderinchief asked bolkonskihere in that house answered the adjutantwell is it true that its peace and capitulation asked nesvitskii was going to ask you i know nothing except that it was all i coulddo to get hereand we my dear boy its terrible i was wrong to laugh at mack weregetting it still worse said nesvitski but sit down and havesomething to eatyou wont be able to find either your baggage or anything else nowprince and god only knows where your man peter is said the otheradjutantwhere

bad lookout old fellow but whats the matterwith you you must be ill to shiver like that he added noticing thatprince andrew winced as at an electric shockits nothing replied prince andrewhe had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctors wife andthe convoy officerwhat is the commanderinchief doing here he askedi cant make out at all said nesvitskiwell all i can make out is that everything is abominable abominablequite abominable said prince andrew and he went off to the housewhere the commanderinchief waspassing by kutuzovs carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of hissuite with their cossacks who were talking loudly together princeandrew entered the passage kutuzov himself he was told was in thehouse with prince bagration and weyrother weyrother was the austriangeneral who had succeeded schmidt in the passage little kozlovski wassquatting on his heels in front of a clerk the clerk with cuffs turnedup was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards kozlovskis facelooked wornhe too had evidently not slept all night he glanced atprince andrew and did not even nod to himsecond line have you written it he continued dictating to theclerk the kiev grenadiers podolianone cant write so fast your honor said the clerk glancing angrilyand disrespectfully at kozlovskithrough the door came the sounds of kutuzovs voice excited anddissatisfied interrupted by another an unfamiliar voice from thesound of these voices the inattentive way kozlovski looked at him thedisrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk the fact that the clerk andkozlovski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commanderin chief and from the noisy laughter of the cossacks holding the horsesnear the window prince andrew felt that something important anddisastrous was about to happenhe turned to kozlovski with urgent questionsimmediately prince said kozlovski dispositions for bagrationwhat about capitulationnothing of the sort orders are issued for a battleprince andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard justas he was going to open it the sounds ceased the door opened andkutuzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorwayprince andrew stood right in front of kutuzov but the expression of thecommander in chiefs one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied withthoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence he lookedstraight at his adjutants face without recognizing himwell have you finished said he to kozlovskione moment your excellencybagration a gaunt middleaged man of medium height with a firmimpassive face of oriental type came out after the commanderinchiefi have the honor to present myself repeated prince andrew ratherloudly handing kutuzov an envelopeah from vienna very good later laterkutuzov went out into the porch with bagrationwell goodby prince said he to bagration my blessing and maychrist be with you in your great endeavorhis face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes with his lefthand he drew bagration toward him and with his right on which he worea ring he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidentlyhabitual offering his puffy cheek but bagration kissed him on the neckinsteadchrist be with you kutuzov repeated and went toward his carriageget in with me said he to bolkonskiyour excellency i should like to be of use here allow me to remainwith prince bagrations detachmentget in said kutuzov and noticing that bolkonski still delayed headded i need good officers myself need them myselfthey got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silencethere is still much much before us he said as if with an old manspenetration he understood all that was passing in bolkonskis mind ifa tenth part of his detachment returns i shall thank god he added asif speaking to himselfprince andrew glanced at kutuzovs face only a foot distant from him andinvoluntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near histemple where an ismail bullet had pierced his skull and the empty eyesocket yes he has a right to speak so calmly of those mens deaththought bolkonskithat is why i beg to be sent to that detachment he saidkutuzov did not reply he seemed to have forgotten what he had beensaying and sat plunged in thought five minutes later gently swayingon the soft springs of the carriage he turned to prince andrew therewas not a trace of agitation on his face with delicate irony hequestioned prince andrew about the details of his interview with theemperor about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the kremsaffair and about some ladies they both knewon november  kutuzov had received through a spy news that the army hecommanded was in an almost hopeless position the spy reported that thefrench after crossing the bridge at vienna were advancing in immenseforce upon kutuzovs line of communication with the troops that werearriving from russia if kutuzov decided to remain at krems napoleonsarmy of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him off completelyand surround his exhausted army of forty thousand and he would findhimself in the position of mack at ulm if kutuzov decided to abandonthe road connecting him with the troops arriving from russia he wouldhave to march with no road into unknown parts of the bohemian mountainsdefending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoningall hope of a junction with buxhowden if kutuzov decided to retreatalong the road from krems to olmutz to unite with the troops arrivingfrom russia he risked being forestalled on that road by the french whohad crossed the vienna bridge and encumbered by his baggage andtransport having to accept battle on the march against an enemy threetimes as strong who would hem him in from two sideskutuzov chose this latter coursethe french the spy reported having crossed the vienna bridge wereadvancing by forced marches toward znaim which lay sixtysix miles offon the line of kutuzovs retreat if he reached znaim before the frenchthere would be great hope of saving the army to let the frenchforestall him at znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to adisgrace such as that of ulm or to utter destruction but to forestallthe french with his whole army was impossible the road for the frenchfrom vienna to znaim was shorter and better than the road for therussians from krems to znaimthe night he received the news kutuzov sent bagrations vanguard fourthousand strong to the right across the hills from the kremsznaim tothe viennaznaim road bagration was to make this march without restingand to halt facing vienna with znaim to his rear and if he succeeded inforestalling the french he was to delay them as long as possiblekutuzov himself with all his transport took the road to znaimmarching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills with hishungry illshod soldiers and losing a third of his men as stragglersby the way bagration came out on the viennaznaim road at hollabrunn afew hours ahead of the french who were approaching hollabrunn fromvienna kutuzov with his transport had still to march for some daysbefore he could reach znaim hence bagration with his four thousandhungry exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy armythat came upon him at hollabrunn which was clearly impossible but afreak of fate made the impossible possible the success of the trickthat had placed the vienna bridge in the hands of the french without afight led murat to try to deceive kutuzov in a similar way meetingbagrations weak detachment on the znaim road he supposed it to bekutuzovs whole army to be able to crush it absolutely he awaited thearrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from vienna andwith this object offered a three days truce on condition that botharmies should remain in position without moving murat declared thatnegotiations for peace were already proceeding and that he thereforeoffered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed count nostitz theaustrian general occupying the advanced posts believed murats emissaryand retired leaving bagrations division exposed another emissary rodeto the russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer therussian army the three days truce bagration replied that he was notauthorized either to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant tokutuzov to report the offer he had receiveda truce was kutuzovs sole chance of gaining time giving bagrationsexhausted troops some rest and letting the transport and heavy convoyswhose movements were concealed from the french advance if but onestage nearer znaim the offer of a truce gave the only and a quiteunexpected chance of saving the army on receiving the news heimmediately dispatched adjutant general wintzingerode who was inattendance on him to the enemy camp wintzingerode was not merely toagree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation andmeanwhile kutuzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost themovements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the kremsznaimroad bagrations exhausted and hungry detachment which alone coveredthis movement of the transport and of the whole army had to remainstationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itselfkutuzovs expectations that the proposals of capitulation which were inno way binding might give time for part of the transport to pass andalso that murats mistake would very soon be discovered proved correctas soon as bonaparte who was at schonbrunn sixteen miles fromhollabrunn received murats dispatch with the proposal of a truce and acapitulation he detected a ruse and wrote the following letter tomuratschonbrunn th brumaire at eight oclock in the morningto prince murati cannot find words to express to you my displeasure you command onlymy advance guard and have no right to arrange an armistice without myorder you are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign break thearmistice immediately and march on the enemy inform him that thegeneral who signed that capitulation had no right to do so and that noone but the emperor of russia has that rightif however the emperor of russia ratifies that convention i willratify it but it is only a trick march on destroy the russianarmy you are in a position to seize its baggage and artillerythe russian emperors aidedecamp is an impostor officers are nothingwhen they have no powers this one had none the austrians letthemselves be tricked at the crossing of the vienna bridge you areletting yourself be tricked by an aidedecamp of the emperornapoleonbonapartes adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter tomurat bonaparte himself not trusting to his generals moved with allthe guards to the field of battle afraid of letting a ready victimescape and bagrations four thousand men merrily lighted campfiresdried and warmed themselves cooked their porridge for the first timefor three days and not one of them knew or imagined what was in storefor himbetween three and four oclock in the afternoon prince andrew who hadpersisted in his request to kutuzov arrived at grunth and reportedhimself to bagration bonapartes adjutant had not yet reached muratsdetachment and the battle had not yet begun in bagrations detachmentno one knew anything of the general position of affairs they talked ofpeace but did not believe in its possibility others talked of a battlebut also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement bagrationknowing bolkonski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant received himwith distinction and special marks of favor explaining to him thatthere would probably be an engagement that day or the next and givinghim full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join therearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat which is also veryimportanthowever there will hardly be an engagement today said bagration asif to reassure prince andrewif he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a medalhe can get his reward just as well in the rearguard but if he wishes tostay with me let him hell be of use here if hes a brave officerthought bagration prince andrew without replying asked the princespermission to ride round the position to see the disposition of theforces so as to know his bearings should he be sent to execute anorder the officer on duty a handsome elegantly dressed man with adiamond ring on his forefinger who was fond of speaking french thoughhe spoke it badly offered to conduct prince andrewon all sides they saw rainsoaked officers with dejected faces whoseemed to be seeking something and soldiers dragging doors benchesand fencing from the villagethere now prince we cant stop those fellows said the staff officerpointing to the soldiers the officers dont keep them in hand andthere he pointed to a sutlers tent they crowd in and sit thismorning i turned them all out and now look its full again i must gothere prince and scare them a bit it wont take a momentyes lets go in and i will get myself a roll and some cheese saidprince andrew who had not yet had time to eat anythingwhy didnt you mention it prince i would have offered you somethingthey dismounted and entered the tent several officers with flushed andweary faces were sitting at the table eating and drinkingnow what does this mean gentlemen said the staff officer in thereproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more thanonce you know it wont do to leave your posts like this the princegave orders that no one should leave his post now you captain and heturned to a thin dirty little artillery officer who without his bootshe had given them to the canteen keeper to dry in only his stockingsrose when they entered smiling not altogether comfortablywell arent you ashamed of yourself captain tushin he continuedone would think that as an artillery officer you would set a goodexample yet here you are without your boots the alarm will be soundedand youll be in a pretty position without your boots the staffofficer smiled kindly return to your posts gentlemen all of youall he added in a tone of commandprince andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officertushin who silent and smiling shifting from one stockinged foot to theother glanced inquiringly with his large intelligent kindly eyes fromprince andrew to the staff officerthe soldiers say it feels easier without boots said captain tushinsmiling shyly in his uncomfortable position evidently wishing to adopta jocular tone but before he had finished he felt that his jest wasunacceptable and had not come off he grew confusedkindly return to your posts said the staff officer trying to preservehis gravityprince andrew glanced again at the artillery officers small figurethere was something peculiar about it quite unsoldierly rather comicbut extremely attractivethe staff officer and prince andrew mounted their horses and rode onhaving ridden beyond the village continually meeting and overtakingsoldiers and officers of various regiments they saw on their left someentrenchments being thrown up the freshly dug clay of which showed upred several battalions of soldiers in their shirt sleeves despite thecold wind swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white antsspadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind thebank by unseen hands prince andrew and the officer rode up looked atthe entrenchment and went on again just behind it they came upon somedozens of soldiers continually replaced by others who ran from theentrenchment they had to hold their noses and put their horses to atrot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrinesvoila lagrement des camps monsieur le prince  said the staffofficer this is a pleasure one gets in camp princethey rode up the opposite hill from there the french could already beseen prince andrew stopped and began examining the positionthats our battery said the staff officer indicating the highestpoint its in charge of the queer fellow we saw without his boots youcan see everything from there lets go there princethank you very much i will go on alone said prince andrew wishingto rid himself of this staff officers company please dont troubleyourself furtherthe staff officer remained behind and prince andrew rode on alonethe farther forward and nearer the enemy he went the more orderly andcheerful were the troops the greatest disorder and depression had beenin the baggage train he had passed that morning on the znaim road sevenmiles away from the french at grunth also some apprehension and alarmcould be felt but the nearer prince andrew came to the french lines themore confident was the appearance of our troops the soldiers in theirgreatcoats were ranged in lines the sergeants major and companyofficers were counting the men poking the last man in each section inthe ribs and telling him to hold his hand up soldiers scattered overthe whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were buildingshelters with merry chatter and laughter around the fires sat othersdressed and undressed drying their shirts and leg bands or mendingboots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookersin one company dinner was ready and the soldiers were gazing eagerly atthe steaming boiler waiting till the sample which a quartermastersergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a logbefore his shelter had been tastedanother company a lucky one for not all the companies had vodkacrowded round a pockmarked broadshouldered sergeant major who tiltinga keg filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him thesoldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential facesemptied them rolling the vodka in their mouths and walked away fromthe sergeant major with brightened expressions licking their lips andwiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats all their faces were asserene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peacefulencampment and not within sight of the enemy before an action in whichat least half of them would be left on the field after passing achasseur regiment and in the lines of the kiev grenadiersfine fellowsbusy with similar peaceful affairsnear the shelter of the regimentalcommander higher than and different from the others prince andrew cameout in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man twosoldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches andstriking him regularly on his bare back the man shrieked unnaturally astout major was pacing up and down the line and regardless of thescreams kept repeatingits a shame for a soldier to steal a soldier must be honesthonorable and brave but if he robs his fellows there is no honor inhim hes a scoundrel go on go onso the swishing sound of the strokes and the desperate but unnaturalscreams continuedgo on go on said the majora young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his facestepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutantas he rode byprince andrew having reached the front line rode along it our frontline and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanksbut in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed thatmorning the lines were so near together that the men could see oneanothers faces and speak to one another besides the soldiers whoformed the picket line on either side there were many curious onlookerswho jesting and laughing stared at their strange foreign enemiessince early morningdespite an injunction not to approach the picketlinethe officers had been unable to keep sightseers away thesoldiers forming the picket line like showmen exhibiting a curiosityno longer looked at the french but paid attention to the sightseers andgrew weary waiting to be relieved prince andrew halted to have a lookat the frenchlook look there one soldier was saying to another pointing to arussian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer andwas rapidly and excitedly talking to a french grenadier hark to himjabbering fine isnt it its all the frenchy can do to keep up withhim there now sidorovwait a bit and listen its fine answered sidorov who was consideredan adept at frenchthe soldier to whom the laughers referred was dolokhov prince andrewrecognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying dolokhov hadcome from the left flank where their regiment was stationed with hiscaptainnow then go on go on incited the officer bending forward andtrying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible tohim more please more whats he sayingdolokhov did not answer the captain he had been drawn into a hotdispute with the french grenadier they were naturally talking about thecampaign the frenchman confusing the austrians with the russians wastrying to prove that the russians had surrendered and had fled all theway from ulm while dolokhov maintained that the russians had notsurrendered but had beaten the frenchwe have orders to drive you off here and we shall drive you off saiddolokhovonly take care you and your cossacks are not all captured said thefrench grenadierthe french onlookers and listeners laughedwell make you dance as we did under suvorov  said dolokhov on vous fera danserqu estce quil chante  asked a frenchman whats he singing aboutits ancient history said another guessing that it referred to aformer war the emperor will teach your suvara as he has taught theothersbonaparte began dolokhov but the frenchman interrupted himnot bonaparte he is the emperor sacre nom cried he angrilythe devil skin your emperorand dolokhov swore at him in coarse soldiers russian and shoulderinghis musket walked awaylet us go ivan lukich he said to the captainah thats the way to talk french said the picket soldiers nowsidorov you have a trysidorov turning to the french winked and began to jabber meaninglesssounds very fast kari mala tafa safi muter kaska he saidtrying to give an expressive intonation to his voiceho ho ho ha ha ha ha ouh ouh came peals of such healthy andgoodhumored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the frenchinvoluntarily so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be tounload the muskets explode the ammunition and all return home asquickly as possiblebut the guns remained loaded the loopholes in blockhouses andentrenchments looked out just as menacingly and the unlimbered cannonconfronted one another as beforehaving ridden round the whole line from right flank to left princeandrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer hadtold him the whole field could be seen here he dismounted and stoppedbeside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon before the guns anartillery sentry was pacing up and down he stood at attention when theofficer arrived but at a sign resumed his measured monotonous pacingbehind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropesand artillerymens bonfires to the left not far from the farthestcannon was a small newly constructed wattle shed from which came thesound of officers voices in eager conversationit was true that a view over nearly the whole russian position and thegreater part of the enemys opened out from this battery just facingit on the crest of the opposite hill the village of schon graberncould be seen and in three places to left and right the french troopsamid the smoke of their campfires the greater part of whom wereevidently in the village itself and behind the hill to the left fromthat village amid the smoke was something resembling a battery but itwas impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye our right flank wasposted on a rather steep incline which dominated the french positionour infantry were stationed there and at the farthest point thedragoons in the center where tushins battery stood and from whichprince andrew was surveying the position was the easiest and mostdirect descent and ascent to the brook separating us from schon grabernon the left our troops were close to a copse in which smoked thebonfires of our infantry who were felling wood the french line waswider than ours and it was plain that they could easily outflank us onboth sides behind our position was a steep and deep dip making itdifficult for artillery and cavalry to retire prince andrew took outhis notebook and leaning on the cannon sketched a plan of theposition he made some notes on two points intending to mention them tobagration his idea was first to concentrate all the artillery in thecenter and secondly to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of thedip prince andrew being always near the commander in chief closelyfollowing the mass movements and general orders and constantly studyinghistorical accounts of battles involuntarily pictured to himself thecourse of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline he imaginedonly important possibilities if the enemy attacks the right flank hesaid to himself the kiev grenadiers and the podolsk chasseurs musthold their position till reserves from the center come up in that casethe dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack if theyattack our center we having the center battery on this high groundshall withdraw the left flank under its cover and retreat to the dip byechelons so he reasoned all the time he had been beside the gunhe had heard the voices of the officers distinctly but as often happenshad not understood a word of what they were saying suddenly howeverhe was struck by a voice coming from the shed and its tone was sosincere that he could not but listenno friend said a pleasant and as it seemed to prince andrew afamiliar voice what i say is that if it were possible to know what isbeyond death none of us would be afraid of it thats so friendanother a younger voice interrupted him afraid or not you cantescape it anyhowall the same one is afraid oh you clever people said a third manlyvoice interrupting them both of course you artillery men are verywise because you can take everything along with youvodka and snacksand the owner of the manly voice evidently an infantry officerlaughedyes one is afraid continued the first speaker he of the familiarvoice one is afraid of the unknown thats what it is whatever we maysay about the soul going to the sky we know there is no sky but onlyan atmospherethe manly voice again interrupted the artillery officerwell stand us some of your herb vodka tushin it saidwhy thought prince andrew thats the captain who stood up in thesutlers hut without his boots he recognized the agreeablephilosophizing voice with pleasuresome herb vodka certainly said tushin but still to conceive afuture lifehe did not finish just then there was a whistle in the air nearer andnearer faster and louder louder and faster a cannon ball as if ithad not finished saying what was necessary thudded into the ground nearthe shed with super human force throwing up a mass of earth the groundseemed to groan at the terrible impactand immediately tushin with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth andhis kind intelligent face rather pale rushed out of the shed followedby the owner of the manly voice a dashing infantry officer who hurriedoff to his company buttoning up his coat as he ranmounting his horse again prince andrew lingered with the batterylooking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball his eyes ranrapidly over the wide space but he only saw that the hithertomotionless masses of the french now swayed and that there really was abattery to their left the smoke above it had not yet dispersed twomounted frenchmen probably adjutants were galloping up the hill asmall but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hillprobably to strengthen the front line the smoke of the first shot hadnot yet dispersed before another puff appeared followed by a reportthe battle had begun prince andrew turned his horse and galloped backto grunth to find prince bagration he heard the cannonade behind himgrowing louder and more frequent evidently our guns had begun to replyfrom the bottom of the slope where the parleys had taken place camethe report of musketrylemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with bonapartes stern letterand murat humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault had at oncemoved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the russianwings hoping before evening and before the arrival of the emperor tocrush the contemptible detachment that stood before himit has begun here it is thought prince andrew feeling the bloodrush to his heart but where and how will my toulon present itselfpassing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinkingvodka a quarter of an hour before he saw everywhere the same rapidmovement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready andon all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled hisheart it has begun here it is dreadful but enjoyable was what theface of each soldier and each officer seemed to saybefore he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up he sawin the light of the dull autumn evening mounted men coming toward himthe foremost wearing a cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding awhite horse was prince bagration prince andrew stopped waiting forhim to come up prince bagration reined in his horse and recognizingprince andrew nodded to him he still looked ahead while prince andrewtold him what he had seenthe feeling it has begun here it is was seen even on princebagrations hard brown face with its halfclosed dull sleepy eyesprince andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face andwished he could tell what if anything this man was thinking andfeeling at that moment is there anything at all behind that impassiveface prince andrew asked himself as he looked prince bagration benthis head in sign of agreement with what prince andrew told him andsaid very good in a tone that seemed to imply that everything thattook place and was reported to him was exactly what he had foreseenprince andrew out of breath with his rapid ride spoke quickly princebagration uttering his words with an oriental accent spokeparticularly slowly as if to impress the fact that there was no need tohurry however he put his horse to a trot in the direction of tushinsbattery prince andrew followed with the suite behind prince bagrationrode an officer of the suite the princes personal adjutant zherkovan orderly officer the staff officer on duty riding a fine bobtailedhorse and a civilianan accountant who had asked permission to bepresent at the battle out of curiosity the accountant a stout fullfaced man looked around him with a naive smile of satisfaction andpresented a strange appearance among the hussars cossacks andadjutants in his camlet coat as he jolted on his horse with a convoyofficers saddlehe wants to see a battle said zherkov to bolkonski pointing to theaccountant but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach alreadyoh leave off said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunningsmile as if flattered at being made the subject of zherkovs joke andpurposely trying to appear stupider than he really wasit is very strange mon monsieur prince said the staff officer heremembered that in french there is some peculiar way of addressing aprince but could not get it quite rightby this time they were all approaching tushins battery and a ballstruck the ground in front of themwhats that that has fallen asked the accountant with a naive smilea french pancake answered zherkovso thats what they hit with asked the accountant how awfulhe seemed to swell with satisfaction he had hardly finished speakingwhen they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenlyended with a thud into something soft ffflop and a cossack ridinga little to their right and behind the accountant crashed to earth withhis horse zherkov and the staff officer bent over their saddles andturned their horses away the accountant stopped facing the cossackand examined him with attentive curiosity the cossack was dead but thehorse still struggledprince bagration screwed up his eyes looked round and seeing thecause of the confusion turned away with indifference as if to say isit worth while noticing trifles he reined in his horse with the careof a skillful rider and slightly bending over disengaged his saberwhich had caught in his cloak it was an oldfashioned saber of a kindno longer in general use prince andrew remembered the story of suvorovgiving his saber to bagration in italy and the recollection wasparticularly pleasant at that moment they had reached the battery atwhich prince andrew had been when he examined the battlefieldwhose company asked prince bagration of an artilleryman standing bythe ammunition wagonhe asked whose company but he really meant are you frightenedhere and the artilleryman understood himcaptain tushins your excellency shouted the redhaired freckledgunner in a merry voice standing to attentionyes yes muttered bagration as if considering something and he rodepast the limbers to the farthest cannonas he approached a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and hissuite and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could seethe gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to itsformer position a huge broadshouldered gunner number one holding amop his legs far apart sprang to the wheel while number two with atrembling hand placed a charge in the cannons mouth the short roundshouldered captain tushin stumbling over the tail of the gun carriagemoved forward and not noticing the general looked out shading his eyeswith his small handlift it two lines more and it will be just right cried he in a feeblevoice to which he tried to impart a dashing note illsuited to his weakfigure number two he squeaked fire medvedevbagration called to him and tushin raising three fingers to his capwith a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute butlike a priests benediction approached the general though tushinsguns had been intended to cannonade the valley he was firing incendiaryballs at the village of schon grabern visible just opposite in front ofwhich large masses of french were advancingno one had given tushin orders where and at what to fire but afterconsulting his sergeant major zakharchenko for whom he had greatrespect he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to thevillage very good said bagration in reply to the officers reportand began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended beforehim the french had advanced nearest on our right below the height onwhich the kiev regiment was stationed in the hollow where the rivuletflowed the soulstirring rolling and crackling of musketry was heardand much farther to the right beyond the dragoons the officer of thesuite pointed out to bagration a french column that was outflanking usto the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood prince bagrationordered two battalions from the center to be sent to reinforce the rightflank the officer of the suite ventured to remark to the prince that ifthese battalions went away the guns would remain without supportprince bagration turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked athim in silence it seemed to prince andrew that the officers remark wasjust and that really no answer could be made to it but at that momentan adjutant galloped up with a message from the commander of theregiment in the hollow and news that immense masses of the french werecoming down upon them and that his regiment was in disorder and wasretreating upon the kiev grenadiers prince bagration bowed his head insign of assent and approval he rode off at a walk to the right and sentan adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the french but thisadjutant returned half an hour later with the news that the commander ofthe dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in the ground as aheavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing men uselessly andso had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the woodvery good said bagrationas he was leaving the battery firing was heard on the left also and asit was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go therehimself prince bagration sent zherkov to tell the general in commandthe one who had paraded his regiment before kutuzov at braunau that hemust retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear asthe right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemysattack very long about tushin and the battalion that had been insupport of his battery all was forgotten prince andrew listenedattentively to bagrations colloquies with the commanding officers andthe orders he gave them and to his surprise found that no orders werereally given but that prince bagration tried to make it appear thateverything done by necessity by accident or by the will of subordinatecommanders was done if not by his direct command at least in accordwith his intentions prince andrew noticed however that though whathappened was due to chance and was independent of the commanders willowing to the tact bagration showed his presence was very valuableofficers who approached him with disturbed countenances became calmsoldiers and officers greeted him gaily grew more cheerful in hispresence and were evidently anxious to display their courage beforehimprince bagration having reached the highest point of our right flankbegan riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but whereon account of the smoke nothing could be seen the nearer they got tothe hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearnessof the actual battlefield they began to meet wounded men one with ableeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers whosupported him under the arms there was a gurgle in his throat and hewas spitting blood a bullet had evidently hit him in the throat ormouth another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musketgroaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt whileblood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle he hadthat moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than sufferingcrossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men lyingon the ground they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom wereunwounded the soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily anddespite the generals presence were talking loudly and gesticulating infront of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through thesmoke and an officer catching sight of bagration rushed shouting afterthe crowd of retreating soldiers ordering them back bagration rode upto the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there drowningthe sound of voices and the shouts of command the whole air reeked withsmoke the excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it somewere using their ramrods others putting powder on the touchpans ortaking charges from their pouches while others were firing though whothey were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was nowind to carry away a pleasant humming and whistling of bullets wereoften heard what is this thought prince andrew approaching the crowdof soldiers it cant be an attack for they are not moving it cantbe a squarefor they are not drawn up for thatthe commander of the regiment a thin feeblelooking old man with apleasant smilehis eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyesgiving him a mild expression rode up to bagration and welcomed him as ahost welcomes an honored guest he reported that his regiment had beenattacked by french cavalry and that though the attack had beenrepulsed he had lost more than half his men he said the attack hadbeen repulsed employing this military term to describe what hadoccurred to his regiment but in reality he did not himself know whathad happened during that halfhour to the troops entrusted to him andcould not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or hisregiment had been broken up all he knew was that at the commencement ofthe action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment andhitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted cavalry and ourmen had begun firing they were still firing not at the cavalry whichhad disappeared but at french infantry who had come into the hollow andwere firing at our men prince bagration bowed his head as a sign thatthis was exactly what he had desired and expected turning to hisadjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the sixthchasseurs whom they had just passed prince andrew was struck by thechanged expression on prince bagrations face at this moment itexpressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of aman who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the waterthe dull sleepy expression was no longer there nor the affectation ofprofound thought the round steady hawks eyes looked before himeagerly and rather disdainfully not resting on anything although hismovements were still slow and measuredthe commander of the regiment turned to prince bagration entreating himto go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were pleaseyour excellency for gods sake he kept saying glancing for supportat an officer of the suite who turned away from him there you seeand he drew attention to the bullets whistling singing and hissingcontinually around them he spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproachthat a carpenter uses to a gentleman who has picked up an ax we areused to it but you sir will blister your hands he spoke as if thosebullets could not kill him and his halfclosed eyes gave still morepersuasiveness to his words the staff officer joined in the colonelsappeals but bagration did not reply he only gave an order to ceasefiring and reform so as to give room for the two approachingbattalions while he was speaking the curtain of smoke that hadconcealed the hollow driven by a rising wind began to move from rightto left as if drawn by an invisible hand and the hill opposite withthe french moving about on it opened out before them all eyes fastenedinvoluntarily on this french column advancing against them and windingdown over the uneven ground one could already see the soldiers shaggycaps distinguish the officers from the men and see the standardflapping against its staffthey march splendidly remarked someone in bagrations suitethe head of the column had already descended into the hollow the clashwould take place on this side of itthe remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed upand moved to the right from behind it dispersing the laggards cametwo battalions of the sixth chasseurs in fine order before they hadreached bagration the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in stepcould be heard on their left flank nearest to bagration marched acompany commander a fine roundfaced man with a stupid and happyexpressionthe same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed at thatmoment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow hewould appear as he passed the commanderwith the selfsatisfaction of a man on parade he stepped lightly withhis muscular legs as if sailing along stretching himself to his fullheight without the smallest effort his ease contrasting with the heavytread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him he carried closeto his leg a narrow unsheathed sword small curved and not like a realweapon and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the menwithout losing step his whole powerful body turning flexibly it was asif all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commanderin the best possible manner and feeling that he was doing it well hewas happy left left left he seemed to repeat to himself ateach alternate step and in time to this with stern but varied facesthe wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched instep and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeatingto himself at each alternate step left left left a fat majorskirted a bush puffing and falling out of step a soldier who hadfallen behind his face showing alarm at his defection ran at a trotpanting to catch up with his company a cannon ball cleaving the airflew over the heads of bagration and his suite and fell into the columnto the measure of left left close up came the companycommanders voice in jaunty tones the soldiers passed in a semicircleround something where the ball had fallen and an old trooper on theflank a noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside the dead menran to catch up his line and falling into step with a hop looked backangrily and through the ominous silence and the regular tramp of feetbeating the ground in unison one seemed to hear left left leftwell done lads said prince bagrationglad to do our best your exlenlency came a confused shout from theranks a morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes onbagration as he shouted with an expression that seemed to say we knowthat ourselves another without looking round as though fearing torelax shouted with his mouth wide open and passed onthe order was given to halt and down knapsacksbagration rode round the ranks that had marched past him and dismountedhe gave the reins to a cossack took off and handed over his felt coatstretched his legs and set his cap straight the head of the frenchcolumn with its officers leading appeared from below the hillforward with god said bagration in a resolute sonorous voiceturning for a moment to the front line and slightly swinging his armshe went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of acavalryman prince andrew felt that an invisible power was leading himforward and experienced great happinessthe french were already near prince andrew walking beside bagrationcould clearly distinguish their bandoliers red epaulets and even theirfaces he distinctly saw an old french officer who with gaitered legsand turnedout toes climbed the hill with difficulty prince bagrationgave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in front of theranks suddenly one shot after another rang out from the french smokeappeared all along their uneven ranks and musket shots sounded severalof our men fell among them the roundfaced officer who had marched sogaily and complacently but at the moment the first report was heardbagration looked round and shouted hurrahhurrahahah rang a longdrawn shout from our ranks and passingbagration and racing one another they rushed in an irregular but joyousand eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foethe attack of the sixth chasseurs secured the retreat of our rightflank in the center tushins forgotten battery which had managed toset fire to the schon grabern village delayed the french advance thefrench were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading and thusgave us time to retreat the retirement of the center to the other sideof the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy but thedifferent companies did not get mixed but our leftwhich consisted ofthe azov and podolsk infantry and the pavlograd hussarswassimultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior french forces underlannes and was thrown into confusion bagration had sent zherkov to thegeneral commanding that left flank with orders to retreat immediatelyzherkov not removing his hand from his cap turned his horse about andgalloped off but no sooner had he left bagration than his couragefailed him he was seized by panic and could not go where it wasdangeroushaving reached the left flank instead of going to the front where thefiring was he began to look for the general and his staff where theycould not possibly be and so did not deliver the orderthe command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander ofthe regiment kutuzov had reviewed at braunau and in which dolokhov wasserving as a private but the command of the extreme left flank had beenassigned to the commander of the pavlograd regiment in which rostov wasserving and a misunderstanding arose the two commanders were muchexasperated with one another and long after the action had begun on theright flank and the french were already advancing were engaged indiscussion with the sole object of offending one another but theregiments both cavalry and infantry were by no means ready for theimpending action from privates to general they were not expecting abattle and were engaged in peaceful occupations the cavalry feeding thehorses and the infantry collecting woodhe higher iss dan i in rank said the german colonel of the hussarsflushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up so let him dowhat he vill but i cannot sacrifice my hussars bugler sount zeretreatbut haste was becoming imperative cannon and musketry minglingtogether thundered on the right and in the center while the capotes oflannes sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and formingup within twice the range of a musket shot the general in command ofthe infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps and having mounteddrew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the pavlogradcommander the commanders met with polite bows but with secretmalevolence in their heartsonce again colonel said the general i cant leave half my men inthe wood i beg of you i beg of you he repeated to occupy theposition and prepare for an attacki peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business suddenlyreplied the irate colonel if you vere in the cavalryi am not in the cavalry colonel but i am a russian general and if youare not aware of the factquite avare your excellency suddenly shouted the colonel touchinghis horse and turning purple in the face vill you be so goot to cometo ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot i dont vish todestroy my men for your pleasureyou forget yourself colonel i am not considering my own pleasure andi wont allow it to be saidtaking the colonels outburst as a challenge to his courage the generalexpanded his chest and rode frowning beside him to the front line asif their differences would be settled there amongst the bullets theyreached the front several bullets sped over them and they halted insilence there was nothing fresh to be seen from the line for fromwhere they had been before it had been evident that it was impossiblefor cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground as well as thatthe french were outflanking our left the general and colonel lookedsternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cockspreparing for battle each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice inthe other both passed the examination successfully as there wasnothing to be said and neither wished to give occasion for it to bealleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire theywould have remained there for a long time testing each others couragehad it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry and amuffled shout almost behind them in the wood the french had attackedthe men collecting wood in the copse it was no longer possible for thehussars to retreat with the infantry they were cut off from the line ofretreat on the left by the french however inconvenient the position itwas now necessary to attack in order to cut a way through forthemselvesthe squadron in which rostov was serving had scarcely time to mountbefore it was halted facing the enemy again as at the enns bridgethere was nothing between the squadron and the enemy and again thatterrible dividing line of uncertainty and fearresembling the lineseparating the living from the deadlay between them all wereconscious of this unseen line and the question whether they would crossit or not and how they would cross it agitated them allthe colonel rode to the front angrily gave some reply to questions putto him by the officers and like a man desperately insisting on havinghis own way gave an order no one said anything definite but the rumorof an attack spread through the squadron the command to form up rangout and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbardsstill no one moved the troops of the left flank infantry and hussarsalike felt that the commander did not himself know what to do and thisirresolution communicated itself to the menif only they would be quick thought rostov feeling that at last thetime had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had sooften heard from his fellow hussarsfoward with god lads rang out denisovs voice at a twotfowardthe horses croups began to sway in the front line rook pulled at thereins and started of his own accordbefore him on the right rostov saw the front lines of his hussars andstill farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly buttook to be the enemy shots could be heard but some way offfaster came the word of command and rostov felt rooks flanksdrooping as he broke into a galloprostov anticipated his horses movements and became more and moreelated he had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him this tree had beenin the middle of the line that had seemed so terribleand now he hadcrossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible buteverything was becoming more and more happy and animated oh how iwill slash at him thought rostov gripping the hilt of his saberhuraaaah came a roar of voices let anyone come my way nowthought rostov driving his spurs into rook and letting him go at a fullgallop so that he outstripped the others ahead the enemy was alreadyvisible suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep over thesquadron rostov raised his saber ready to strike but at that instantthe trooper nikitenko who was galloping ahead shot away from him androstov felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried forward withunnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot from behind himbondarchuk an hussar he knew jolted against him and looked angrily athim bondarchuks horse swerved and galloped pasthow is it i am not moving i have fallen i am killed rostov askedand answered at the same instant he was alone in the middle of a fieldinstead of the moving horses and hussars backs he saw nothing beforehim but the motionless earth and the stubble around him there was warmblood under his arm no i am wounded and the horse is killed rooktried to rise on his forelegs but fell back pinning his riders legblood was flowing from his head he struggled but could not rise rostovalso tried to rise but fell back his sabretache having become entangledin the saddle where our men were and where the french he did notknow there was no one nearhaving disentangled his leg he rose where on which side was now theline that had so sharply divided the two armies he asked himself andcould not answer can something bad have happened to me he wonderedas he got up and at that moment he felt that something superfluous washanging on his benumbed left arm the wrist felt as if it were not hishe examined his hand carefully vainly trying to find blood on it ahhere are people coming he thought joyfully seeing some men runningtoward him they will help me in front came a man wearing a strangeshako and a blue cloak swarthy sunburned and with a hooked nose thencame two more and many more running behind one of them said somethingstrange not in russian in among the hindmost of these men wearingsimilar shakos was a russian hussar he was being held by the arms andhis horse was being led behind himit must be one of ours a prisoner yes can it be that they will takeme too who are these men thought rostov scarcely believing his eyescan they be french he looked at the approaching frenchmen and thoughbut a moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack themto pieces their proximity now seemed so awful that he could not believehis eyes who are they why are they running can they be coming at meand why to kill me me whom everyone is so fond of he remembered hismothers love for him and his familys and his friends and theenemys intention to kill him seemed impossible but perhaps they maydo it for more than ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot orrealizing the situation the foremost frenchman the one with the hookednose was already so close that the expression of his face could beseen and the excited alien face of that man his bayonet hanging downholding his breath and running so lightly frightened rostov he seizedhis pistol and instead of firing it flung it at the frenchman and ranwith all his might toward the bushes he did not now run with thefeeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the enns bridgebut with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds one singlesentiment that of fear for his young and happy life possessed hiswhole being rapidly leaping the furrows he fled across the field withthe impetuosity he used to show at catchplay now and then turning hisgoodnatured pale young face to look back a shudder of terror wentthrough him no better not look he thought but having reached thebushes he glanced round once more the french had fallen behind andjust as he looked round the first man changed his run to a walk andturning shouted something loudly to a comrade farther back rostovpaused no theres some mistake thought he they cant have wantedto kill me but at the same time his left arm felt as heavy as if aseventypound weight were tied to it he could run no more thefrenchman also stopped and took aim rostov closed his eyes and stoopeddown one bullet and then another whistled past him he mustered hislast remaining strength took hold of his left hand with his right andreached the bushes behind these were some russian sharpshootersthe infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts ofthe wood ran out of it the different companies getting mixed andretreated as a disorderly crowd one soldier in his fear uttered thesenseless cry cut off that is so terrible in battle and that wordinfected the whole crowd with a feeling of panicsurrounded cut off were lost shouted the fugitivesthe moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind the generalrealized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment and thethought that he an exemplary officer of many years service who hadnever been to blame might be held responsible at headquarters fornegligence or inefficiency so staggered him that forgetting therecalcitrant cavalry colonel his own dignity as a general and aboveall quite forgetting the danger and all regard for selfpreservation heclutched the crupper of his saddle and spurring his horse galloped tothe regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around but fortunatelymissed him his one desire was to know what was happening and at anycost correct or remedy the mistake if he had made one so that he anexemplary officer of twentytwo years service who had never beencensured should not be held to blamehaving galloped safely through the french he reached a field behind thecopse across which our men regardless of orders were running anddescending the valley that moment of moral hesitation which decides thefate of battles had arrived would this disorderly crowd of soldiersattend to the voice of their commander or would they disregarding himcontinue their flight despite his desperate shouts that used to seem soterrible to the soldiers despite his furious purple countenancedistorted out of all likeness to his former self and the flourishing ofhis saber the soldiers all continued to run talking firing into theair and disobeying orders the moral hesitation which decided the fateof battles was evidently culminating in a panicthe general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of thepowder smoke and stopped in despair everything seemed lost but at thatmoment the french who were attacking suddenly and without any apparentreason ran back and disappeared from the outskirts and russiansharpshooters showed themselves in the copse it was timokhins companywhich alone had maintained its order in the wood and having lain inambush in a ditch now attacked the french unexpectedly timokhin armedonly with a sword had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry andsuch mad drunken determination that taken by surprise the french hadthrown down their muskets and run dolokhov running beside timokhinkilled a frenchman at close quarters and was the first to seize thesurrendering french officer by his collar our fugitives returned thebattalions reformed and the french who had nearly cut our left flankin half were for the moment repulsed our reserve units were able tojoin up and the fight was at an end the regimental commander and majorekonomov had stopped beside a bridge letting the retreating companiespass by them when a soldier came up and took hold of the commandersstirrup almost leaning against him the man was wearing a bluish coatof broadcloth he had no knapsack or cap his head was bandaged andover his shoulder a french munition pouch was slung he had an officerssword in his hand the soldier was pale his blue eyes looked impudentlyinto the commanders face and his lips were smiling though thecommander was occupied in giving instructions to major ekonomov hecould not help taking notice of the soldieryour excellency here are two trophies said dolokhov pointing to thefrench sword and pouch i have taken an officer prisoner i stopped thecompany dolokhov breathed heavily from weariness and spoke in abruptsentences the whole company can bear witness i beg you will rememberthis your excellencyall right all right replied the commander and turned to majorekonomovbut dolokhov did not go away he untied the handkerchief around hishead pulled it off and showed the blood congealed on his haira bayonet wound i remained at the front remember your excellencytushins battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of theaction did prince bagration still hearing the cannonade in the centersend his orderly staff officer and later prince andrew also to orderthe battery to retire as quickly as possible when the supports attachedto tushins battery had been moved away in the middle of the action bysomeones order the battery had continued firing and was only notcaptured by the french because the enemy could not surmise that anyonecould have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefendedguns on the contrary the energetic action of that battery led thefrench to suppose that herein the centerthe main russian forces wereconcentrated twice they had attempted to attack this point but on eachoccasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated gunson the hillocksoon after prince bagration had left him tushin had succeeded insetting fire to schon grabernlook at them scurrying its burning just see the smoke fine grandlook at the smoke the smoke exclaimed the artillerymen brighteningupall the guns without waiting for orders were being fired in thedirection of the conflagration as if urging each other on the soldierscried at each shot fine thats good look at it grand the firefanned by the breeze was rapidly spreading the french columns that hadadvanced beyond the village went back but as though in revenge for thisfailure the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village and beganfiring them at tushins batteryin their childlike glee aroused by the fire and their luck insuccessfully cannonading the french our artillerymen only noticed thisbattery when two balls and then four more fell among our guns oneknocking over two horses and another tearing off a munitionwagondrivers leg their spirits once roused were however not diminishedbut only changed character the horses were replaced by others from areserve gun carriage the wounded were carried away and the four gunswere turned against the tengun battery tushins companion officer hadbeen killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hourseventeen of the forty men of the guns crews had been disabled but theartillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever twice they noticedthe french appearing below them and then they fired grapeshot at themlittle tushin moving feebly and awkwardly kept telling his orderly torefill my pipe for that one and then scattering sparks from it ranforward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the frenchsmack at em lads he kept saying seizing the guns by the wheels andworking the screws himselfamid the smoke deafened by the incessant reports which always made himjump tushin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun nowaiming now counting the charges now giving orders about replacing deador wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones and shouting in his feeblevoice so high pitched and irresolute his face grew more and moreanimated only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and turnaway from the sight shouting angrily at the men who as is always thecase hesitated about lifting the injured or dead the soldiers for themost part handsome fellows and as is always the case in an artillerycompany a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as theirofficerall looked at their commander like children in an embarrassingsituation and the expression on his face was invariably reflected ontheirsowing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration andactivity tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense offear and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded neveroccurred to him on the contrary he became more and more elated itseemed to him that it was a very long time ago almost a day since hehad first seen the enemy and fired the first shot and that the cornerof the field he stood on was wellknown and familiar ground though hethought of everything considered everything and did everything thebest of officers could do in his position he was in a state akin tofeverish delirium or drunkennessfrom the deafening sounds of his own guns around him the whistle andthud of the enemys cannon balls from the flushed and perspiring facesof the crew bustling round the guns from the sight of the blood of menand horses from the little puffs of smoke on the enemys side alwaysfollowed by a ball flying past and striking the earth a man a gun ahorse from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of his ownhad taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded himpleasure the enemys guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes fromwhich occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smokerthere hes puffing again muttered tushin to himself as a smallcloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by thewindnow look out for the ball well throw it backwhat do you want your honor asked an artilleryman standing closeby who heard him mutteringnothing only a shell he answeredcome along our matvevna he said to himself matvevna  was thename his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery which was largeand of an old pattern the french swarming round their guns seemed tohim like ants in that world the handsome drunkard number one of thesecond guns crew was uncle tushin looked at him more often than atanyone else and took delight in his every movement the sound ofmusketry at the foot of the hill now diminishing now increasingseemed like someones breathing he listened intently to the ebb andflow of these sounds daughter of matthewah breathing again breathing he muttered to himselfhe imagined himself as an enormously tall powerful man who was throwingcannon balls at the french with both handsnow then matvevna dear old lady dont let me down he was saying ashe moved from the gun when a strange unfamiliar voice called above hishead captain tushin captaintushin turned round in dismay it was the staff officer who had turnedhim out of the booth at grunth he was shouting in a gasping voiceare you mad you have twice been ordered to retreat and youwhy are they down on me thought tushin looking in alarm at hissuperiori dont he muttered holding up two fingers to his cap ibut the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say a cannonball flying close to him caused him to duck and bend over his horsehe paused and just as he was about to say something more another ballstopped him he turned his horse and galloped offretire all to retire he shouted from a distancethe soldiers laughed a moment later an adjutant arrived with the sameorderit was prince andrew the first thing he saw on riding up to the spacewhere tushins guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with abroken leg that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horsesblood was gushing from its leg as from a spring among the limbers layseveral dead men one ball after another passed over as he approachedand he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine but the mere thoughtof being afraid roused him again i cannot be afraid thought he anddismounted slowly among the guns he delivered the order and did notleave the battery he decided to have the guns removed from theirpositions and withdrawn in his presence together with tushin steppingacross the bodies and under a terrible fire from the french he attendedto the removal of the gunsa staff officer was here a minute ago but skipped off said anartilleryman to prince andrew not like your honorprince andrew said nothing to tushin they were both so busy as to seemnot to notice one another when having limbered up the only two cannonthat remained uninjured out of the four they began moving down the hillone shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind prince andrew rodeup to tushinwell till we meet again he said holding out his hand to tushingoodbye my dear fellow said tushin dear soul goodbye my dearfellow and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyesthe wind had fallen and black clouds merging with the powder smokehung low over the field of battle on the horizon it was growing darkand the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous thecannonade was dying down but the rattle of musketry behind and on theright sounded oftener and nearer as soon as tushin with his gunscontinually driving round or coming upon wounded men was out of rangeof fire and had descended into the dip he was met by some of the staffamong them the staff officer and zherkov who had been twice sent totushins battery but had never reached it interrupting one anotherthey all gave and transmitted orders as to how to proceedreprimanding and reproaching him tushin gave no orders and silentlyfearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep withoutknowing whyrode behind on his artillery nag though the orders were toabandon the wounded many of them dragged themselves after troops andbegged for seats on the gun carriages the jaunty infantry officer whojust before the battle had rushed out of tushins wattle shed was laidwith a bullet in his stomach on matvevnas carriage at the foot ofthe hill a pale hussar cadet supporting one hand with the other cameup to tushin and asked for a seatcaptain for gods sake ive hurt my arm he said timidly for godssake i cant walk for gods sakeit was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift andbeen refused he asked in a hesitating piteous voicetell them to give me a seat for gods sakegive him a seat said tushin lay a cloak for him to sit on lad hesaid addressing his favorite soldier and where is the woundedofficerhe has been set down he died replied someonehelp him up sit down dear fellow sit down spread out the cloakantonovthe cadet was rostov with one hand he supported the other he was paleand his jaw trembled shivering feverishly he was placed on matvevnathe gun from which they had removed the dead officer the cloak theyspread under him was wet with blood which stained his breeches and armwhat are you wounded my lad said tushin approaching the gun onwhich rostov satno its a sprainthen what is this blood on the gun carriage inquired tushinit was the officer your honor stained it answered the artillerymanwiping away the blood with his coat sleeve as if apologizing for thestate of his gunit was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by theinfantry and having reached the village of gruntersdorf they halted ithad grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten pacesoff and the firing had begun to subside suddenly near by on theright shouting and firing were again heard flashes of shot gleamed inthe darkness this was the last french attack and was met by soldierswho had sheltered in the village houses they all rushed out of thevillage again but tushins guns could not move and the artillerymentushin and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they awaited theirfate the firing died down and soldiers talking eagerly streamed outof a side streetnot hurt petrov asked oneweve given it em hot mate they wont make another push now saidanotheryou couldnt see a thing how they shot at their own fellows nothingcould be seen pitchdark brother isnt there something to drinkthe french had been repulsed for the last time and again and again inthe complete darkness tushins guns moved forward surrounded by thehumming infantry as by a framein the darkness it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowingalways in one direction humming with whispers and talk and the sound ofhoofs and wheels amid the general rumble the groans and voices of thewounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darknessof the night the gloom that enveloped the army was filled with theirgroans which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the nightafter a while the moving mass became agitated someone rode past on awhite horse followed by his suite and said something in passing whatdid he say where to now halt is it did he thank us came eagerquestions from all sides the whole moving mass began pressing closertogether and a report spread that they were ordered to halt evidentlythose in front had halted all remained where they were in the middle ofthe muddy roadfires were lighted and the talk became more audible captain tushinhaving given orders to his company sent a soldier to find a dressingstation or a doctor for the cadet and sat down by a bonfire thesoldiers had kindled on the road rostov too dragged himself to thefire from pain cold and damp a feverish shivering shook his wholebody drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him but he kept awake by anexcruciating pain in his arm for which he could find no satisfactoryposition he kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the firewhich seemed to him dazzlingly red and at the feeble roundshoulderedfigure of tushin who was sitting crosslegged like a turk beside himtushins large kind intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy andcommiseration on rostov who saw that tushin with his whole heart wishedto help him but could notfrom all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry whowere walking driving past and settling down all around the sound ofvoices the tramping feet the horses hoofs moving in mud thecrackling of wood fires near and afar merged into one tremulous rumbleit was no longer as before a dark unseen river flowing through thegloom but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a stormrostov looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before andaround him an infantryman came to the fire squatted on his heels heldhis hands to the blaze and turned away his faceyou dont mind your honor he asked tushin ive lost my companyyour honor i dont know where such bad luckwith the soldier an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up tothe bonfire and addressing tushin asked him to have the guns moved atrifle to let a wagon go past after he had gone two soldiers rushed tothe campfire they were quarreling and fighting desperately each tryingto snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on toyou picked it up i dare say youre very smart one of themshouted hoarselythen a thin pale soldier his neck bandaged with a bloodstained legband came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for watermust one die like a dog said hetushin told them to give the man some water then a cheerful soldier ranup begging a little fire for the infantrya nice little hot torch for the infantry good luck to you fellowcountrymen thanks for the firewell return it with interest saidhe carrying away into the darkness a glowing sticknext came four soldiers carrying something heavy on a cloak and passedby the fire one of them stumbledwho the devil has put the logs on the road snarled hehes deadwhy carry him said anothershut upand they disappeared into the darkness with their loadstill aching tushin asked rostov in a whisperyesyour honor youre wanted by the general he is in the hut here saida gunner coming up to tushincoming friendtushin rose and buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight walkedaway from the firenot far from the artillery campfire in a hut that had been prepared forhim prince bagration sat at dinner talking with some commandingofficers who had gathered at his quarters the little old man with thehalfclosed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone and thegeneral who had served blamelessly for twentytwo years flushed by aglass of vodka and the dinner and the staff officer with the signetring and zherkov uneasily glancing at them all and prince andrewpale with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyesin a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the french andthe accountant with the naive face was feeling its texture shaking hishead in perplexityperhaps because the banner really interested himperhaps because it was hard for him hungry as he was to look on at adinner where there was no place for him in the next hut there was afrench colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons our officerswere flocking in to look at him prince bagration was thanking theindividual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and ourlosses the general whose regiment had been inspected at braunau wasinforming the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawnfrom the wood mustered the men who were woodcutting and allowing thefrench to pass him had made a bayonet charge with two battalions andhad broken up the french troopswhen i saw your excellency that their first battalion wasdisorganized i stopped in the road and thought ill let them come onand will meet them with the fire of the whole battalionand thatswhat i didthe general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managedto do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened perhaps itmight really have been so could one possibly make out amid all thatconfusion what did or did not happenby the way your excellency i should inform you he continuedremembering dolokhovs conversation with kutuzov and his last interviewwith the gentlemanrankerthat private dolokhov who was reduced tothe ranks took a french officer prisoner in my presence andparticularly distinguished himselfi saw the pavlograd hussars attack there your excellency chimed inzherkov looking uneasily around he had not seen the hussars all thatday but had heard about them from an infantry officer they broke uptwo squares your excellencyseveral of those present smiled at zherkovs words expecting one of hisusual jokes but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the gloryof our arms and of the days work they assumed a serious expressionthough many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie devoid of anyfoundation prince bagration turned to the old colonelgentlemen i thank you all all arms have behaved heroically infantrycavalry and artillery how was it that two guns were abandoned in thecenter he inquired searching with his eyes for someone princebagration did not ask about the guns on the left flank he knew that allthe guns there had been abandoned at the very beginning of the actioni think i sent you he added turning to the staff officer on dutyone was damaged answered the staff officer and the other i cantunderstand i was there all the time giving orders and had only justleft it is true that it was hot there he added modestlysomeone mentioned that captain tushin was bivouacking close to thevillage and had already been sent foroh but you were there said prince bagration addressing princeandrewof course we only just missed one another said the staff officerwith a smile to bolkonskii had not the pleasure of seeing you said prince andrew coldly andabruptlyall were silent tushin appeared at the threshold and made his waytimidly from behind the backs of the generals as he stepped past thegenerals in the crowded hut feeling embarrassed as he always was by thesight of his superiors he did not notice the staff of the banner andstumbled over it several of those present laughedhow was it a gun was abandoned asked bagration frowning not so muchat the captain as at those who were laughing among whom zherkov laughedloudestonly now when he was confronted by the stern authorities did his guiltand the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive presentthemselves to tushin in all their horror he had been so excited that hehad not thought about it until that moment the officers laughterconfused him still more he stood before bagration with his lower jawtrembling and was hardly able to mutter i dont know yourexcellency i had no men your excellencyyou might have taken some from the covering troopstushin did not say that there were no covering troops though that wasperfectly true he was afraid of getting some other officer intotrouble and silently fixed his eyes on bagration as a schoolboy who hasblundered looks at an examinerthe silence lasted some time prince bagration apparently not wishingto be severe found nothing to say the others did not venture tointervene prince andrew looked at tushin from under his brows and hisfingers twitched nervouslyyour excellency prince andrew broke the silence with his abruptvoice you were pleased to send me to captain tushins battery i wentthere and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out two gunssmashed and no supports at allprince bagration and tushin looked with equal intentness at bolkonskiwho spoke with suppressed agitationand if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion hecontinued we owe todays success chiefly to the action of that batteryand the heroic endurance of captain tushin and his company and withoutawaiting a reply prince andrew rose and left the tableprince bagration looked at tushin evidently reluctant to show distrustin bolkonskis emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit itbent his head and told tushin that he could go prince andrew went outwith himthank you you saved me my dear fellow said tushinprince andrew gave him a look but said nothing and went away he feltsad and depressed it was all so strange so unlike what he had hopedwho are they why are they here what do they want and when will allthis end thought rostov looking at the changing shadows before himthe pain in his arm became more and more intense irresistibledrowsiness overpowered him red rings danced before his eyes and theimpression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness mergedwith the physical pain it was they these soldierswounded andunwoundedit was they who were crushing weighing down and twistingthe sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder torid himself of them he closed his eyesfor a moment he dozed but in that short interval innumerable thingsappeared to him in a dream his mother and her large white hand sonyasthin little shoulders natashas eyes and laughter denisov with hisvoice and mustache and telyanin and all that affair with telyanin andbogdanich that affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harshvoice and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizinglyincessantly pulling and pressing his arm and always dragging it in onedirection he tried to get away from them but they would not for aninstant let his shoulder move a hairs breadth it would not acheitwould be wellif only they did not pull it but it was impossible toget rid of themhe opened his eyes and looked up the black canopy of night hung lessthan a yard above the glow of the charcoal flakes of falling snow werefluttering in that light tushin had not returned the doctor had notcome he was alone now except for a soldier who was sitting naked atthe other side of the fire warming his thin yellow bodynobody wants me thought rostov there is no one to help me or pityme yet i was once at home strong happy and loved he sighed anddoing so groaned involuntarilyeh is anything hurting you asked the soldier shaking his shirt outover the fire and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and addedwhat a lot of men have been crippled todayfrightfulrostov did not listen to the soldier he looked at the snowflakesfluttering above the fire and remembered a russian winter at his warmbright home his fluffy fur coat his quickly gliding sleigh hishealthy body and all the affection and care of his family and why didi come here he wonderednext day the french army did not renew their attack and the remnant ofbagrations detachment was reunited to kutuzovs armyprince vasili was not a man who deliberately thought out his plansstill less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage he wasmerely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on hadbecome a habit schemes and devices for which he never rightly accountedto himself but which formed the whole interest of his life wereconstantly shaping themselves in his mind arising from thecircumstances and persons he met of these plans he had not merely oneor two in his head but dozens some only beginning to form themselvessome approaching achievement and some in course of disintegration hedid not for instance say to himself this man now has influence imust gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a specialgrant nor did he say to himself pierre is a rich man i must enticehim to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles i needbut when he came across a man of position his instinct immediately toldhim that this man could be useful and without any premeditation princevasili took the first opportunity to gain his confidence flatter himbecome intimate with him and finally make his requesthe had pierre at hand in moscow and procured for him an appointment asgentleman of the bedchamber which at that time conferred the status ofcouncilor of state and insisted on the young man accompanying him topetersburg and staying at his house with apparent absentmindednessyet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thingprince vasili did everything to get pierre to marry his daughter had hethought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural andshown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody bothabove and below him in social standing something always drew him towardthose richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill inseizing the most opportune moment for making use of peoplepierre on unexpectedly becoming count bezukhov and a rich man felthimself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset andpreoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself he had tosign papers to present himself at government offices the purpose ofwhich was not clear to him to question his chief steward to visit hisestate near moscow and to receive many people who formerly did not evenwish to know of his existence but would now have been offended andgrieved had he chosen not to see them these different peoplebusinessmen relations and acquaintances alikewere all disposed totreat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering manner theywere all evidently firmly convinced of pierres noble qualities he wasalways hearing such words as with your remarkable kindness or withyour excellent heart you are yourself so honorable count or werehe as clever as you and so on till he began sincerely to believe inhis own exceptional kindness and extraordinary intelligence the more soas in the depth of his heart it had always seemed to him that he reallywas very kind and intelligent even people who had formerly beenspiteful toward him and evidently unfriendly now became gentle andaffectionate the angry eldest princess with the long waist and hairplastered down like a dolls had come into pierres room after thefuneral with drooping eyes and frequent blushes she told him she wasvery sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not now feel shehad a right to ask him for anything except only for permission afterthe blow she had received to remain for a few weeks longer in the houseshe so loved and where she had sacrificed so much she could not refrainfrom weeping at these words touched that this statuesque princess couldso change pierre took her hand and begged her forgiveness withoutknowing what for from that day the eldest princess quite changed towardpierre and began knitting a striped scarf for himdo this for my sake mon cher after all she had to put up with agreat deal from the deceased said prince vasili to him handing him adeed to sign for the princess benefitprince vasili had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throwthis bonea bill for thirty thousand rublesto the poor princess thatit might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of theinlaid portfolio pierre signed the deed and after that the princessgrew still kinder the younger sisters also became affectionate to himespecially the youngest the pretty one with the mole who often madehim feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting himit seemed so natural to pierre that everyone should like him and itwould have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him that he couldnot but believe in the sincerity of those around him besides he had notime to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not he wasalways busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerfulintoxication he felt as though he were the center of some important andgeneral movement that something was constantly expected of him that ifhe did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many people but if hedid this and that all would be well and he did what was demanded ofhim but still that happy result always remained in the futuremore than anyone else prince vasili took possession of pierres affairsand of pierre himself in those early days from the death of countbezukhov he did not let go his hold of the lad he had the air of a manoppressed by business weary and suffering who yet would not forpitys sake leave this helpless youth who after all was the son ofhis old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth to the capriceof fate and the designs of rogues during the few days he spent inmoscow after the death of count bezukhov he would call pierre or go tohim himself and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of wearinessand assurance as if he were adding every time you know i amoverwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that i troublemyself about you and you also know quite well that what i propose isthe only thing possiblewell my dear fellow tomorrow we are off at last said prince vasilione day closing his eyes and fingering pierres elbow speaking as ifhe were saying something which had long since been agreed upon and couldnot now be altered we start tomorrow and im giving you a place in mycarriage i am very glad all our important business here is nowsettled and i ought to have been off long ago here is something i havereceived from the chancellor i asked him for you and you have beenentered in the diplomatic corps and made a gentleman of the bedchamberthe diplomatic career now lies open before younotwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these wordswere pronounced pierre who had so long been considering his careerwished to make some suggestion but prince vasili interrupted him in thespecial deep cooing tone precluding the possibility of interrupting hisspeech which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion wasneededmais mon cher i did this for my own sake to satisfy my conscienceand there is nothing to thank me for no one has ever complained yet ofbeing too much loved and besides you are free you could throw it uptomorrow but you will see everything for yourself when you get topetersburg it is high time for you to get away from these terriblerecollections prince vasili sighed yes yes my boy and my valetcan go in your carriage ah i was nearly forgetting he added youknow mon cher your father and i had some accounts to settle so i havereceived what was due from the ryazan estate and will keep it you wontrequire it well go into the accounts laterby what was due from the ryazan estate prince vasili meant severalthousand rubles quitrent received from pierres peasants which theprince had retained for himselfin petersburg as in moscow pierre found the same atmosphere ofgentleness and affection he could not refuse the post or rather therank for he did nothing that prince vasili had procured for him andacquaintances invitations and social occupations were so numerousthat even more than in moscow he felt a sense of bewilderment bustleand continual expectation of some good always in front of him but neverattainedof his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in petersburgthe guards had gone to the front dolokhov had been reduced to theranks anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces prince andrewwas abroad so pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as heused to like to spend them or to open his mind by intimate talks with afriend older than himself and whom he respected his whole time wastaken up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at prince vasilishouse in the company of the stout princess his wife and his beautifuldaughter helenelike the others anna pavlovna scherer showed pierre the change ofattitude toward him that had taken place in societyformerly in anna pavlovnas presence pierre had always felt that whathe was saying was out of place tactless and unsuitable that remarkswhich seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became foolishas soon as he uttered them while on the contrary hippolytes stupidestremarks came out clever and apt now everything pierre said wascharmant even if anna pavlovna did not say so he could see that shewished to and only refrained out of regard for his modestyin the beginning of the winter of  pierre received one of annapavlovnas usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added youwill find the beautiful helene here whom it is always delightful toseewhen he read that sentence pierre felt for the first time that somelink which other people recognized had grown up between himself andhelene and that thought both alarmed him as if some obligation werebeing imposed on him which he could not fulfill and pleased him as anentertaining suppositionanna pavlovnas at home was like the former one only the novelty sheoffered her guests this time was not mortemart but a diplomatist freshfrom berlin with the very latest details of the emperor alexandersvisit to potsdam and of how the two august friends had pledgedthemselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold the cause of justiceagainst the enemy of the human race anna pavlovna received pierre witha shade of melancholy evidently relating to the young mans recent lossby the death of count bezukhov everyone constantly considered it a dutyto assure pierre that he was greatly afflicted by the death of thefather he had hardly known and her melancholy was just like the augustmelancholy she showed at the mention of her most august majesty theempress marya fedorovna pierre felt flattered by this anna pavlovnaarranged the different groups in her drawing room with her habitualskill the large group in which were prince vasili and the generalshad the benefit of the diplomat another group was at the tea tablepierre wished to join the former but anna pavlovnawho was in theexcited condition of a commander on a battlefield to whom thousands ofnew and brilliant ideas occur which there is hardly time to put inactionseeing pierre touched his sleeve with her finger sayingwait a bit i have something in view for you this evening sheglanced at helene and smiled at her my dear helene be charitable tomy poor aunt who adores you go and keep her company for ten minutesand that it will not be too dull here is the dear count who will notrefuse to accompany youthe beauty went to the aunt but anna pavlovna detained pierre lookingas if she had to give some final necessary instructionsisnt she exquisite she said to pierre pointing to the statelybeauty as she glided away and how she carries herself for so young agirl such tact such masterly perfection of manner it comes from herheart happy the man who wins her with her the least worldly of menwould occupy a most brilliant position in society dont you think so ionly wanted to know your opinion and anna pavlovna let pierre gopierre in reply sincerely agreed with her as to helenes perfection ofmanner if he ever thought of helene it was just of her beauty and herremarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in societythe old aunt received the two young people in her corner but seemeddesirous of hiding her adoration for helene and inclined rather to showher fear of anna pavlovna she looked at her niece as if inquiring whatshe was to do with these people on leaving them anna pavlovna againtouched pierres sleeve saying i hope you wont say that it is dullin my house again and she glanced at helenehelene smiled with a look implying that she did not admit thepossibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted the auntcoughed swallowed and said in french that she was very pleased to seehelene then she turned to pierre with the same words of welcome and thesame look in the middle of a dull and halting conversation heleneturned to pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave toeveryone pierre was so used to that smile and it had so little meaningfor him that he paid no attention to it the aunt was just speaking ofa collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to pierres father countbezukhov and showed them her own box princess helene asked to see theportrait of the aunts husband on the box lidthat is probably the work of vinesse said pierre mentioning acelebrated miniaturist and he leaned over the table to take thesnuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other tablehe half rose meaning to go round but the aunt handed him the snuffboxpassing it across helenes back helene stooped forward to make roomand looked round with a smile she was as always at evening partieswearing a dress such as was then fashionable cut very low at front andback her bust which had always seemed like marble to pierre was soclose to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive theliving charm of her neck and shoulders so near to his lips that he needonly have bent his head a little to have touched them he was consciousof the warmth of her body the scent of perfume and the creaking of hercorset as she moved he did not see her marble beauty forming a completewhole with her dress but all the charm of her body only covered by hergarments and having once seen this he could not help being aware of itjust as we cannot renew an illusion we have once seen throughso you have never noticed before how beautiful i am helene seemed tosay you had not noticed that i am a woman yes i am a woman who maybelong to anyoneto you too said her glance and at that momentpierre felt that helene not only could but must be his wife and thatit could not be otherwisehe knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at thealtar with her how and when this would be he did not know he did noteven know if it would be a good thing he even felt he knew not whythat it would be a bad thing but he knew it would happenpierre dropped his eyes lifted them again and wished once more to seeher as a distant beauty far removed from him as he had seen her everyday until then but he could no longer do it he could not any morethan a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through themist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he hasonce recognized it to be a tuft of grass she was terribly close to himshe already had power over him and between them there was no longer anybarrier except the barrier of his own willwell i will leave you in your little corner came anna pavlovnasvoice i see you are all right thereand pierre anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anythingreprehensible looked round with a blush it seemed to him that everyoneknew what had happened to him as he knew it himselfa little later when he went up to the large circle anna pavlovna saidto him i hear you are refitting your petersburg housethis was true the architect had told him that it was necessary andpierre without knowing why was having his enormous petersburg housedone upthats a good thing but dont move from prince vasilis it is good tohave a friend like the prince she said smiling at prince vasili iknow something about that dont i and you are still so young you needadvice dont be angry with me for exercising an old womans privilegeshe paused as women always do expecting something after they havementioned their age if you marry it will be a different thing shecontinued uniting them both in one glance pierre did not look athelene nor she at him but she was just as terribly close to him hemuttered something and coloredwhen he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of whathad happened what had happened nothing he had merely understood thatthe woman he had known as a child of whom when her beauty was mentionedhe had said absentmindedly yes shes good looking he hadunderstood that this woman might belong to himbut shes stupid i have myself said she is stupid he thought thereis something nasty something wrong in the feeling she excites in me ihave been told that her brother anatole was in love with her and shewith him that there was quite a scandal and that thats why he was sentaway hippolyte is her brother prince vasili is her father itsbad he reflected but while he was thinking this the reflectionwas still incomplete he caught himself smiling and was conscious thatanother line of thought had sprung up and while thinking of herworthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his wife how shewould love him become quite different and how all he had thought andheard of her might be false and he again saw her not as the daughter ofprince vasili but visualized her whole body only veiled by its graydress but no why did this thought never occur to me before andagain he told himself that it was impossible that there would besomething unnatural and as it seemed to him dishonorable in thismarriage he recalled her former words and looks and the words and looksof those who had seen them together he recalled anna pavlovnas wordsand looks when she spoke to him about his house recalled thousands ofsuch hints from prince vasili and others and was seized by terror lesthe had already in some way bound himself to do something that wasevidently wrong and that he ought not to do but at the very time he wasexpressing this conviction to himself in another part of his mind herimage rose in all its womanly beautyin november  prince vasili had to go on a tour of inspection infour different provinces he had arranged this for himself so as tovisit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son anatolewhere his regiment was stationed and take him to visit prince nicholasbolkonski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of thatrich old man but before leaving home and undertaking these new affairsprince vasili had to settle matters with pierre who it is true hadlatterly spent whole days at home that is in prince vasilis housewhere he was staying and had been absurd excited and foolish inhelenes presence as a lover should be but had not yet proposed toherthis is all very fine but things must be settled said prince vasilito himself with a sorrowful sigh one morning feeling that pierre whowas under such obligations to him but never mind that was notbehaving very well in this matter youth frivolity well god bewith him thought he relishing his own goodness of heart but it mustbe brought to a head the day after tomorrow will be lelyas name day iwill invite two or three people and if he does not understand what heought to do then it will be my affairyes my affair i am her fathersix weeks after anna pavlovnas at home and after the sleepless nightwhen he had decided that to marry helene would be a calamity and that heought to avoid her and go away pierre despite that decision had notleft prince vasilis and felt with terror that in peoples eyes he wasevery day more and more connected with her that it was impossible forhim to return to his former conception of her that he could not breakaway from her and that though it would be a terrible thing he wouldhave to unite his fate with hers he might perhaps have been able tofree himself but that prince vasili who had rarely before givenreceptions now hardly let a day go by without having an evening partyat which pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil the generalpleasure and disappoint everyones expectation prince vasili in therare moments when he was at home would take pierres hand in passingand draw it downwards or absentmindedly hold out his wrinkled cleanshaven cheek for pierre to kiss and would say till tomorrow or bein to dinner or i shall not see you or i am staying in for yoursake and so on and though prince vasili when he stayed in as hesaid for pierres sake hardly exchanged a couple of words with himpierre felt unable to disappoint him every day he said to himself oneand the same thing it is time i understood her and made up my mindwhat she really is was i mistaken before or am i mistaken now no sheis not stupid she is an excellent girl he sometimes said to himselfshe never makes a mistake never says anything stupid she says littlebut what she does say is always clear and simple so she is not stupidshe never was abashed and is not abashed now so she cannot be a badwoman he had often begun to make reflections or think aloud in hercompany and she had always answered him either by a brief butappropriate remarkshowing that it did not interest heror by a silentlook and smile which more palpably than anything else showed pierre hersuperiority she was right in regarding all arguments as nonsense incomparison with that smileshe always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for himalone in which there was something more significant than in the generalsmile that usually brightened her face pierre knew that everyone waswaiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line and he knew thatsooner or later he would step across it but an incomprehensible terrorseized him at the thought of that dreadful step a thousand times duringthat month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer tothat dreadful abyss pierre said to himself what am i doing i needresolution can it be that i have nonehe wished to take a decision but felt with dismay that in this matterhe lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and reallypossessed pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feelthemselves quite innocent and since that day when he was overpowered bya feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at anna pavlovnasan unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire paralyzed his willon helenes name day a small party of just their own peopleas hiswife saidmet for supper at prince vasilis all these friends andrelations had been given to understand that the fate of the young girlwould be decided that evening the visitors were seated at supperprincess kuragina a portly imposing woman who had once been handsomewas sitting at the head of the table on either side of her sat the moreimportant guestsan old general and his wife and anna pavlovnascherer at the other end sat the younger and less important guests andthere too sat the members of the family and pierre and helene side byside prince vasili was not having any supper he went round the tablein a merry mood sitting down now by one now by another of the gueststo each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark except topierre and helene whose presence he seemed not to notice he enlivenedthe whole party the wax candles burned brightly the silver and crystalgleamed so did the ladies toilets and the gold and silver of the mensepaulets servants in scarlet liveries moved round the table theclatter of plates knives and glasses mingled with the animated hum ofseveral conversations at one end of the table the old chamberlain washeard assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately at whichshe laughed at the other could be heard the story of the misfortunes ofsome mary viktorovna or other at the center of the table prince vasiliattracted everybodys attention with a facetious smile on his face hewas telling the ladies about last wednesdays meeting of the imperialcouncil at which sergey kuzmich vyazmitinov the new military governorgeneral of petersburg had received and read the then famous rescript ofthe emperor alexander from the army to sergey kuzmich in which theemperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of thepeoples loyalty that the declaration from petersburg gave himparticular pleasure and that he was proud to be at the head of such anation and would endeavor to be worthy of it this rescript began withthe words sergey kuzmich from all sides reports reach me etcwell and so he never got farther than sergey kuzmich asked one ofthe ladiesexactly not a hairs breadth farther answered prince vasililaughing sergey kuzmich from all sides from all sides sergeykuzmich poor vyazmitinov could not get any farther he began therescript again and again but as soon as he uttered sergey he sobbedkuzmich tears and from all sides was smothered in sobs and hecould get no farther and again his handkerchief and again sergeykuzmich from all sides and tears till at last somebody else wasasked to read itkuzmich from all sides and then tears someone repeatedlaughingdont be unkind cried anna pavlovna from her end of the table holdingup a threatening finger he is such a worthy and excellent man ourdear vyazmitinoveverybody laughed a great deal at the head of the table where thehonored guests sat everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under theinfluence of a variety of exciting sensations only pierre and helenesat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table asuppressed smile brightening both their faces a smile that had nothingto do with sergey kuzmicha smile of bashfulness at their own feelingsbut much as all the rest laughed talked and joked much as theyenjoyed their rhine wine saute and ices and however they avoidedlooking at the young couple and heedless and unobservant as they seemedof them one could feel by the occasional glances they gave that thestory about sergey kuzmich the laughter and the food were all apretense and that the whole attention of that company was directed topierre and helene prince vasili mimicked the sobbing of sergey kuzmichand at the same time his eyes glanced toward his daughter and while helaughed the expression on his face clearly said yes its gettingon it will all be settled today anna pavlovna threatened him onbehalf of our dear vyazmitinov and in her eyes which for aninstant glanced at pierre prince vasili read a congratulation on hisfuture soninlaw and on his daughters happiness the old princesssighed sadly as she offered some wine to the old lady next to her andglanced angrily at her daughter and her sigh seemed to say yestheres nothing left for you and me but to sip sweet wine my dear nowthat the time has come for these young ones to be thus boldlyprovocatively happy and what nonsense all this is that i am sayingthought a diplomatist glancing at the happy faces of the loversthats happinessinto the insignificant trifling and artificial interests uniting thatsociety had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthyand handsome young man and woman for one another and this human feelingdominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatterjests fell flat news was not interesting and the animation wasevidently forced not only the guests but even the footmen waiting attable seemed to feel this and they forgot their duties as they lookedat the beautiful helene with her radiant face and at the red broad andhappy though uneasy face of pierre it seemed as if the very light ofthe candles was focused on those two happy faces alonepierre felt that he was the center of it all and this both pleased andembarrassed him he was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupationhe did not see hear or understand anything clearly only now and thendetached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shotunexpectedly through his mindso it is all finished he thought and how has it all happened howquickly now i know that not because of her alone nor of myself alonebut because of everyone it must inevitably come about they are allexpecting it they are so sure that it will happen that i cannot icannot disappoint them but how will it be i do not know but it willcertainly happen thought pierre glancing at those dazzling shouldersclose to his eyesor he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what he felt itawkward to attract everyones attention and to be considered a lucky manand with his plain face to be looked on as a sort of paris possessedof a helen but no doubt it always is and must be so he consoledhimself and besides what have i done to bring it about how did itbegin i traveled from moscow with prince vasili then there wasnothing so why should i not stay at his house then i played cards withher and picked up her reticule and drove out with her how did it beginwhen did it all come about and here he was sitting by her side as herbetrothed seeing hearing feeling her nearness her breathing hermovements her beauty then it would suddenly seem to him that it wasnot she but he was so unusually beautiful and that that was why theyall looked so at him and flattered by this general admiration he wouldexpand his chest raise his head and rejoice at his good fortunesuddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a secondtime but pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what wassaidi am asking you when you last heard from bolkonski repeated princevasili a third time how absentminded you are my dear fellowprince vasili smiled and pierre noticed that everyone was smiling athim and helene well what of it if you all know it thought pierrewhat of it its the truth and he himself smiled his gentle childlikesmile and helene smiled toowhen did you get the letter was it from olmutz repeated princevasili who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a disputehow can one talk or think of such trifles thought pierreyes from olmutz he answered with a sighafter supper pierre with his partner followed the others into thedrawing room the guests began to disperse some without taking leave ofhelene some as if unwilling to distract her from an importantoccupation came up to her for a moment and made haste to go awayrefusing to let her see them off the diplomatist preserved a mournfulsilence as he left the drawing room he pictured the vanity of hisdiplomatic career in comparison with pierres happiness the old generalgrumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was oh the old foolhe thought that princess helene will be beautiful still when shesfiftyi think i may congratulate you whispered anna pavlovna to the oldprincess kissing her soundly if i hadnt this headache id havestayed longerthe old princess did not reply she was tormented by jealousy of herdaughters happinesswhile the guests were taking their leave pierre remained for a long timealone with helene in the little drawing room where they were sitting hehad often before during the last six weeks remained alone with herbut had never spoken to her of love now he felt that it was inevitablebut he could not make up his mind to take the final step he feltashamed he felt that he was occupying someone elses place here besidehelene this happiness is not for you some inner voice whispered tohim this happiness is for those who have not in them what there is inyoubut as he had to say something he began by asking her whether she wassatisfied with the party she replied in her usual simple manner thatthis name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever hadsome of the nearest relatives had not yet left they were sitting in thelarge drawing room prince vasili came up to pierre with languidfootsteps pierre rose and said it was getting late prince vasili gavehim a look of stern inquiry as though what pierre had just said was sostrange that one could not take it in but then the expression ofseverity changed and he drew pierres hand downwards made him sitdown and smiled affectionatelywell lelya he asked turning instantly to his daughter andaddressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural toparents who have petted their children from babyhood but which princevasili had only acquired by imitating other parentsand he again turned to pierresergey kuzmichfrom all sides he said unbuttoning the top button ofhis waistcoatpierre smiled but his smile showed that he knew it was not the storyabout sergey kuzmich that interested prince vasili just then and princevasili saw that pierre knew this he suddenly muttered something andwent away it seemed to pierre that even the prince was disconcertedthe sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world touchedpierre he looked at helene and she too seemed disconcerted and herlook seemed to say well it is your own faultthe step must be taken but i cannot i cannot thought pierre and heagain began speaking about indifferent matters about sergey kuzmichasking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it properlyhelene answered with a smile that she too had missed itwhen prince vasili returned to the drawing room the princess his wifewas talking in low tones to the elderly lady about pierreof course it is a very brilliant match but happiness my dearmarriages are made in heaven replied the elderly ladyprince vasili passed by seeming not to hear the ladies and sat down ona sofa in a far corner of the room he closed his eyes and seemed to bedozing his head sank forward and then he roused himselfaline he said to his wife go and see what they are aboutthe princess went up to the door passed by it with a dignified andindifferent air and glanced into the little drawing room pierre andhelene still sat talking just as beforestill the same she said to her husbandprince vasili frowned twisting his mouth his cheeks quivered and hisface assumed the coarse unpleasant expression peculiar to him shakinghimself he rose threw back his head and with resolute steps went pastthe ladies into the little drawing room with quick steps he wentjoyfully up to pierre his face was so unusually triumphant that pierrerose in alarm on seeing itthank god said prince vasili my wife has told me everything heput one arm around pierre and the other around his daughtermy dearboy lelya i am very pleased his voice trembled i loved yourfather and she will make you a good wife god bless youhe embraced his daughter and then again pierre and kissed him with hismalodorous mouth tears actually moistened his cheeksprincess come here he shoutedthe old princess came in and also wept the elderly lady was using herhandkerchief too pierre was kissed and he kissed the beautifulhelenes hand several times after a while they were left alone againall this had to be and could not be otherwise thought pierre so itis useless to ask whether it is good or bad it is good because itsdefinite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt pierre held thehand of his betrothed in silence looking at her beautiful bosom as itrose and fellhelene he said aloud and pausedsomething special is always said in such cases he thought but couldnot remember what it was that people say he looked at her face shedrew nearer to him her face flushedoh take those off those she said pointing to his spectaclespierre took them off and his eyes besides the strange look eyes havefrom which spectacles have just been removed had also a frightened andinquiring look he was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it butwith a rapid almost brutal movement of her head she intercepted hislips and met them with her own her face struck pierre by its alteredunpleasantly excited expressionit is too late now its done besides i love her thought pierreje vous aime  he said remembering what has to be said at suchmoments but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself i love yousix weeks later he was married and settled in count bezukhovs largenewly furnished petersburg house the happy possessor as people saidof a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of moneyold prince nicholas bolkonski received a letter from prince vasili innovember  announcing that he and his son would be paying him avisit i am starting on a journey of inspection and of course i shallthink nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at the sametime my honored benefactor wrote prince vasili my son anatole isaccompanying me on his way to the army so i hope you will allow himpersonally to express the deep respect that emulating his father hefeels for youit seems that there will be no need to bring mary out suitors arecoming to us of their own accord incautiously remarked the littleprincess on hearing the newsprince nicholas frowned but said nothinga fortnight after the letter prince vasilis servants came one eveningin advance of him and he and his son arrived next dayold bolkonski had always had a poor opinion of prince vasilischaracter but more so recently since in the new reigns of paul andalexander prince vasili had risen to high position and honors and nowfrom the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princesshe saw which way the wind was blowing and his low opinion changed intoa feeling of contemptuous ill will he snorted whenever he mentionedhim on the day of prince vasilis arrival prince bolkonski wasparticularly discontented and out of temper whether he was in a badtemper because prince vasili was coming or whether his being in a badtemper made him specially annoyed at prince vasilis visit he was in abad temper and in the morning tikhon had already advised the architectnot to go to the prince with his reportdo you hear how hes walking said tikhon drawing the architectsattention to the sound of the princes footsteps stepping flat on hisheelswe know what that meanshowever at nine oclock the prince in his velvet coat with a sablecollar and cap went out for his usual walk it had snowed the daybefore and the path to the hothouse along which the prince was in thehabit of walking had been swept the marks of the broom were stillvisible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of thesoft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path the prince wentthrough the conservatories the serfs quarters and the outbuildingsfrowning and silentcan a sleigh pass he asked his overseer a venerable man resemblinghis master in manners and looks who was accompanying him back to thehousethe snow is deep i am having the avenue swept your honorthe prince bowed his head and went up to the porch god be thankedthought the overseer the storm has blown overit would have been hard to drive up your honor he added i heardyour honor that a minister is coming to visit your honorthe prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on himfrowningwhat a minister what minister who gave orders he said in hisshrill harsh voice the road is not swept for the princess mydaughter but for a minister for me there are no ministersyour honor i thoughtyou thought shouted the prince his words coming more and morerapidly and indistinctly you thought rascals blackguards illteach you to think and lifting his stick he swung it and would havehit alpatych the overseer had not the latter instinctively avoided theblow thought blackguards shouted the prince rapidlybut although alpatych frightened at his own temerity in avoiding thestroke came up to the prince bowing his bald head resignedly beforehim or perhaps for that very reason the prince though he continued toshout blackguards throw the snow back on the road did not lifthis stick again but hurried into the housebefore dinner princess mary and mademoiselle bourienne who knew thatthe prince was in a bad humor stood awaiting him mademoisellebourienne with a radiant face that said i know nothing i am the sameas usual and princess mary pale frightened and with downcast eyeswhat she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions sheought to behave like mademoiselle bourienne but could not she thoughtif i seem not to notice he will think that i do not sympathize withhim if i seem sad and out of spirits myself he will say as he hasdone before that im in the dumpsthe prince looked at his daughters frightened face and snortedfool or dummy he mutteredand the other one is not here theyve been telling tales he thoughtreferring to the little princess who was not in the dining roomwhere is the princess he asked hidingshe is not very well answered mademoiselle bourienne with a brightsmile so she wont come down it is natural in her statehm hm muttered the prince sitting downhis plate seemed to him not quite clean and pointing to a spot he flungit away tikhon caught it and handed it to a footman the littleprincess was not unwell but had such an overpowering fear of the princethat hearing he was in a bad humor she had decided not to appeari am afraid for the baby she said to mademoiselle bourienne heavenknows what a fright might doin general at bald hills the little princess lived in constant fear andwith a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not realizebecause the fear was so much the stronger feeling the princereciprocated this antipathy but it was overpowered by his contempt forher when the little princess had grown accustomed to life at baldhills she took a special fancy to mademoiselle bourienne spent wholedays with her asked her to sleep in her room and often talked with herabout the old prince and criticized himso we are to have visitors mon prince remarked mademoisellebourienne unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers hisexcellency prince vasili kuragin and his son i understand she saidinquiringlyhmhis excellency is a puppy i got him his appointment in theservice said the prince disdainfully why his son is coming i dontunderstand perhaps princess elizabeth and princess mary know i dontwant him he looked at his blushing daughter are you unwell todayeh afraid of the minister as that idiot alpatych called him thismorningno mon perethough mademoiselle bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice ofa subject she did not stop talking but chattered about theconservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened andafter the soup the prince became more genialafter dinner he went to see his daughterinlaw the little princesswas sitting at a small table chattering with masha her maid she grewpale on seeing her fatherinlawshe was much altered she was now plain rather than pretty her cheekshad sunk her lip was drawn up and her eyes drawn downyes i feel a kind of oppression she said in reply to the princesquestion as to how she feltdo you want anythingno merci mon perewell all right all righthe left the room and went to the waiting room where alpatych stood withbowed headhas the snow been shoveled backyes your excellency forgive me for heavens sake it was only mystupidityall right all right interrupted the prince and laughing hisunnatural way he stretched out his hand for alpatych to kiss and thenproceeded to his studyprince vasili arrived that evening he was met in the avenue by coachmenand footmen who with loud shouts dragged his sleighs up to one of thelodges over the road purposely laden with snowprince vasili and anatole had separate rooms assigned to themanatole having taken off his overcoat sat with arms akimbo before atable on a corner of which he smilingly and absentmindedly fixed hislarge and handsome eyes he regarded his whole life as a continual roundof amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him andhe looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and uglyheiress in the same way all this might he thought turn out very welland amusingly and why not marry her if she really has so much moneythat never does any harm thought anatolehe shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which hadbecome habitual to him and his handsome head held high entered hisfathers room with the goodhumored and victorious air natural to himprince vasilis two valets were busy dressing him and he looked roundwith much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latterentered as if to say yes thats how i want you to looki say father joking apart is she very hideous anatole asked as ifcontinuing a conversation the subject of which had often been mentionedduring the journeyenough what nonsense above all try to be respectful and cautiouswith the old princeif he starts a row ill go away said prince anatole i cant bearthose old men ehremember for you everything depends on thisin the meantime not only was it known in the maidservants rooms thatthe minister and his son had arrived but the appearance of both hadbeen minutely described princess mary was sitting alone in her roomvainly trying to master her agitationwhy did they write why did lise tell me about it it can neverhappen she said looking at herself in the glass how shall i enterthe drawing room even if i like him i cant now be myself with himthe mere thought of her fathers look filled her with terror the littleprincess and mademoiselle bourienne had already received from masha theladys maid the necessary report of how handsome the ministers sonwas with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows and with what difficultythe father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son had followed himlike an eagle three steps at a time having received this informationthe little princess and mademoiselle bourienne whose chattering voiceshad reached her from the corridor went into princess marys roomyou know theyve come marie said the little princess waddling inand sinking heavily into an armchairshe was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morningbut had on one of her best dresses her hair was carefully done and herface was animated which however did not conceal its sunken and fadedoutlines dressed as she used to be in petersburg society it was stillmore noticeable how much plainer she had become some unobtrusive touchhad been added to mademoiselle bouriennes toilet which rendered herfresh and pretty face yet more attractivewhat are you going to remain as you are dear princess she begantheyll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and weshall have to go down and you have not smartened yourself up at allthe little princess got up rang for the maid and hurriedly and merrilybegan to devise and carry out a plan of how princess mary should bedressed princess marys selfesteem was wounded by the fact that thearrival of a suitor agitated her and still more so by both hercompanions not having the least conception that it could be otherwiseto tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be tobetray her agitation while to decline their offers to dress her wouldprolong their banter and insistence she flushed her beautiful eyesgrew dim red blotches came on her face and it took on the unattractivemartyrlike expression it so often wore as she submitted herself tomademoiselle bourienne and lise both these women quite sincerely triedto make her look pretty she was so plain that neither of them couldthink of her as a rival so they began dressing her with perfectsincerity and with the naive and firm conviction women have that dresscan make a face prettyno really my dear this dress is not pretty said lise lookingsideways at princess mary from a little distance you have a maroondress have it fetched really you know the fate of your whole life maybe at stake but this one is too light its not becomingit was not the dress but the face and whole figure of princess marythat was not pretty but neither mademoiselle bourienne nor the littleprincess felt this they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placedin the hair the hair combed up and the blue scarf arranged lower onthe best maroon dress and so on all would be well they forgot thatthe frightened face and the figure could not be altered and thathowever they might change the setting and adornment of that face itwould still remain piteous and plain after two or three changes towhich princess mary meekly submitted just as her hair had been arrangedon the top of her head a style that quite altered and spoiled herlooks and she had put on a maroon dress with a paleblue scarf thelittle princess walked twice round her now adjusting a fold of thedress with her little hand now arranging the scarf and looking at herwith her head bent first on one side and then on the otherno it will not do she said decidedly clasping her hands no maryreally this dress does not suit you i prefer you in your little grayeveryday dress now please do it for my sake katie she said to themaid bring the princess her gray dress and youll see mademoisellebourienne how i shall arrange it she added smiling with a foretasteof artistic pleasurebut when katie brought the required dress princess mary remainedsitting motionless before the glass looking at her face and saw in themirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering ready to burstinto sobscome dear princess said mademoiselle bourienne just one morelittle effortthe little princess taking the dress from the maid came up to princessmarywell now well arrange something quite simple and becoming she saidthe three voices hers mademoiselle bouriennes and katies who waslaughing at something mingled in a merry sound like the chirping ofbirdsno leave me alone said princess maryher voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birdswas silenced at once they looked at the beautiful large thoughtfuleyes full of tears and of thoughts gazing shiningly and imploringly atthem and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insistat least change your coiffure said the little princess didnt itell you she went on turning reproachfully to mademoiselle bouriennemarys is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in the least notin the least please change itleave me alone please leave me alone it is all quite the same to meanswered a voice struggling with tearsmademoiselle bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselvesthat princess mary in this guise looked very plain worse than usualbut it was too late she was looking at them with an expression theyboth knew an expression thoughtful and sad this expression in princessmary did not frighten them she never inspired fear in anyone but theyknew that when it appeared on her face she became mute and was not tobe shaken in her determinationyou will change it wont you said lise and as princess mary gave noanswer she left the roomprincess mary was left alone she did not comply with lises requestshe not only left her hair as it was but did not even look in herglass letting her arms fall helplessly she sat with downcast eyes andpondered a husband a man a strong dominant and strangely attractivebeing rose in her imagination and carried her into a totally differenthappy world of his own she fancied a child her ownsuch as she hadseen the day before in the arms of her nurses daughterat her ownbreast the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and thechild but no it is impossible i am too ugly she thoughtplease come to tea the prince will be out in a moment came themaids voice at the doorshe roused herself and felt appalled at what she had been thinking andbefore going down she went into the room where the icons hung and hereyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the saviour lit by alamp she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments a painfuldoubt filled her soul could the joy of love of earthly love for a manbe for her in her thoughts of marriage princess mary dreamed ofhappiness and of children but her strongest most deeply hidden longingwas for earthly love the more she tried to hide this feeling fromothers and even from herself the stronger it grew o god she saidhow am i to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil how am ito renounce forever these vile fancies so as peacefully to fulfill thywill and scarcely had she put that question than god gave her theanswer in her own heart desire nothing for thyself seek nothing benot anxious or envious mans future and thy own fate must remain hiddenfrom thee but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything if it begods will to prove thee in the duties of marriage be ready to fulfillhis will with this consoling thought but yet with a hope for thefulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing princess mary sighed andhaving crossed herself went down thinking neither of her gown andcoiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say whatcould all that matter in comparison with the will of god without whosecare not a hair of mans head can fallwhen princess mary came down prince vasili and his son were already inthe drawing room talking to the little princess and mademoisellebourienne when she entered with her heavy step treading on her heelsthe gentlemen and mademoiselle bourienne rose and the little princessindicating her to the gentlemen said voila marie princess mary sawthem all and saw them in detail she saw prince vasilis face seriousfor an instant at the sight of her but immediately smiling again andthe little princess curiously noting the impression marie produced onthe visitors and she saw mademoiselle bourienne with her ribbon andpretty face and her unusually animated look which was fixed on him buthim she could not see she only saw something large brilliant andhandsome moving toward her as she entered the room prince vasiliapproached first and she kissed the bold forehead that bent over herhand and answered his question by saying that on the contrary sheremembered him quite well then anatole came up to her she still couldnot see him she only felt a soft hand taking hers firmly and shetouched with her lips a white forehead over which was beautiful lightbrown hair smelling of pomade when she looked up at him she was struckby his beauty anatole stood with his right thumb under a button of hisuniform his chest expanded and his back drawn in slightly swinging onefoot and with his head a little bent looked with beaming face at theprincess without speaking and evidently not thinking about her at allanatole was not quickwitted nor ready or eloquent in conversation buthe had the faculty so invaluable in society of composure andimperturbable selfpossession if a man lacking in selfconfidenceremains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of theimpropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something to say theeffect is bad but anatole was dumb swung his foot and smilinglyexamined the princess hair it was evident that he could be silent inthis way for a very long time if anyone finds this silenceinconvenient let him talk but i dont want to he seemed to saybesides this in his behavior to women anatole had a manner whichparticularly inspires in them curiosity awe and even loveasupercilious consciousness of his own superiority it was as if he saidto them i know you i know you but why should i bother about youyoud be only too glad of course perhaps he did not really think thiswhen he met womeneven probably he did not for in general he thoughtvery littlebut his looks and manner gave that impression the princessfelt this and as if wishing to show him that she did not even dareexpect to interest him she turned to his father the conversation wasgeneral and animated thanks to princess lises voice and little downylip that lifted over her white teeth she met prince vasili with thatplayful manner often employed by lively chatty people and consisting inthe assumption that between the person they so address and themselvesthere are some semiprivate longestablished jokes and amusingreminiscences though no such reminiscences really existjust as noneexisted in this case prince vasili readily adopted her tone and thelittle princess also drew anatole whom she hardly knew into theseamusing recollections of things that had never occurred mademoisellebourienne also shared them and even princess mary felt herselfpleasantly made to share in these merry reminiscenceshere at least we shall have the benefit of your company all toourselves dear prince said the little princess of course in frenchto prince vasili its not as at annettes  receptions where youalways ran away you remember cette chere annette anna pavlovnaah but you wont talk politics to me like annetteand our little tea tableoh yeswhy is it you were never at annettes the little princess askedanatole ah i know i know she said with a sly glance your brotherhippolyte told me about your goings on oh and she shook her finger athim i have even heard of your doings in parisand didnt hippolyte tell you asked prince vasili turning to his sonand seizing the little princess arm as if she would have run away andhe had just managed to catch her didnt he tell you how he himself waspining for the dear princess and how she showed him the door oh sheis a pearl among women princess he added turning to princess marywhen paris was mentioned mademoiselle bourienne for her part seized theopportunity of joining in the general current of recollectionsshe took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since anatole hadleft paris and how he had liked that city anatole answered thefrenchwoman very readily and looking at her with a smile talked to herabout her native land when he saw the pretty little bourienne anatolecame to the conclusion that he would not find bald hills dull eithernot at all bad he thought examining her not at all bad thatlittle companion i hope she will bring her along with her when weremarried la petite est gentille  the little one is charmingthe old prince dressed leisurely in his study frowning and consideringwhat he was to do the coming of these visitors annoyed him what areprince vasili and that son of his to me prince vasili is a shallowbraggart and his son no doubt is a fine specimen he grumbled tohimself what angered him was that the coming of these visitors revivedin his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle one aboutwhich he always deceived himself the question was whether he could everbring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband theprince never directly asked himself that question knowing beforehandthat he would have to answer it justly and justice clashed not onlywith his feelings but with the very possibility of life life withoutprincess mary little as he seemed to value her was unthinkable to himand why should she marry he thought to be unhappy for certaintheres lise married to andrewa better husband one would think couldhardly be found nowadaysbut is she contented with her lot and whowould marry marie for love plain and awkward theyll take her for herconnections and wealth are there no women living unmarried and eventhe happier for it so thought prince bolkonski while dressing and yetthe question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answerprince vasili had brought his son with the evident intention ofproposing and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answerhis birth and position in society were not bad well ive nothingagainst it the prince said to himself but he must be worthy of herand that is what we shall seethat is what we shall see that is what we shall see he added aloudhe entered the drawing room with his usual alert step glancing rapidlyround the company he noticed the change in the little princess dressmademoiselle bouriennes ribbon princess marys unbecoming coiffuremademoiselle bouriennes and anatoles smiles and the loneliness of hisdaughter amid the general conversation got herself up like a

and he offered his cheekanatole kissed the old man and looked at him with curiosity and perfectcomposure waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father hadtold him to expectprince bolkonski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofaand drawing up an armchair for prince vasili pointed to it and beganquestioning him about political affairs and news he seemed to listenattentively to what prince vasili said but kept glancing at princessmaryand so they are writing from potsdam already he said repeatingprince vasilis last words then rising he suddenly went up to hisdaughteris it for visitors youve got yourself up like that eh said hefine very fine you have done up your hair in this new way for thevisitors and before the visitors i tell you that in future you arenever to dare

then he can stay on he can stay and illsee the old prince snorted let her marry its all the same to mehe screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting from his soni will tell you frankly said prince vasili in the tone of a craftyman convinced of the futility of being cunning with so keensighted acompanion you know you see right through people anatole is nogenius but he is an honest goodhearted lad an excellent son orkinsmanall right all right well seeas always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of timewithout male society on anatoles appearance all the three women ofprince bolkonskis household felt that their life had not been real tillthen their powers of reasoning feeling and observing immediatelyincreased tenfold and their life which seemed to have been passed indarkness was suddenly lit up by a new brightness full of significanceprincess mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure thehandsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbedall her attention he seemed to her kind brave determined manly andmagnanimous she felt convinced of that thousands of dreams of a futurefamily life continually rose in her imagination she drove them away andtried to conceal thembut am i not too cold with him thought the princess i try to bereserved because in the depth of my soul i feel too near to him alreadybut then he cannot know what i think of him and may imagine that i donot like himand princess mary tried but could not manage to be cordial to her newguest poor girl shes devilish ugly thought anatolemademoiselle bourienne also roused to great excitement by anatolesarrival thought in another way of course she a handsome young womanwithout any definite position without relations or even a country didnot intend to devote her life to serving prince bolkonski to readingaloud to him and being friends with princess mary mademoisellebourienne had long been waiting for a russian prince who able toappreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain badly dressedungainly russian princesses would fall in love with her and carry heroff and here at last was a russian prince mademoiselle bourienne knewa story heard from her aunt but finished in her own way which sheliked to repeat to herself it was the story of a girl who had beenseduced and to whom her poor mother sa pauvre mere appeared andreproached her for yielding to a man without being married mademoisellebourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told thisstory to him her seducer and now he a real russian prince hadappeared he would carry her away and then sa pauvre mere would appearand he would marry her so her future shaped itself in mademoisellebouriennes head at the very time she was talking to anatole aboutparis it was not calculation that guided her she did not even for amoment consider what she should do but all this had long been familiarto her and now that anatole had appeared it just grouped itself aroundhim and she wished and tried to please him as much as possiblethe little princess like an old war horse that hears the trumpetunconsciously and quite forgetting her condition prepared for thefamiliar gallop of coquetry without any ulterior motive or anystruggle but with naive and lighthearted gaietyalthough in female society anatole usually assumed the role of a mantired of being run after by women his vanity was flattered by thespectacle of his power over these three women besides that he wasbeginning to feel for the pretty and provocative mademoiselle bouriennethat passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with greatsuddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actionsafter tea the company went into the sitting room and princess mary wasasked to play on the clavichord anatole laughing and in high spiritscame and leaned on his elbows facing her and beside mademoisellebourienne princess mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotionher favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and thelook she felt upon her made that world still more poetic but anatolesexpression though his eyes were fixed on her referred not to her butto the movements of mademoiselle bouriennes little foot which he wasthen touching with his own under the clavichord mademoiselle bouriennewas also looking at princess mary and in her lovely eyes there was alook of fearful joy and hope that was also new to the princesshow she loves me thought princess mary how happy i am now and howhappy i may be with such a friend and such a husband husband can it bepossible she thought not daring to look at his face but stillfeeling his eyes gazing at herin the evening after supper when all were about to retire anatolekissed princess marys hand she did not know how she found the couragebut she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to hershortsighted eyes turning from princess mary he went up and kissedmademoiselle bouriennes hand this was not etiquette but then he dideverything so simply and with such assurance mademoiselle bourienneflushed and gave the princess a frightened lookwhat delicacy thought the princess is it possible that ameliemademoiselle bourienne thinks i could be jealous of her and notvalue her pure affection and devotion to me she went up to her andkissed her warmly anatole went up to kiss the little princess handno no no when your father writes to tell me that you are behavingwell i will give you my hand to kiss not till then she said andsmilingly raising a finger at him she left the roomthey all separated but except anatole who fell asleep as soon as hegot into bed all kept awake a long time that nightis he really to be my husband this stranger who is so kindyes kindthat is the chief thing thought princess mary and fear which she hadseldom experienced came upon her she feared to look round it seemedto her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the darkcorner and this someone was hethe deviland he was also this manwith the white forehead black eyebrows and red lipsshe rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her roommademoiselle bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a longtime that evening vainly expecting someone now smiling at someone nowworking herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mererebuking her for her fallthe little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly madeshe could not lie either on her face or on her side every position wasawkward and uncomfortable and her burden oppressed her now more thanever because anatoles presence had vividly recalled to her the timewhen she was not like that and when everything was light and gay shesat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and katie sleepyand disheveled beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the thirdtime muttering to herselfi told you it was all lumps and holes the little princess repeatedi should be glad enough to fall asleep so its not my fault and hervoice quivered like that of a child about to crythe old prince did not sleep either tikhon half asleep heard himpacing angrily about and snorting the old prince felt as though he hadbeen insulted through his daughter the insult was the more pointedbecause it concerned not himself but another his daughter whom heloved more than himself he kept telling himself that he would considerthe whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act butinstead of that he only excited himself more and morethe first man that turns upshe forgets her father and everythingelse runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlikeherself glad to throw her father over and she knew i should notice itfr fr fr and dont i see that that idiot had eyes only forbouriennei shall have to get rid of her and how is it she has notpride enough to see it if she has no pride for herself she might atleast have some for my sake she must be shown that the blockhead thinksnothing of her and looks only at bourienne no she has no pride butill let her seethe old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making amistake and that anatole meant to flirt with mademoiselle bourienneprincess marys selfesteem would be wounded and his point not to beparted from her would be gained so pacifying himself with thisthought he called tikhon and began to undresswhat devil brought them here thought he while tikhon was putting thenightshirt over his driedup old body and grayhaired chest i neverinvited them they came to disturb my lifeand there is not much of itleftdevil take em he muttered while his head was still covered by theshirttikhon knew his masters habit of sometimes thinking aloud andtherefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression ofthe face that emerged from the shirtgone to bed asked the princetikhon like all good valets instinctively knew the direction of hismasters thoughts he guessed that the question referred to princevasili and his sonthey have gone to bed and put out their lights your excellencyno good no good said the prince rapidly and thrusting his feetinto his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown hewent to the couch on which he sleptthough no words had passed between anatole and mademoiselle bouriennethey quite understood one another as to the first part of their romanceup to the appearance of the pauvre mere they understood that they hadmuch to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking anopportunity since morning to meet one another alone when princess marywent to her fathers room at the usual hour mademoiselle bourienne andanatole met in the conservatoryprincess mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation itseemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would bedecided that day but that they also knew what she thought about it sheread this in tikhons face and in that of prince vasilis valet whomade her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot waterthe old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of hisdaughter that morning princess mary well knew this painstakingexpression of her fathers his face wore that expression when his dryhands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum inarithmetic when rising from his chair he would walk away from herrepeating in a low voice the same words several times overhe came to the point at once treating her ceremoniouslyi have had a proposition made me concerning you he said with anunnatural smile i expect you have guessed that prince vasili has notcome and brought his pupil with him for some reason prince bolkonskireferred to anatole as a pupil for the sake of my beautiful eyeslast night a proposition was made me on your account and as you know myprinciples i refer it to youhow am i to understand you mon pere said the princess growing paleand then

princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapprovalbut at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would bedecided now or never she lowered her eyes so as not to see the gazeunder which she felt that she could not think but would only be able tosubmit from habit and she said i wish only to do your will but if ihad to express my own desire she had no time to finish the oldprince interrupted herthats admirable he shouted he will take you with your dowry andtake mademoiselle bourienne into the bargain shell be the wife whileyouthe prince stopped he saw the effect

father had saidabout mademoiselle bourienne was dreadful it was untrue to be sure butstill it was terrible and she could not help thinking of it she wasgoing straight on through the conservatory neither seeing nor hearinganything when suddenly the wellknown whispering of mademoisellebourienne aroused her she raised her eyes and two steps away sawanatole embracing the frenchwoman and whispering something to her witha horrified expression on his handsome face anatole looked at princessmary but did not at once take his arm from the waist of mademoisellebourienne who had not yet seen

brigadierthe countess had been prepared by anna mikhaylovnas hints at dinner onretiring to her own room she sat in an armchair her eyes fixed on aminiature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox while the tearskept coming into her eyes anna mikhaylovna with the letter came ontiptoe to the countess door and pauseddont come in she said to the old count who was following her comelater and she went in closing the door behind herthe count put his ear to the keyhole and listenedat first he heard the sound of indifferent voices then annamikhaylovnas voice alone in a long speech then a cry then silencethen both voices together with glad intonations and then footstepsanna mikhaylovna opened the door her face wore the proud expression ofa surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits thepublic to appreciate his skillit is done she said to the count pointing triumphantly to thecountess who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait andin the other the letter and pressing them alternately to her lipswhen she saw the count she stretched out her arms to him embraced hisbald head over which she again looked at the letter and the portraitand in order to press them again to her lips she slightly pushed awaythe bald head vera natasha sonya and petya now entered the room andthe reading of the letter began after a brief description of thecampaign and the two battles in which he had taken part and hispromotion nicholas said that he kissed his fathers and mothers handsasking for their blessing and that he kissed vera natasha and petyabesides that he sent greetings to monsieur schelling madame schossand his old nurse and asked them to kiss for him dear sonya whom heloved and thought of just the same as ever when she heard this sonyablushed so that tears came into her eyes and unable to bear the looksturned upon her ran away into the dancing hall whirled round it atfull speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon and flushed andsmiling plumped down on the floor the countess was cryingwhy are you crying mamma asked vera from all he says one should beglad and not crythis was quite true but the count the countess and natasha looked ather reproachfully and who is it she takes after thought thecountessnicholas letter was read over hundreds of times and those who wereconsidered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess for she didnot let it out of her hands the tutors came and the nurses anddmitri and several acquaintances and the countess reread the lettereach time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it freshproofs of nikolenkas virtues how strange how extraordinary howjoyful it seemed that her son the scarcely perceptible motion of whosetiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her that son about whomshe used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count that son who hadfirst learned to say pear and then granny that this son should nowbe away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings a manly warriordoing some kind of mans work of his own without help or guidance theuniversal experience of ages showing that children do growimperceptibly from the cradle to manhood did not exist for thecountess her sons growth toward manhood at each of its stages hadseemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed themillions of human beings who grew up in the same way as twenty yearsbefore it seemed impossible that the little creature who livedsomewhere under her heart would ever cry suck her breast and begin tospeak so now she could not believe that that little creature could bethis strong brave man this model son and officer that judging by thisletter he now waswhat a style how charmingly he describes said she reading thedescriptive part of the letter and what a soul not a word abouthimself not a word about some denisov or other though he himselfi dare say is braver than any of them he says nothing about hissufferings what a heart how like him it is and how he has rememberedeverybody not forgetting anyone i always said when he was only sohighi always saidfor more than a week preparations were being made rough drafts ofletters to nicholas from all the household were written and copied outwhile under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of thecount money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment ofthe newly commissioned officer were collected anna mikhaylovnapractical woman that she was had even managed by favor with armyauthorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herselfand her son she had opportunities of sending her letters to the grandduke constantine pavlovich who commanded the guards the rostovssupposed that the russian guards abroad was quite a definite addressand that if a letter reached the grand duke in command of the guardsthere was no reason why it should not reach the pavlograd regimentwhich was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood and so it wasdecided to send the letters and money by the grand dukes courier toboris and boris was to forward them to nicholas the letters were fromthe old count the countess petya vera natasha and sonya andfinally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various otherthings the old count sent to his sonon the twelfth of november kutuzovs active army in camp beforeolmutz was preparing to be reviewed next day by

regimentshad entered and left the town with their bands playing and by the granddukes orders the men had marched all the way in step a practice onwhich the guards prided themselves the officers on foot and at theirproper posts boris had been quartered and had marched all the waywith berg who was already in command of a company berg who hadobtained his captaincy during the campaign had gained the confidence ofhis superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his moneymatters very satisfactorily boris during the campaign had made theacquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him and by aletter of recommendation he had brought from pierre had becomeacquainted with prince andrew bolkonski through whom he hoped to obtaina post on the commanderinchiefs staff berg and boris having restedafter yesterdays march were sitting clean and neatly dressed at around table in the clean quarters allotted to them playing chess bergheld a smoking pipe between his knees boris in the accurate waycharacteristic of him was building a little pyramid of chessmen withhis delicate white fingers while awaiting bergs move and watched hisopponents face evidently thinking about the game as he always thoughtonly of whatever he was engaged onwell how are you going to get out of that he remarkedwell try to replied berg touching a pawn and then removing hishandat that moment the door openedhere he is at last shouted rostov and berg too oh youpetisenfans allay cushay dormir he exclaimed imitating his russiannurses french at which he and boris used to laugh long agodear me how you have changedboris rose to meet rostov but in doing so did not omit to steady andreplace some chessmen that were falling he was about to embrace hisfriend but nicholas avoided him with that peculiar feeling of youththat dread of beaten tracks and wish to express itself in a mannerdifferent from that of its elders which is often insincere nicholaswished to do something special on meeting his friend he wanted to pinchhim push him do anything but kiss hima thing everybody did butnotwithstanding this boris embraced him in a quiet friendly way andkissed him three timesthey had not met for nearly half a year and being at the age when youngmen take their first steps on lifes road each saw immense changes inthe other quite a new reflection of the society in which they had takenthose first steps both had changed greatly since they last met and bothwere in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in themoh you damned dandies clean and fresh as if youd been to a fete notlike us sinners of the line cried rostov with martial swagger andwith baritone notes in his voice new to boris pointing to his own mudbespattered breeches the german landlady hearing rostovs loud voicepopped her head in at the dooreh is she pretty he asked with a winkwhy do you shout so youll frighten them said boris i did notexpect you today he added i only sent you the note yesterday bybolkonskian adjutant of kutuzovs whos a friend of mine i did notthink he would get it to you so quickly well how are you beenunder fire already asked boriswithout answering rostov shook the soldiers cross of st georgefastened to the cording of his uniform and indicating a bandaged armglanced at berg with a smileas you see he saidindeed yes yes said boris with a smile and we too have had asplendid march you know of course that his imperial highness rodewith our regiment all the time so that we had every comfort and everyadvantage what receptions we had in poland what dinners and balls icant tell you and the tsarevich was very gracious to all ourofficersand the two friends told each other of their doings the one of hishussar revels and life in the fighting line the other of the pleasuresand advantages of service under members of the imperial familyoh you guards said rostov i say send for some wineboris made a grimaceif you really want it said hehe went to his bed drew a purse from under the clean pillow and sentfor wineyes and i have some money and a letter to give you he addedrostov took the letter and throwing the money on the sofa put botharms on the table and began to read after reading a few lines heglanced angrily at berg then meeting his eyes hid his face behind theletterwell theyve sent you a tidy sum said berg eying the heavy pursethat sank into the sofa as for us count we get along on our pay ican tell you for myselfi say berg my dear fellow said rostov when you get a letter fromhome and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everythingover with and i happen to be there ill go at once to be out of yourway do go somewhere anywhere to the devil he exclaimed andimmediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into hisface evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words he addeddont be hurt my dear fellow you know i speak from my heart as to anold acquaintanceoh dont mention it count i quite understand said berg getting upand speaking in a muffled and guttural voicego across to our hosts they invited you added borisberg put on the cleanest of coats without a spot or speck of duststood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his templesupwards in the way affected by the emperor alexander and havingassured himself from the way rostov looked at it that his coat had beennoticed left the room with a pleasant smileoh dear what a beast i am muttered rostov as he read the letterwhyoh what a pig i am not to have written and to have given them such afright oh what a pig i am he repeated flushing suddenly wellhave you sent gabriel for some wine all right lets have somein the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendationto bagration which the old countess at anna mikhaylovnas advice hadobtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son asking him to takeit to its destination and make use of itwhat nonsense much i need it said rostov throwing the letter underthe tablewhy have you thrown that away asked borisit is some letter of recommendation what the devil do i want itforwhy what the devil said boris picking it up and reading theaddress this letter would be of great use to youi want nothing and i wont be anyones adjutantwhy not inquired borisits a lackeys jobyou are still the same dreamer i see remarked boris shaking hisheadand youre still the same diplomatist but thats not the pointcome how are you asked rostovwell as you see so far everythings all right but i confess i shouldmuch like to be an adjutant and not remain at the frontwhybecause when once a man starts on military service he should try tomake as successful a career of it as possibleoh thats it said rostov evidently thinking of something elsehe looked intently and inquiringly into his friends eyes evidentlytrying in vain to find the answer to some questionold gabriel brought in the wineshouldnt we now send for berg asked boris he would drink with youi cantwell send for him and how do you get on with that german askedrostov with a contemptuous smilehe is a very very nice honest and pleasant fellow answered borisagain rostov looked intently into boris eyes and sighed berg returnedand over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officersbecame animated the guardsmen told rostov of their march and how theyhad been made much of in russia poland and abroad they spoke of thesayings and doings of their commander the grand duke and told storiesof his kindness and irascibility berg as usual kept silent when thesubject did not relate to himself but in connection with the stories ofthe grand dukes quick temper he related with gusto how in galicia hehad managed to deal with the grand duke when the latter made a tour ofthe regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement with apleasant smile berg related how the grand duke had ridden up to him in aviolent passion shouting arnauts arnauts was the tsarevichsfavorite expression when he was in a rage and called for the companycommanderwould you believe it count i was not at all alarmed because i knew iwas right without boasting you know i may say that i know the armyorders by heart and know the regulations as well as i do the lordsprayer so count there never is any negligence in my company and somy conscience was at ease i came forward berg stood up and showedhow he presented himself with his hand to his cap and really it wouldhave been difficult for a face to express greater respect and selfcomplacency than his did well he stormed at me as the saying isstormed and stormed and stormed it was not a matter of life but ratherof death as the saying is albanians and devils and tosiberia said berg with a sagacious smile i knew i was in the rightso i kept silent was not that best count hey are you dumb heshouted still i remained silent and what do you think count the nextday it was not even mentioned in the orders of the day thats whatkeeping ones head means thats the way count said berg lightinghis pipe and emitting rings of smokeyes that was fine said rostov smilingbut boris noticed that he was preparing to make fun of berg andskillfully changed the subject he asked him to tell them how and wherehe got his wound this pleased rostov and he began talking about it andas he went on became more and more animated he told them of his schongrabern affair just as those who have taken part in a battle generallydo describe it that is as they would like it to have been as theyhave heard it described by others and as sounds well but not at all asit really was rostov was a truthful young man and would on no accounthave told a deliberate lie he began his story meaning to telleverything just as it happened but imperceptibly involuntarily andinevitably he lapsed into falsehood if he had told the truth to hishearerswho like himself had often heard stories of attacks and hadformed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hearjust such a storythey would either not have believed him or stillworse would have thought that rostov was himself to blame since whatgenerally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happenedto him he could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot andthat he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard ashe could from a frenchman into the wood besides to tell everything asit really happened it would have been necessary to make an effort ofwill to tell only what happened it is very difficult to tell the truthand young people are rarely capable of it his hearers expected a storyof how beside himself and all aflame with excitement he had flown likea storm at the square cut his way in slashed right and left how hissaber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted and so on and so hetold them all thatin the middle of his story just as he was saying you cannot imaginewhat a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack prince andrewwhom boris was expecting entered the room prince andrew who liked tohelp young men was flattered by being asked for his assistance andbeing well disposed toward boris who had managed to please him the daybefore he wished to do what the young man wanted having been sent withpapers from kutuzov to the tsarevich he looked in on boris hoping tofind him alone when he came in and saw an hussar of the line recountinghis military exploits prince andrew could not endure that sort of manhe gave boris a pleasant smile frowned as with halfclosed eyes helooked at rostov bowed slightly and wearily and sat down languidly onthe sofa he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad companyrostov flushed up on noticing this but he did not care this was a merestranger glancing however at boris he saw that he too seemed ashamedof the hussar of the linein spite of prince andrews disagreeable ironical tone in spite of thecontempt with which rostov from his fighting army point of viewregarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomerwas evidently one rostov felt confused blushed and became silentboris inquired what news there might be on the staff and what withoutindiscretion one might ask about our planswe shall probably advance replied bolkonski evidently reluctant tosay more in the presence of a strangerberg took the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as wasrumored the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would bedoubled to this prince andrew answered with a smile that he could giveno opinion on such an important government order and berg laughedgailyas to your business prince andrew continued addressing boris wewill talk of it later and he looked round at rostov come to meafter the review and we will do what is possibleand having glanced round the room prince andrew turned to rostovwhose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing toanger he did not condescend to notice and said i think you weretalking of the schon grabern affair were you therei was there said rostov angrily as if intending to insult the aidedecampbolkonski noticed the hussars state of mind and it amused him with aslightly contemptuous smile he said yes there are many stories nowtold about that affairyes stories repeated rostov loudly looking with eyes suddenly grownfurious now at boris now at bolkonski yes many stories but ourstories are the stories of men who have been under the enemys fire ourstories have some weight not like the stories of those fellows on thestaff who get rewards without doing anythingof whom you imagine me to be one said prince andrew with a quiet andparticularly amiable smilea strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this mansselfpossession mingled at that moment in rostovs souli am not talking about you he said i dont know you and frankly idont want to i am speaking of the staff in generaland i will tell you this prince andrew interrupted in a tone of quietauthority you wish to insult me and i am ready to agree with you thatit would be very easy to do so if you havent sufficient selfrespectbut admit that the time and place are very badly chosen in a day or twowe shall all have to take part in a greater and more serious duel andbesides drubetskoy who says he is an old friend of yours is not atall to blame that my face has the misfortune to displease you howeverhe added rising you know my name and where to find me but dontforget that i do not regard either myself or you as having been at allinsulted and as a man older than you my advice is to let the matterdrop well then on friday after the review i shall expect youdrubetskoy au revoir exclaimed prince andrew and with a bow to themboth he went outonly when prince andrew was gone did rostov think of what he ought tohave said and he was still more angry at having omitted to say it heordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave of boris rode homeshould he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affectedadjutant or really let the matter drop was the question that worriedhim all the way he thought angrily of the pleasure he would have atseeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered byhis pistol and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knewthere was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that veryadjutant whom he so hatedthe day after rostov had been to see boris a review was held of theaustrian and russian troops both those freshly arrived from russia andthose who had been campaigning under kutuzov the two emperors therussian with his heir the tsarevich and the austrian with the archdukeinspected the allied army of eighty thousand menfrom early morning the smart clean troops were on the move forming upon the field before the fortress now thousands of feet and bayonetsmoved and halted at the officers command turned with banners flyingformed up at intervals and wheeled round other similar masses ofinfantry in different uniforms now was heard the rhythmic beat of hoofsand the jingling of showy cavalry in blue red and green braideduniforms with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black roanor gray horses then again spreading out with the brazen clatter of thepolished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with thesmell of linstocks came the artillery which crawled between theinfantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position not only thegenerals in full parade uniforms with their thin or thick waists drawnin to the utmost their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars andwearing scarves and all their decorations not only the elegant pomadedofficers but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face andhis weapons clean and polished to the utmost and every horse groomedtill its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane laysmoothfelt that no small matter was happening but an important andsolemn affair every general and every soldier was conscious of his owninsignificance aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men and yetat the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of thatenormous wholefrom early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by tenoclock all had been brought into due order the ranks were drawn up onthe vast field the whole army was extended in three lines the cavalryin front behind it the artillery and behind that again the infantrya space like a street was left between each two lines of troops thethree parts of that army were sharply distinguished kutuzovs fightingarmy with the pavlograds on the right flank of the front thoserecently arrived from russia both guards and regiments of the line andthe austrian troops but they all stood in the same lines under onecommand and in a like orderlike wind over leaves ran an excited whisper theyre coming theyrecoming alarmed voices were heard and a stir of final preparationswept over all the troopsfrom the direction of olmutz in front of them a group was seenapproaching and at that moment though the day was still a light gustof wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on thelances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs itlooked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing itsjoy at the approach of the emperors one voice was heard shouting eyesfront then like the crowing of cocks at sunrise this was repeated byothers from various sides and all became silentin the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard this wasthe emperors suites the emperors rode up to the flank and thetrumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march itseemed as though not the trumpeters were playing but as if the armyitself rejoicing at the emperors approach had naturally burst intomusic amid these sounds only the youthful kindly voice of the emperoralexander was clearly heard he gave the words of greeting and thefirst regiment roared hurrah so deafeningly continuously andjoyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and theimmensity of the power they constitutedrostov standing in the front lines of kutuzovs army which the tsarapproached first experienced the same feeling as every other man inthat army a feeling of selfforgetfulness a proud consciousness ofmight and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of thistriumphhe felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass and hehimself an insignificant atom in it would go through fire and watercommit crime die or perform deeds of highest heroism and so he couldnot but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that wordhurrah hurrah hurrah thundered from all sides one regiment afteranother greeting the tsar with the strains of the march and thenhurrah then the general march and again hurrah hurrah growingever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roartill the tsar reached it each regiment in its silence and immobilityseemed like a lifeless body but as soon as he came up it became aliveits thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he hadalready passed through the terrible and deafening roar of those voicesamid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned tostone hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly butsymmetrically and above all freely and in front of them two mentheemperors upon them the undivided tensely passionate attention of thatwhole mass of men was concentratedthe handsome young emperor alexander in the uniform of the horseguards wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back with hispleasant face and resonant though not loud voice attracted everyonesattentionrostov was not far from the trumpeters and with his keen sight hadrecognized the tsar and watched his approach when he was within twentypaces and nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of hishandsome happy young face he experienced a feeling of tenderness andecstasy such as he had never before known every trait and everymovement of the tsars seemed to him enchantingstopping in front of the pavlograds the tsar said something in frenchto the austrian emperor and smiledseeing that smile rostov involuntarily smiled himself and felt a stillstronger flow of love for his sovereign he longed to show that love insome way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry the tsarcalled the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to himoh god what would happen to me if the emperor spoke to me thoughtrostov i should die of happinessthe tsar addressed the officers also i thank you all gentlemen ithank you with my whole heart to rostov every word sounded like avoice from heaven how gladly would he have died at once for his tsaryou have earned the st georges standards and will be worthy of themoh to die to die for him thought rostovthe tsar said something more which rostov did not hear and thesoldiers straining their lungs shouted hurrahrostov too bending over his saddle shouted hurrah with all hismight feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout ifonly to express his rapture fullythe tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecidedhow can the emperor be undecided thought rostov but then even thisindecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting like everything elsethe tsar didthat hesitation lasted only an instant the tsars foot in the narrowpointed boot then fashionable touched the groin of the bobtailed baymare he rode his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins and hemoved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aidesdecampfarther and farther he rode away stopping at other regiments till atlast only his white plumes were visible to rostov from amid the suitesthat surrounded the emperorsamong the gentlemen of the suite rostov noticed bolkonski sitting hishorse indolently and carelessly rostov recalled their quarrel ofyesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or oughtnot to challenge bolkonski of course not he now thought is itworth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment at a time of suchlove such rapture and such selfsacrifice what do any of our quarrelsand affronts matter i love and forgive everybody nowwhen the emperor had passed nearly all the regiments the troops began aceremonial march past him and rostov on bedouin recently purchasedfrom denisov rode past too at the rear of his squadronthat is aloneand in full view of the emperorbefore he reached him rostov who was a splendid horseman spurredbedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which theanimal went when excited bending his foaming muzzle to his chest histail extended bedouin as if also conscious of the emperors eye uponhim passed splendidly lifting his feet with a high and gracefulaction as if flying through the air without touching the groundrostov himself his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feelinghimself one with his horse rode past the emperor with a frowning butblissful face like a vewy devil as denisov expressed itfine fellows the pavlograds remarked the emperormy god how happy i should be if he ordered me to leap into the firethis instant thought rostovwhen the review was over the newly arrived officers and alsokutuzovs collected in groups and began to talk about the awards aboutthe austrians and their uniforms about their lines about bonaparteand how badly the latter would fare now especially if the essen corpsarrived and prussia took our sidebut the talk in every group was chiefly about the emperor alexander hisevery word and movement was described with ecstasythey all had but one wish to advance as soon as possible against theenemy under the emperors command commanded by the emperor himself theycould not fail to vanquish anyone be it whom it might so thoughtrostov and most of the officers after the reviewall were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battleswould have made themthe day after the review boris in his best uniform and with hiscomrade bergs best wishes for success rode to olmutz to see bolkonskiwishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself the bestpost he couldpreferably that of adjutant to some important personagea position in the army which seemed to him most attractive it is allvery well for rostov whose father sends him ten thousand rubles at atime to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be anyoneslackey but i who have nothing but my brains have to make a career andmust not miss opportunities but must avail myself of them hereflectedhe did not find prince andrew in olmutz that day but the appearance ofthe town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationedand the two emperors were living with their suites households andcourts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher worldhe knew no one and despite his smart guardsmans uniform all theseexalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriageswith their plumes ribbons and medals both courtiers and military menseemed so immeasurably above him an insignificant officer of theguards that they not only did not wish to but simply could not beaware of his existence at the quarters of the commanderinchiefkutuzov where he inquired for bolkonski all the adjutants and even theorderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a greatmany officers like him were always coming there and that everybody washeartily sick of them in spite of this or rather because of it nextday november  after dinner he again went to olmutz and entering thehouse occupied by kutuzov asked for bolkonski prince andrew was in andboris was shown into a large hall probably formerly used for dancingbut in which five beds now stood and furniture of various kinds atable chairs and a clavichord one adjutant nearest the door wassitting at the table in a persian dressing gown writing another thered stout nesvitski lay on a bed with his arms under his headlaughing with an officer who had sat down beside him a third wasplaying a viennese waltz on the clavichord while a fourth lying on theclavichord sang the tune bolkonski was not there none of thesegentlemen changed his position on seeing boris the one who was writingand whom boris addressed turned round crossly and told him bolkonski wason duty and that he should go through the door on the left into thereception room if he wished to see him boris thanked him and went tothe reception room where he found some ten officers and generalswhen he entered prince andrew his eyes drooping contemptuously withthat peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says if itwere not my duty i would not talk to you for a moment was listeningto an old russian general with decorations who stood very erect almoston tiptoe with a soldiers obsequious expression on his purple facereporting somethingvery well then be so good as to wait said prince andrew to thegeneral in russian speaking with the french intonation he affectedwhen he wished to speak contemptuously and noticing boris princeandrew paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploringhim to hear something more nodded and turned to him with a cheerfulsmileat that moment boris clearly realized what he had before surmised thatin the army besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in themilitary code which he and the others knew in the regiment there wasanother more important subordination which made this tightlacedpurplefaced general wait respectfully while captain prince andrew forhis own pleasure chose to chat with lieutenant drubetskoy more thanever was boris resolved to serve in future not according to the writtencode but under this unwritten law he felt now that merely by havingbeen recommended to prince andrew he had already risen above the generalwho at the front had the power to annihilate him a lieutenant of theguards prince andrew came up to him and took his handi am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday i was fussing aboutwith germans all day we went with weyrother to survey the dispositionswhen germans start being accurate theres no end to itboris smiled as if he understood what prince andrew was alluding to assomething generally known but it was the first time he had heardweyrothers name or even the term dispositionswell my dear fellow so you still want to be an adjutant i have beenthinking about youyes i was thinkingfor some reason boris could not help blushingof asking the commanderinchief he has had a letter from princekuragin about me i only wanted to ask because i fear the guards wontbe in action he added as if in apologyall right all right well talk it over replied prince andrew onlylet me report this gentlemans business and i shall be at yourdisposalwhile prince andrew went to report about the purplefaced general thatgentlemanevidently not sharing boris conception of the advantages ofthe unwritten code of subordinationlooked so fixedly at thepresumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had tosay to the adjutant that boris felt uncomfortable he turned away andwaited impatiently for prince andrews return from the commanderinchiefs roomyou see my dear fellow i have been thinking about you said princeandrew when they had gone into the large room where the clavichord wasits no use your going to the commanderinchief he would say a lot ofpleasant things ask you to dinner that would not be bad as regardsthe unwritten code thought boris but nothing more would come of itthere will soon be a battalion of us aidesdecamp and adjutants butthis is what well do i have a good friend an adjutant general and anexcellent fellow prince dolgorukov and though you may not know it thefact is that now kutuzov with his staff and all of us count for nothingeverything is now centered round the emperor so we will go todolgorukov i have to go there anyhow and i have already spoken to himabout you we shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or finda place for you somewhere nearer the sunprince andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a youngman and help him to worldly success under cover of obtaining help ofthis kind for another which from pride he would never accept forhimself he kept in touch with the circle which confers success andwhich attracted him he very readily took up boris cause and went withhim to dolgorukovit was late in the evening when they entered the palace at olmutzoccupied by the emperors and their retinuesthat same day a council of war had been held in which all the members ofthe hofkriegsrath and both emperors took part at that council contraryto the views of the old generals kutuzov and prince schwartzenberg ithad been decided to advance immediately and give battle to bonapartethe council of war was just over when prince andrew accompanied by borisarrived at the palace to find dolgorukov everyone at headquarters wasstill under the spell of the days council at which the party of theyoung had triumphed the voices of those who counseled delay and advisedwaiting for something else before advancing had been so completelysilenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of theadvantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the councilthecoming battle and the victory that would certainly result from itnolonger seemed to be in the future but in the past all the advantageswere on our side our enormous forces undoubtedly superior tonapoleons were concentrated in one place the troops inspired by theemperors presence were eager for action the strategic position wherethe operations would take place was familiar in all its details to theaustrian general weyrother a lucky accident had ordained that theaustrian army should maneuver the previous year on the very fields wherethe french had now to be fought the adjacent locality was known andshown in every detail on the maps and bonaparte evidently weakenedwas undertaking nothingdolgorukov one of the warmest advocates of an attack had just returnedfrom the council tired and exhausted but eager and proud of the victorythat had been gained prince andrew introduced his protege but princedolgorukov politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to borisand evidently unable to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost inhis mind at that moment addressed prince andrew in frenchah my dear fellow what a battle we have gained god grant that theone that will result from it will be as victorious however dearfellow he said abruptly and eagerly i must confess to having beenunjust to the austrians and especially to weyrother what exactitudewhat minuteness what knowledge of the locality what foresight forevery eventuality every possibility even to the smallest detail no mydear fellow no conditions better than our present ones could have beendevised this combination of austrian precision with russian valorwhatmore could be wished forso the attack is definitely resolved on asked bolkonskiand do you know my dear fellow it seems to me that bonaparte hasdecidedly lost bearings you know that a letter was received from himtoday for the emperor dolgorukov smiled significantlyis that so and what did he say inquired bolkonskiwhat can he say tradiridira and so on merely to gain time itell you he is in our hands thats certain but what was most amusinghe continued with a sudden goodnatured laugh was that we could notthink how to address the reply if not as consul and of course not asemperor it seemed to me it should be to general bonapartebut between not recognizing him as emperor and calling him generalbonaparte there is a difference remarked bolkonskithats just it interrupted dolgorukov quickly laughing you knowbilibinhes a very clever fellow he suggested addressing him asusurper and enemy of mankinddolgorukov laughed merrilyonly that said bolkonskiall the same it was bilibin who found a suitable form for the addresshe is a wise and clever fellowwhat was itto the head of the french government au chef du gouvernementfrancais said dolgorukov with grave satisfaction good wasnt ityes but he will dislike it extremely said bolkonskioh yes very much my brother knows him hes dined with himthepresent emperormore than once in paris and tells me he never met amore cunning or subtle diplomatistyou know a combination of frenchadroitness and italian playacting do you know the tale about him andcount markov count markov was the only man who knew how to handle himyou know the story of the handkerchief it is delightfuland the talkative dolgorukov turning now to boris now to princeandrew told how bonaparte wishing to test markov our ambassadorpurposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking atmarkov probably expecting markov to pick it up for him and how markovimmediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without touchingbonapartesdelightful said bolkonski but i have come to you prince as apetitioner on behalf of this young man you see but before princeandrew could finish an aidedecamp came in to summon dolgorukov to theemperoroh what a nuisance said dolgorukov getting up hurriedly andpressing the hands of prince andrew and boris you know i should bevery glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear youngman again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression ofgoodnatured sincere and animated levity but you see anothertimeboris was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powersas he felt himself to be at that moment he was conscious that here hewas in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormousmovements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tinyobedient and insignificant atom they followed prince dolgorukov outinto the corridor and metcoming out of the door of the emperors roomby which dolgorukov had entereda short man in civilian clothes with aclever face and sharply projecting jaw which without spoiling his facegave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression this shortman nodded to dolgorukov as to an intimate friend and stared at princeandrew with cool intensity walking straight toward him and evidentlyexpecting him to bow or to step out of his way prince andrew didneither a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other turnedaway and went down the side of the corridorwho was that asked borishe is one of the most remarkable but to me most unpleasant of mentheminister of foreign affairs prince adam czartoryski it is such menas he who decide the fate of nations added bolkonski with a sigh hecould not suppress as they passed out of the palacenext day the army began its campaign and up to the very battle ofausterlitz boris was unable to see either prince andrew or dolgorukovagain and remained for a while with the ismaylov regimentat dawn on the sixteenth of november denisovs squadron in whichnicholas rostov served and which was in prince bagrations detachmentmoved from the place where it had spent the night advancing into actionas arranged and after going behind other columns for about two thirdsof a mile was stopped on the highroad rostov saw the cossacks and thenthe first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions andartillery pass by and go forward and then generals bagration anddolgorukov ride past with their adjutants all the fear before actionwhich he had experienced as previously all the inner struggle toconquer that fear all his dreams of distinguishing himself as a truehussar in this battle had been wasted their squadron remained inreserve and nicholas rostov spent that day in a dull and wretched moodat nine in the morning he heard firing in front and shouts of hurrahand saw wounded being brought back there were not many of them and atlast he saw how a whole detachment of french cavalry was brought inconvoyed by a sotnya of cossacks evidently the affair was over andthough not big had been a successful engagement the men and officersreturning spoke of a brilliant victory of the occupation of the town ofwischau and the capture of a whole french squadron the day was brightand sunny after a sharp night frost and the cheerful glitter of thatautumn day was in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyednot only by the tales of those who had taken part in it but also by thejoyful expression on the faces of soldiers officers generals andadjutants as they passed rostov going or coming and nicholas who hadvainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent thathappy day in inactivity was all the more depressedcome here wostov lets dwink to dwown our gwief shouted denisovwho had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some foodthe officers gathered round denisovs canteen eating and talkingthere they are bringing another cried one of the officersindicating a captive french dragoon who was being brought in on foot bytwo cossacksone of them was leading by the bridle a fine large french horse he hadtaken from the prisonersell us that horse denisov called out to the cossacksif you like your honorthe officers got up and stood round the cossacks and their prisoner thefrench dragoon was a young alsatian who spoke french with a germanaccent he was breathless with agitation his face was red and when heheard some french spoken he at once began speaking to the officersaddressing first one then another he said he would not have beentaken it was not his fault but the corporals who had sent him to seizesome horsecloths though he had told him the russians were there and atevery word he added but dont hurt my little horse and stroked theanimal it was plain that he did not quite grasp where he was now heexcused himself for having been taken prisoner and now imagininghimself before his own officers insisted on his soldierly disciplineand zeal in the service he brought with him into our rearguard all thefreshness of atmosphere of the french army which was so alien to usthe cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces and rostov being therichest of the officers now that he had received his money bought itbut dont hurt my little horse said the alsatian goodnaturedly torostov when the animal was handed over to the hussarrostov smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him moneyalley alley said the cossack touching the prisoners arm to makehim go onthe emperor the emperor was suddenly heard among the hussarsall began to run and bustle and rostov saw coming up the road behindhim several riders with white plumes in their hats in a moment everyonewas in his place waitingrostov did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mountedinstantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected moodamid people of whom he was weary had gone instantly every thought ofhimself had vanished he was filled with happiness at his nearness tothe emperor he felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for theday he had lost he was happy as a lover when the longedfor moment ofmeeting arrives not daring to look round and without looking round hewas ecstatically conscious of his approach he felt it not only from thesound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade but because as he drewnear everything grew brighter more joyful more significant and morefestive around him nearer and nearer to rostov came that sun sheddingbeams of mild and majestic light around and already he felt himselfenveloped in those beams he heard his voice that kindly calm andmajestic voice that was yet so simple and as if in accord with rostovsfeeling there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard theemperors voicethe pavlograd hussars he inquiredthe reserves sire replied a voice a very human one compared to thatwhich had said the pavlograd hussarsthe emperor drew level with rostov and halted alexanders face was evenmore beautiful than it had been three days before at the review itshone with such gaiety and youth such innocent youth that it suggestedthe liveliness of a fourteenyearold boy and yet it was the face ofthe majestic emperor casually while surveying the squadron theemperors eyes met rostovs and rested on them for not more than twoseconds whether or no the emperor understood what was going on inrostovs soul it seemed to rostov that he understood everything atany rate his lightblue eyes gazed for about two seconds into rostovsface a gentle mild light poured from them then all at once he raisedhis eyebrows abruptly touched his horse with his left foot andgalloped onthe younger emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at thebattle and in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers at twelveoclock left the third column with which he had been and galloped towardthe vanguard before he came up with the hussars several adjutants methim with news of the successful result of the actionthis battle which consisted in the capture of a french squadron wasrepresented as a brilliant victory over the french and so the emperorand the whole army especially while the smoke hung over thebattlefield believed that the french had been defeated and wereretreating against their will a few minutes after the emperor hadpassed the pavlograd division was ordered to advance in wischauitself a petty german town rostov saw the emperor again in the marketplace where there had been some rather heavy firing before theemperors arrival lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom therehad not been time to move the emperor surrounded by his suite ofofficers and courtiers was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare adifferent one from that which he had ridden at the review and bendingto one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and lookedat a soldier who lay prone with blood on his uncovered head thewounded soldier was so dirty coarse and revolting that his proximityto the emperor shocked rostov rostov saw how the emperors rather roundshoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them how his leftfoot began convulsively tapping the horses side with the spur and howthe welltrained horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir anadjutant dismounting lifted the soldier under the arms to place him ona stretcher that had been brought the soldier groanedgently gently cant you do it more gently said the emperorapparently suffering more than the dying soldier and he rode awayrostov saw tears filling the emperors eyes and heard him as he wasriding away say to czartoryski what a terrible thing war is what aterrible thing quelle terrible chose que la guerrethe troops of the vanguard were stationed before wischau within sightof the enemys lines which all day long had yielded ground to us at theleast firing the emperors gratitude was announced to the vanguardrewards were promised and the men received a double ration of vodkathe campfires crackled and the soldiers songs resounded even moremerrily than on the previous night denisov celebrated his promotion tothe rank of major and rostov who had already drunk enough at the endof the feast proposed the emperors health not our sovereign theemperor as they say at official dinners said he but the health ofour sovereign that good enchanting and great man let us drink to hishealth and to the certain defeat of the frenchif we fought before he said not letting the french pass as atschon grabern what shall we not do now when he is at the front we willall die for him gladly is it not so gentlemen perhaps i am not sayingit right i have drunk a good dealbut that is how i feel and so doyou too to the health of alexander the first hurrahhurrah rang the enthusiastic voices of the officersand the old cavalry captain kirsten shouted enthusiastically and noless sincerely than the twentyyearold rostovwhen the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses kirsten filledothers and in shirt sleeves and breeches went glass in hand to thesoldiers bonfires and with his long gray mustache his white chestshowing under his open shirt he stood in a majestic pose in the lightof the campfire waving his uplifted armlads heres to our sovereign the emperor and victory over ourenemies hurrah he exclaimed in his dashing old hussars baritonethe hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shoutslate that night when all had separated denisov with his short handpatted his favorite rostov on the shoulderas theres no one to fall in love with on campaign hes fallen in lovewith the tsar he saiddenisov dont make fun of it cried rostov it is such a loftybeautiful feeling such ai believe it i believe it fwiend and i share and appwoveno you dont understandand rostov got up and went wandering among the campfires dreaming ofwhat happiness it would be to dienot in saving the emperors life hedid not even dare to dream of that but simply to die before his eyeshe really was in love with the tsar and the glory of the russian armsand the hope of future triumph and he was not the only man toexperience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battleof austerlitz nine tenths of the men in the russian army were then inlove though less ecstatically with their tsar and the glory of therussian armsthe next day the emperor stopped at wischau and villier his physicianwas repeatedly summoned to see him at headquarters and among the troopsnear by the news spread that the emperor was unwell he ate nothing andhad slept badly that night those around him reported the cause of thisindisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind bythe sight of the killed and woundedat daybreak on the seventeenth a french officer who had come with aflag of truce demanding an audience with the russian emperor wasbrought into wischau from our outposts this officer was savary theemperor had only just fallen asleep and so savary had to wait at middayhe was admitted to the emperor and an hour later he rode off withprince dolgorukov to the advanced post of the french armyit was rumored that savary had been sent to propose to alexander ameeting with napoleon to the joy and pride of the whole army apersonal interview was refused and instead of the sovereign princedolgorukov the victor at wischau was sent with savary to negotiatewith napoleon if contrary to expectations these negotiations wereactuated by a real desire for peacetoward evening dolgorukov came back went straight to the tsar andremained alone with him for a long timeon the eighteenth and nineteenth of november the army advanced twodays march and the enemys outposts after a brief interchange of shotsretreated in the highest army circles from midday on the nineteenth agreat excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till the morningof the twentieth when the memorable battle of austerlitz was foughttill midday on the nineteenth the activitythe eager talk running toand fro and dispatching of adjutantswas confined to the emperorsheadquarters but on the afternoon of that day this activity reachedkutuzovs headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns byevening the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the armyand in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth the whole eightythousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voicesand the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles longthe concentrated activity which had begun at the emperors headquartersin the morning and had started the whole movement that followed was likethe first movement of the main wheel of a large tower clock one wheelslowly moved another was set in motion and a third and wheels beganto revolve faster and faster levers and cogwheels to work chimes toplay figures to pop out and the hands to advance with regular motionas a result of all that activityjust as in the mechanism of a clock so in the mechanism of the militarymachine an impulse once given leads to the final result and just asindifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted tothem are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yetreached wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another andthe revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement but aneighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were preparedto remain so for a hundred years but the moment comes when the levercatches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joinsin the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its kenjust as in a clock the result of the complicated motion of innumerablewheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the handswhich show the time so the result of all the complicated humanactivities of  russians and frenchall their passions desiresremorse humiliations sufferings outbursts of pride fear andenthusiasmwas only the loss of the battle of austerlitz the socalledbattle of the three emperorsthat is to say a slow movement of thehand on the dial of human historyprince andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on thecommanderinchiefat six in the evening kutuzov went to the emperors headquarters andafter staying but a short time with the tsar went to see the grandmarshal of the court count tolstoybolkonski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of thecoming action from dolgorukov he felt that kutuzov was upset anddissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they weredissatisfied with him and also that at the emperors headquarterseveryone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others donot know he therefore wished to speak to dolgorukovwell how dyou do my dear fellow said dolgorukov who was sittingat tea with bilibin the fete is for tomorrow how is your old fellowout of sortsi wont say he is out of sorts but i fancy he would like to be heardbut they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when hetalks sense but to temporize and wait for something now when bonapartefears nothing so much as a general battle is impossibleyes you have seen him said prince andrew well what is bonapartelike how did he impress youyes i saw him and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as ageneral engagement repeated dolgorukov evidently prizing this generalconclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with napoleon ifhe werent afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview whynegotiate and above all why retreat when to retreat is so contrary tohis method of conducting war believe me he is afraid afraid of ageneral battle his hour has come mark my wordsbut tell me what is he like eh said prince andrew againhe is a man in a gray overcoat very anxious that i should call himyour majesty but who to his chagrin got no title from me thatsthe sort of man he is and nothing more replied dolgorukov lookinground at bilibin with a smiledespite my great respect for old kutuzov he continued we should bea nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him a chanceto escape or to trick us now that we certainly have him in our handsno we mustnt forget suvorov and his rulenot to put yourself in aposition to be attacked but yourself to attack believe me in war theenergy of young men often shows the way better than all the experienceof old cunctatorsbut in what position are we going to attack him i have been at theoutposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces aresituated said prince andrewhe wished to explain to dolgorukov a plan of attack he had himselfformedoh that is all the same dolgorukov said quickly and getting up hespread a map on the table all eventualities have been foreseen if heis standing before brunnand prince dolgorukov rapidly but indistinctly explained weyrothersplan of a flanking movementprince andrew began to reply and to state his own plan which might havebeen as good as weyrothers but for the disadvantage that weyrothershad already been approved as soon as prince andrew began to demonstratethe defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan princedolgorukov ceased to listen to him and gazed absentmindedly not at themap but at prince andrews facethere will be a council of war at kutuzovs tonight though you cansay all this there remarked dolgorukovi will do so said prince andrew moving away from the mapwhatever are you bothering about gentlemen said bilibin who tillthen had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and nowwas evidently ready with a joke whether tomorrow brings victory ordefeat the glory of our russian arms is secure except your kutuzovthere is not a single russian in command of a column the commandersare herr general wimpfen le comte de langeron le prince delichtenstein le prince de hohenlohe and finally prishprish and so onlike all those polish namesbe quiet backbiter said dolgorukov it is not true there are nowtwo russians miloradovich and dokhturov and there would be a thirdcount arakcheev if his nerves were not too weakhowever i think general kutuzov has come out said prince andrew iwish you good luck and success gentlemen he added and went out aftershaking hands with dolgorukov and bilibinon the way home prince andrew could not refrain from asking kutuzovwho was sitting silently beside him what he thought of tomorrowsbattlekutuzov looked sternly at his adjutant and after a pause replied ithink the battle will be lost and so i told count tolstoy and asked himto tell the emperor what do you think he replied but my deargeneral i am engaged with rice and cutlets look after military mattersyourself yes that was the answer i gotshortly after nine oclock that evening weyrother drove with his plansto kutuzovs quarters where the council of war was to be held all thecommanders of columns were summoned to the commanderinchiefs and withthe exception of prince bagration who declined to come were all thereat the appointed timeweyrother who was in full control of the proposed battle by hiseagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfiedand drowsy kutuzov who reluctantly played the part of chairman andpresident of the council of war weyrother evidently felt himself to beat the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable he waslike a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart whether he waspulling it or being pushed by it he did not know but rushed along atheadlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might leadto weyrother had been twice that evening to the enemys picket line toreconnoiter personally and twice to the emperors russian and austrianto report and explain and to his headquarters where he had dictated thedispositions in german and now much exhausted he arrived atkutuzovshe was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to thecommander in chief he interrupted him talked rapidly and indistinctlywithout looking at the man he was addressing and did not reply toquestions put to him he was bespattered with mud and had a pitifulweary and distracted air though at the same time he was haughty andselfconfidentkutuzov was occupying a noblemans castle of modest dimensions nearostralitz in the large drawing room which had become the commander inchiefs office were gathered kutuzov himself weyrother and the membersof the council of war they were drinking tea and only awaited princebagration to begin the council at last bagrations orderly came withthe news that the prince could not attend prince andrew came in toinform the commanderinchief of this and availing himself ofpermission previously given him by kutuzov to be present at the councilhe remained in the roomsince prince bagration is not coming we may begin said weyrotherhurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on which anenormous map of the environs of brunn was spread outkutuzov with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged overhis collar as if escaping was sitting almost asleep in a low chairwith his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms at the soundof weyrothers voice he opened his one eye with an effortyes yes if you please it is already late said he and nodding hishead he let it droop and again closed his eyeif at first the members of the council thought that kutuzov waspretending to sleep the sounds his nose emitted during the reading thatfollowed proved that the commanderinchief at that moment was absorbedby a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for thedispositions or anything elsehe was engaged in satisfying theirresistible human need for sleep he really was asleep weyrother withthe gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment glanced at kutuzov andhaving convinced himself that he was asleep took up a paper and in aloud monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for theimpending battle under a heading which he also read outdispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind kobelnitz andsokolnitz november  the dispositions were very complicated and difficult they began asfollowsas the enemys left wing rests on wooded hills and his right extendsalong kobelnitz and sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there while weon the other hand with our left wing by far outflank his right it isadvantageous to attack the enemys latter wing especially if we occupythe villages of sokolnitz and kobelnitz whereby we can both fall on hisflank and pursue him over the plain between schlappanitz and thethuerassa forest avoiding the defiles of schlappanitz and bellowitzwhich cover the enemys front for this object it is necessary thatthe first column marches the second column marches the thirdcolumn marches and so on read weyrotherthe generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositionsthe tall fairhaired general buxhowden stood leaning his back againstthe wall his eyes fixed on a burning candle and seemed not to listenor even to wish to be thought to listen exactly opposite weyrotherwith his glistening wideopen eyes fixed upon him and his mustachetwisted upwards sat the ruddy miloradovich in a military pose hiselbows turned outwards his hands on his knees and his shouldersraised he remained stubbornly silent gazing at weyrothers face andonly turned away his eyes when the austrian chief of staff finishedreading then miloradovich looked round significantly at the othergenerals but one could not tell from that significant look whether heagreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements nextto weyrother sat count langeron who with a subtle smile that never lefthis typically southern french face during the whole time of the readinggazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners agold snuffbox on which was a portrait in the middle of one of thelongest sentences he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox raisedhis head and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of histhin lips interrupted weyrother wishing to say something but theaustrian general continuing to read frowned angrily and jerked hiselbows as if to say you can tell me your views later but now be sogood as to look at the map and listen langeron lifted his eyes with anexpression of perplexity turned round to miloradovich as if seeking anexplanation but meeting the latters impressive but meaningless gazedrooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffboxa geography lesson he muttered as if to himself but loud enough tobe heardprzebyszewski with respectful but dignified politeness held his handto his ear toward weyrother with the air of a man absorbed inattention dohkturov a little man sat opposite weyrother with anassiduous and modest mien and stooping over the outspread mapconscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality heasked weyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly heardand the difficult names of villages weyrother complied and dohkturovnoted them downwhen the reading which lasted more than an hour was over langeron againbrought his snuffbox to rest and without looking at weyrother or atanyone in particular began to say how difficult it was to carry outsuch a plan in which the enemys position was assumed to be knownwhereas it was perhaps not known since the enemy was in movementlangerons objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief aimwas to show general weyrotherwho had read his dispositions with asmuch selfconfidence as if he were addressing school childrenthat hehad to do not with fools but with men who could teach him something inmilitary matterswhen the monotonous sound of weyrothers voice ceased kutuzov openedhis eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheelis interrupted he listened to what langeron said as if remarking soyou are still at that silly business quickly closed his eye again andlet his head sink still lowerlangeron trying as virulently as possible to sting weyrothers vanityas author of the military plan argued that bonaparte might easilyattack instead of being attacked and so render the whole of this planperfectly worthless weyrother met all objections with a firm andcontemptuous smile evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objectionsbe they what they mightif he could attack us he would have done so today said heso you think he is powerless said langeronhe has forty thousand men at most replied weyrother with the smileof a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of acasein that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack saidlangeron with a subtly ironical smile again glancing round for supportto miloradovich who was near himbut miloradovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anythingrather than of what the generals were disputing aboutma foi said he tomorrow we shall see all that on the battlefieldweyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it wasstrange and ridiculous to meet objections from russian generals and tohave to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of buthad also convinced the sovereign emperors ofthe enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard fromhis camp said he what does that mean either he is retreating whichis the only thing we need fear or he is changing his position hesmiled ironically but even if he also took up a position in thethuerassa he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all ourarrangements to the minutest detail remain the samehow is that began prince andrew who had for long been waiting anopportunity to express his doubtskutuzov here woke up coughed heavily and looked round at the generalsgentlemen the dispositions for tomorrowor rather for today for itis past midnightcannot now be altered said he you have heard themand we shall all do our duty but before a battle there is nothing moreimportant he paused than to have a good sleephe moved as if to rise the generals bowed and retired it was pastmidnight prince andrew went outthe council of war at which prince andrew had not been able to expresshis opinion as he had hoped to left on him a vague and uneasyimpression whether dolgorukov and weyrother or kutuzov langeron andthe others who did not approve of the plan of attack were righthe didnot know but was it really not possible for kutuzov to state his viewsplainly to the emperor is it possible that on account of court andpersonal considerations tens of thousands of lives and my life mylife he thought must be riskedyes it is very likely that i shall be killed tomorrow he thoughtand suddenly at this thought of death a whole series of most distantmost intimate memories rose in his imagination he remembered his lastparting from his father and his wife he remembered the days when hefirst loved her he thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her andfor himself and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he went outof the hut in which he was billeted with nesvitski and began to walk upand down before itthe night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamedmysteriously yes tomorrow tomorrow he thought tomorroweverything may be over for me all these memories will be no more noneof them will have any meaning for me tomorrow perhaps even certainlyi have a presentiment that for the first time i shall have to show all ican do and his fancy pictured the battle its loss the concentrationof fighting at one point and the hesitation of all the commanders andthen that happy moment that toulon for which he had so long waitedpresents itself to him at last he firmly and clearly expresses hisopinion to kutuzov to weyrother and to the emperors all are struck bythe justness of his views but no one undertakes to carry them out sohe takes a regiment a divisionstipulates that no one is to interferewith his arrangementsleads his division to the decisive point andgains the victory alone but death and suffering suggested anothervoice prince andrew however did not answer that voice and went ondreaming of his triumphs the dispositions for the next battle areplanned by him alone nominally he is only an adjutant on kutuzovsstaff but he does everything alone the next battle is won by himalone kutuzov is removed and he is appointed well and then askedthe other voice if before that you are not ten times wounded killedor betrayed well what then well then prince andrew answeredhimself i dont know what will happen and dont want to know andcant but if i want thiswant glory want to be known to men want tobe loved by them it is not my fault that i want it and want nothing butthat and live only for that yes for that alone i shall never tellanyone but oh god what am i to do if i love nothing but fame andmens esteem death wounds the loss of familyi fear nothing andprecious and dear as many persons are to mefather sister wifethosedearest to meyet dreadful and unnatural as it seems i would give themall at once for a moment of glory of triumph over men of love from meni dont know and never shall know for the love of these men here hethought as he listened to voices in kutuzovs courtyard the voiceswere those of the orderlies who were packing up one voice probably acoachmans was teasing kutuzovs old cook whom prince andrew knew andwho was called tit he was saying tit i say titwell returned the old mango tit thresh a bit said the wagoh go to the devil called out a voice drowned by the laughter ofthe orderlies and servantsall the same i love and value nothing but triumph over them all ivalue this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in thismistthat same night rostov was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in frontof bagrations detachment his hussars were placed along the line incouples and he himself rode along the line trying to master thesleepiness that kept coming over him an enormous space with our armyscampfires dimly glowing in the fog could be seen behind him in frontof him was misty darkness rostov could see nothing peer as he wouldinto that foggy distance now something gleamed gray now there wassomething black now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemyought to be now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes hiseyes kept closing and in his fancy appearednow the emperor nowdenisov and now moscow memoriesand he again hurriedly opened his eyesand saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was ridingand sometimes when he came within six paces of them the black figuresof hussars but in the distance was still the same misty darkness whynot it might easily happen thought rostov that the emperor willmeet me and give me an order as he would to any other officer hellsay go and find out whats there there are many stories of hisgetting to know an officer in just such a chance way and attaching himto himself what if he gave me a place near him oh how i would guardhim how i would tell him the truth how i would unmask his deceiversand in order to realize vividly his love devotion to the sovereignrostov pictured to himself an enemy or a deceitful german whom he wouldnot only kill with pleasure but whom he would slap in the face beforethe emperor suddenly a distant shout aroused him he started and openedhis eyeswhere am i oh yes in the skirmishing line pass and watchwordshaft olmutz what a nuisance that our squadron will be in reservetomorrow he thought ill ask leave to go to the front this may bemy only chance of seeing the emperor it wont be long now before i amoff duty ill take another turn and when i get back ill go to thegeneral and ask him he readjusted himself in the saddle and touched uphis horse to ride once more round his hussars it seemed to him that itwas getting lighter to the left he saw a sloping descent lit up andfacing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a wall on this knollthere was a white patch that rostov could not at all make out was it aglade in the wood lit up by the moon or some unmelted snow or somewhite houses he even thought something moved on that white spot iexpect its snow that spot a spotune tache he thought therenow its not a tache natasha sister black eyes natasha wont she be surprised when i tell her how ive seen theemperor natasha take my sabretachekeep to the right yourhonor there are bushes here came the voice of an hussar past whomrostov was riding in the act of falling asleep rostov lifted his headthat had sunk almost to his horses mane and pulled up beside thehussar he was succumbing to irresistible youthful childishdrowsiness but what was i thinking i mustnt forget how shall ispeak to the emperor no thats not itthats tomorrow oh yesnatasha sabretache saber them whom the hussars ah thehussars with mustaches along the tverskaya street rode the hussar withmustaches i thought about him too just opposite guryevs houseold guryev oh but denisovs a fine fellow but thats all nonsensethe chief thing is that the emperor is here how he looked at me andwished to say something but dared not no it was i who dared notbut thats nonsense the chief thing is not to forget the importantthing i was thinking of yes natasha sabretache oh yes yes thatsright and his head once more sank to his horses neck all at once itseemed to him that he was being fired at what what what cut themdown what said rostov waking up at the moment he opened his eyeshe heard in front of him where the enemy was the longdrawn shouts ofthousands of voices his horse and the horse of the hussar near himpricked their ears at these shouts over there where the shouting camefrom a fire flared up and went out again then another and all alongthe french line on the hill fires flared up and the shouting grew louderand louder rostov could hear the sound of french words but could notdistinguish them the din of many voices was too great all he couldhear was ahahah and rrrrwhats that what do you make of it said rostov to the hussar besidehim that must be the enemys campthe hussar did not replywhy dont you hear it rostov asked again after waiting for a replywho can tell your honor replied the hussar reluctantlyfrom the direction it must be the enemy repeated rostovit may be he or it may be nothing muttered the hussar its darksteady he cried to his fidgeting horserostovs horse was also getting restive it pawed the frozen groundpricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights the shoutinggrew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army ofseveral thousand men could produce the lights spread farther andfarther probably along the line of the french camp rostov no longerwanted to sleep the gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had astimulating effect on him vive lempereur lempereur he now hearddistinctlythey cant be far off probably just beyond the stream he said to thehussar beside himthe hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily the soundof horses hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars washeard and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussarssuddenly appeared looming huge as an elephantyour honor the generals said the sergeant riding up to rostovrostov still looking round toward the fires and the shouts rode withthe sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the lineone was on a white horse prince bagration and prince dolgorukov withtheir adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the lightsand shouts in the enemys camp rostov rode up to bagration reported tohim and then joined the adjutants listening to what the generals weresayingbelieve me said prince dolgorukov addressing bagration it isnothing but a trick he has retreated and ordered the rearguard tokindle fires and make a noise to deceive ushardly said bagration i saw them this evening on that knoll ifthey had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too officersaid bagration to rostov are the enemys skirmishers still therethey were there this evening but now i dont know your excellencyshall i go with some of my hussars to see replied rostovbagration stopped and before replying tried to see rostovs face inthe mistwell go and see he said after a pauseyes sirrostov spurred his horse called to sergeant fedchenko and two otherhussars told them to follow him and trotted downhill in the directionfrom which the shouting came he felt both frightened and pleased to beriding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous mistydistance where no one had been before him bagration called to him fromthe hill not to go beyond the stream but rostov pretended not to hearhim and did not stop but rode on and on continually mistaking bushesfor trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakeshaving descended the hill at a trot he no longer saw either our own orthe enemys fires but heard the shouting of the french more loudly anddistinctly in the valley he saw before him something like a river butwhen he reached it he found it was a road having come out onto the roadhe reined in his horse hesitating whether to ride along it or cross itand ride over the black field up the hillside to keep to the road whichgleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it would beeasier to see people coming along it follow me said he crossed theroad and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the point wherethe french pickets had been standing that eveningyour honor there he is cried one of the hussars behind him andbefore rostov had time to make out what the black thing was that hadsuddenly appeared in the fog there was a flash followed by a reportand a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passedout of hearing another musket missed fire but flashed in the panrostov turned his horse and galloped back four more reports followed atintervals and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing indifferent tones rostov reined in his horse whose spirits had risenlike his own at the firing and went back at a footpace well somemore some more a merry voice was saying in his soul but no moreshots cameonly when approaching bagration did rostov let his horse gallop againand with his hand at the salute rode up to the generaldolgorukov was still insisting that the french had retreated and hadonly lit fires to deceive uswhat does that prove he was saying as rostov rode up they mightretreat and leave the picketsits plain that they have not all gone yet prince said bagrationwait till tomorrow morning well find out everything tomorrowthe picket is still on the hill your excellency just where it was inthe evening reported rostov stooping forward with his hand at thesalute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his rideand especially by the sound of the bulletsvery good very good said bagration thank you officeryour excellency said rostov may i ask a favorwhat is ittomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve may i ask to be attached tothe first squadronwhats your namecount rostovoh very well you may stay in attendance on mecount ilya rostovs son asked dolgorukovbut rostov did not replythen i may reckon on it your excellencyi will give the ordertomorrow very likely i may be sent with some message to the emperorthought rostovthank godthe fires and shouting in the enemys army were occasioned by the factthat while napoleons proclamation was being read to the troops theemperor himself rode round his bivouacs the soldiers on seeing himlit wisps of straw and ran after him shouting vive lempereurnapoleons proclamation was as followssoldiers the russian army is advancing against you to avenge theaustrian army of ulm they are the same battalions you broke athollabrunn and have pursued ever since to this place the position weoccupy is a strong one and while they are marching to go round me onthe right they will expose a flank to me soldiers i will myself directyour battalions i will keep out of fire if you with your habitual valorcarry disorder and confusion into the enemys ranks but should victorybe in doubt even for a moment you will see your emperor exposinghimself to the first blows of the enemy for there must be no doubt ofvictory especially on this day when what is at stake is the honor ofthe french infantry so necessary to the honor of our nationdo not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded let everyman be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelingsof england inspired by such hatred of our nation this victory willconclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters where freshfrench troops who are being raised in france will join us and the peacei shall conclude will be worthy of my people of you and of myselfnapoleonat five in the morning it was still quite dark the troops of thecenter the reserves and bagrations right flank had not yet moved buton the left flank the columns of infantry cavalry and artillery whichwere to be the first to descend the heights to attack the french rightflank and drive it into the bohemian mountains according to plan werealready up and astir the smoke of the campfires into which they werethrowing everything superfluous made the eyes smart it was cold anddark the officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting thesoldiers munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to warmthemselves gathering round the fires throwing into the flames theremains of sheds chairs tables wheels tubs and everything that theydid not want or could not carry away with them austrian column guideswere moving in and out among the russian troops and served as heralds ofthe advance as soon as an austrian officer showed himself near acommanding officers quarters the regiment began to move the soldiersran from the fires thrust their pipes into their boots their bags intothe carts got their muskets ready and formed rank the officersbuttoned up their coats buckled on their swords and pouches and movedalong the ranks shouting the train drivers and orderlies harnessed andpacked the wagons and tied on the loads the adjutants and battalion andregimental commanders mounted crossed themselves gave finalinstructions orders and commissions to the baggage men who remainedbehind and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet resounded thecolumn moved forward without knowing where and unable from the massesaround them the smoke and the increasing fog to see either the placethey were leaving or that to which they were goinga soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment asmuch as a sailor is by his ship however far he has walked whateverstrange unknown and dangerous places he reaches just as a sailor isalways surrounded by the same decks masts and rigging of his ship sothe soldier always has around him the same comrades the same ranks thesame sergeant major ivan mitrich the same company dog jack and thesame commanders the sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in whichhis ship is sailing but on the day of battleheaven knows how andwhencea stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moralatmosphere of an army announcing the approach of something decisive andsolemn and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity on the day ofbattle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of theirregiment they listen intently look about and eagerly ask concerningwhat is going on around themthe fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they couldnot see ten paces ahead bushes looked like gigantic trees and levelground like cliffs and slopes anywhere on any side one mightencounter an enemy invisible ten paces off but the columns advanced fora long time always in the same fog descending and ascending hillsavoiding gardens and enclosures going over new and unknown ground andnowhere encountering the enemy on the contrary the soldiers becameaware that in front behind and on all sides other russian columnswere moving in the same direction every soldier felt glad to know thatto the unknown place where he was going many more of our men were goingtoothere now the kurskies have also gone past was being said in theranksits wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered lads last nighti looked at the campfires and there was no end of them a regularmoscowthough none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked tothe men the commanders as we saw at the council of war were out ofhumor and dissatisfied with the affair and so did not exert themselvesto cheer the men but merely carried out the orders yet the troopsmarched gaily as they always do when going into action especially toan attack but when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fogthe greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousnessof some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks how such aconsciousness is communicated is very difficult to define but itcertainly is communicated very surely and flows rapidly imperceptiblyand irrepressibly as water does in a creek had the russian army beenalone without any allies it might perhaps have been a long time beforethis consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction but asit was the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupidgermans and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had beenoccasioned by the sausage eaterswhy have we stopped is the way blocked or have we already come upagainst the frenchno one cant hear them theyd be firing if we hadthey were in a hurry enough to start us and now here we stand in themiddle of a field without rhyme or reason its all those damnedgermans muddling what stupid devilsyes id send them on in front but no fear theyre crowding upbehind and now here we stand hungryi say shall we soon be clear they say the cavalry are blocking theway said an officerah those damned germans they dont know their own country saidanotherwhat division are you shouted an adjutant riding upthe eighteenththen why are you here you should have gone on long ago now you wontget there till eveningwhat stupid orders they dont themselves know what they are doingsaid the officer and rode offthen a general rode past shouting something angrily not in russiantafalafa but what hes jabbering no one can make out said asoldier mimicking the general who had ridden away id shoot them thescoundrelswe were ordered to be at the place before nine but we havent gothalfway fine orders was being repeated on different sidesand the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began toturn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at thegermansthe cause of the confusion was that while the austrian cavalry wasmoving toward our left flank the higher command found that our centerwas too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were allordered to turn back to the right several thousand cavalry crossed infront of the infantry who had to waitat the front an altercation occurred between an austrian guide and arussian general the general shouted a demand that the cavalry should behalted the austrian argued that not he but the higher command was toblame the troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited afteran hours delay they at last moved on descending the hill the fog thatwas dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below where they weredescending in front in the fog a shot was heard and then another atfirst irregularly at varying intervalstrata tatand then more andmore regularly and rapidly and the action at the goldbach stream begannot expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream and havingstumbled on him in the fog hearing no encouraging word from theircommanders and with a consciousness of being too late spreading throughthe ranks and above all being unable to see anything in front or aroundthem in the thick fog the russians exchanged shots with the enemylazily and advanced and again halted receiving no timely orders fromthe officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknownsurroundings unable to find their own regiments in this way the actionbegan for the first second and third columns which had gone down intothe valley the fourth column with which kutuzov was stood on thepratzen heightsbelow where the fight was beginning there was still thick fog on thehigher ground it was clearing but nothing could be seen of what wasgoing on in front whether all the enemy forces were as we supposedsix miles away or whether they were near by in that sea of mist no oneknew till after eight oclockit was nine oclock in the morning the fog lay unbroken like a sea downbelow but higher up at the village of schlappanitz where napoleon stoodwith his marshals around him it was quite light above him was a clearblue sky and the suns vast orb quivered like a huge hollow crimsonfloat on the surface of that milky sea of mist the whole french armyand even napoleon himself with his staff were not on the far side ofthe streams and hollows of sokolnitz and schlappanitz beyond which weintended to take up our position and begin the action but were on thisside so close to our own forces that napoleon with the naked eye coulddistinguish a mounted man from one on foot napoleon in the blue cloakwhich he had worn on his italian campaign sat on his small gray arabhorse a little in front of his marshals he gazed silently at the hillswhich seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the russiantroops were moving in the distance and he listened to the sounds offiring in the valley not a single muscle of his facewhich in thosedays was still thinmoved his gleaming eyes were fixed intently on onespot his predictions were being justified part of the russian forcehad already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes andpart were leaving these pratzen heights which he intended to attack andregarded as the key to the position he saw over the mist that in ahollow between two hills near the village of pratzen the russiancolumns their bayonets glittering were moving continuously in onedirection toward the valley and disappearing one after another into themist from information he had received the evening before from thesound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night bythe disorderly movement of the russian columns and from allindications he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far awayin front of them and that the columns moving near pratzen constitutedthe center of the russian army and that that center was alreadysufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked but still he did notbegin the engagementtoday was a great day for himthe anniversary of his coronation beforedawn he had slept for a few hours and refreshed vigorous and in goodspirits he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in that happymood in which everything seems possible and everything succeeds he satmotionless looking at the heights visible above the mist and his coldface wore that special look of confident selfcomplacent happiness thatone sees on the face of a boy happily in love the marshals stood behindhim not venturing to distract his attention he looked now at thepratzen heights now at the sun floating up out of the mistwhen the sun had entirely emerged from the fog and fields and mist wereaglow with dazzling lightas if he had only awaited this to begin theactionhe drew the glove from his shapely white hand made a sign withit to the marshals and ordered the action to begin the marshalsaccompanied by adjutants galloped off in different directions and afew minutes later the chief forces of the french army moved rapidlytoward those pratzen heights which were being more and more denuded byrussian troops moving down the valley to their leftat eight oclock kutuzov rode to pratzen at the head of the fourthcolumn miloradovichs the one that was to take the place ofprzebyszewskis and langerons columns which had already gone down intothe valley he greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave themthe order to march thereby indicating that he intended to lead thatcolumn himself when he had reached the village of pratzen he haltedprince andrew was behind among the immense number forming thecommanderinchiefs suite he was in a state of suppressed excitementand irritation though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach ofa longawaited moment he was firmly convinced that this was the day ofhis toulon or his bridge of arcola how it would come about he did notknow but he felt sure it would do so the locality and the position ofour troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyone inour army his own strategic plan which obviously could not now becarried out was forgotten now entering into weyrothers plan princeandrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects such asmight call for his rapidity of perception and decisionto the left down below in the mist the musketry fire of unseen forcescould be heard it was there prince andrew thought the fight wouldconcentrate there we shall encounter difficulties and there thoughthe i shall be sent with a brigade or division and there standard inhand i shall go forward and break whatever is in front of mehe could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalionsseeing them he kept thinking that may be the very standard with whichi shall lead the armyin the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was ahoar frost now turning to dew but in the valleys it still lay like amilkwhite sea nothing was visible in the valley to the left into whichour troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firingabove the heights was the dark clear sky and to the right the vast orbof the sun in front far off on the farther shore of that sea of mistsome wooded hills were discernible and it was there the enemy probablywas for something could be descried on the right the guards wereentering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now andthen a gleam of bayonets to the left beyond the village similar massesof cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist in front andbehind moved infantry the commanderinchief was standing at the end ofthe village letting the troops pass by him that morning kutuzov seemedworn and irritable the infantry passing before him came to a haltwithout any command being given apparently obstructed by something infrontdo order them to form into battalion columns and go round the villagehe said angrily to a general who had ridden up dont you understandyour excellency my dear sir that you must not defile through narrowvillage streets when we are marching against the enemyi intended to reform them beyond the village your excellencyanswered the generalkutuzov laughed bitterlyyoull make a fine thing of it deploying in sight of the enemy veryfinethe enemy is still far away your excellency according to thedispositionsthe dispositions exclaimed kutuzov bitterly who told you thatkindly do as you are orderedyes sirmy dear fellow nesvitski whispered to prince andrew the old man isas surly as a dogan austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hatgalloped up to kutuzov and asked in the emperors name had the fourthcolumn advanced into actionkutuzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall uponprince andrew who was beside him seeing him kutuzovs malevolent andcaustic expression softened as if admitting that what was being donewas not his adjutants fault and still not answering the austrianadjutant he addressed bolkonskigo my dear fellow and see whether the third division has passed thevillage tell it to stop and await my ordershardly had prince andrew started than he stopped himand ask whether sharpshooters have been posted he added what arethey doing what are they doing he murmured to himself still notreplying to the austrianprince andrew galloped off to execute the orderovertaking the battalions that continued to advance he stopped thethird division and convinced himself that there really were nosharpshooters in front of our columns the colonel at the head of theregiment was much surprised at the commanderinchiefs order to throwout skirmishers he had felt perfectly sure that there were other troopsin front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles awaythere was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descenthidden by dense mist having given orders in the commanderinchiefsname to rectify this omission prince andrew galloped back kutuzovstill in the same place his stout body resting heavily in the saddlewith the lassitude of age sat yawning wearily with closed eyes thetroops were no longer moving but stood with the butts of their musketson the groundall right all right he said to prince andrew and turned to ageneral who watch in hand was saying it was time they started as allthe leftflank columns had already descendedplenty of time your excellency muttered kutuzov in the midst of ayawn plenty of time he repeatedjust then at a distance behind kutuzov was heard the sound of regimentssaluting and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extendedline of the advancing russian columns evidently the person they weregreeting was riding quickly when the soldiers of the regiment in frontof which kutuzov was standing began to shout he rode a little to oneside and looked round with a frown along the road from pratzen gallopedwhat looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms two of themrode side by side in front at full gallop one in a black uniform withwhite plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse the other whowas in a white uniform rode a black one these were the two emperorsfollowed by their suites kutuzov affecting the manners of an oldsoldier at the front gave the command attention and rode up to theemperors with a salute his whole appearance and manner were suddenlytransformed he put on the air of a subordinate who obeys withoutreasoning with an affectation of respect which evidently struckalexander unpleasantly he rode up and salutedthis unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy faceof the emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanishedafter his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field ofolmutz where bolkonski had seen him for the first time abroad but therewas still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness in hisfine gray eyes and on his delicate lips the same capacity for varyingexpression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocentyouthat the olmutz review he had seemed more majestic here he seemedbrighter and more energetic he was slightly flushed after galloping twomiles and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round atthe faces of his suite young and animated as his own czartoryskinovosiltsev prince volkonsky strogonov and the others all richlydressed gay young men on splendid wellgroomed fresh only slightlyheated horses exchanging remarks and smiling had stopped behind theemperor the emperor francis a rosy long faced young man sat veryerect on his handsome black horse looking about him in a leisurely andpreoccupied manner he beckoned to one of his white adjutants and askedsome questionmost likely he is asking at what oclock they startedthought prince andrew watching his old acquaintance with a smile hecould not repress as he recalled his reception at brunn in theemperors suite were the picked young orderly officers of the guard andline regiments russian and austrian among them were grooms leading thetsars beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered clothsas when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters astuffy room so a whiff of youthfulness energy and confidence ofsuccess reached kutuzovs cheerless staff with the galloping advent ofall these brilliant young menwhy arent you beginning michael ilarionovich said the emperoralexander hurriedly to kutuzov glancing courteously at the same time atthe emperor francisi am waiting your majesty answered kutuzov bending forwardrespectfullythe emperor frowning slightly bent his ear forward as if he had notquite heardwaiting your majesty repeated kutuzov prince andrew noted thatkutuzovs upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the word waitingnot all the columns have formed up yet your majestythe tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply he shrugged hisrather round shoulders and glanced at novosiltsev who was near him asif complaining of kutuzovyou know michael ilarionovich we are not on the empress field wherea parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled said thetsar with another glance at the emperor francis as if inviting him ifnot to join in at least to listen to what he was saying but the emperorfrancis continued to look about him and did not listenthat is just why i do not begin sire said kutuzov in a resoundingvoice apparently to preclude the possibility of not being heard andagain something in his face twitchedthat is just why i do not beginsire because we are not on parade and not on the empress field saidclearly and distinctlyin the emperors suite all exchanged rapid looks that expresseddissatisfaction and reproach old though he may be he should not hecertainly should not speak like that their glances seemed to saythe tsar looked intently and observantly into kutuzovs eye waiting tohear whether he would say anything more but kutuzov with respectfullybowed head seemed also to be waiting the silence lasted for about aminutehowever if you command it your majesty said kutuzov lifting hishead and again assuming his former tone of a dull unreasoning butsubmissive generalhe touched his horse and having called miloradovich the commander ofthe column gave him the order to advancethe troops again began to move and two battalions of the novgorod andone of the apsheron regiment went forward past the emperoras this apsheron battalion marched by the redfaced miloradovichwithout his greatcoat with his orders on his breast and an enormoustuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners frontand back galloped strenuously forward and with a dashing salute reinedin his horse before the emperorgod be with you general said the emperorma foi sire nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilite sire he answered gaily raising nevertheless ironic smiles among thegentlemen of the tsars suite by his poor french indeed sire we shall do everything it is possible to do siremiloradovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a littlebehind the emperor the apsheron men excited by the tsars presencepassed in step before the emperors and their suites at a bold briskpacelads shouted miloradovich in a loud selfconfident and cheeryvoice obviously so elated by the sound of firing by the prospect ofbattle and by the sight of the gallant apsherons his comrades insuvorovs time now passing so gallantly before the emperors that heforgot the sovereigns presence lads its not the first villageyouve had to take cried heglad to do our best shouted the soldiersthe emperors horse started at the sudden cry this horse that hadcarried the sovereign at reviews in russia bore him also here on thefield of austerlitz enduring the heedless blows of his left foot andpricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on theempress field not understanding the significance of the firing nor ofthe nearness of the emperor francis black cob nor of all that wasbeing said thought and felt that day by its riderthe emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made aremark to him pointing to the gallant apsheronskutuzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind thecarabineerswhen he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column hestopped at a solitary deserted house that had probably once been aninn where two roads parted both of them led downhill and troops weremarching along boththe fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visibleabout a mile and a half off on the opposite heights down below on theleft the firing became more distinct kutuzov had stopped and wasspeaking to an austrian general prince andrew who was a little behindlooking at them turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glasslook look said this adjutant looking not at the troops in thedistance but down the hill before him its the frenchthe two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass tryingto snatch it from one another the expression on all their facessuddenly changed to one of horror the french were supposed to be a mileand a half away but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just infront of usits the enemy no yes see it is for certain but how isthat said different voiceswith the naked eye prince andrew saw below them to the right not morethan five hundred paces from where kutuzov was standing a dense frenchcolumn coming up to meet the apsheronshere it is the decisive moment has arrived my turn has come thoughtprince andrew and striking his horse he rode up to kutuzovthe apsherons must be stopped your excellency cried he but at thatvery instant a cloud of smoke spread all round firing was heard quiteclose at hand and a voice of naive terror barely two steps from princeandrew shouted brothers alls lost and at this as if at a commandeveryone began to runconfused and everincreasing crowds were running back to where fiveminutes before the troops had passed the emperors not only would ithave been difficult to stop that crowd it was even impossible not to becarried back with it oneself bolkonski only tried not to lose touchwith it and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what washappening in front of him nesvitski with an angry face red and unlikehimself was shouting to kutuzov that if he did not ride away at once hewould certainly be taken prisoner kutuzov remained in the same placeand without answering drew out a handkerchief blood was flowing fromhis cheek prince andrew forced his way to himyou are wounded he asked hardly able to master the trembling of hislower jawthe wound is not here it is there said kutuzov pressing thehandkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiersstop them he shouted and at the same moment probably realizing thatit was impossible to stop them spurred his horse and rode to the righta fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with itthe troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded bythem it was difficult to get out again one was shouting get on whyare you hindering us another in the same place turned round and firedin the air a third was striking the horse kutuzov himself rode havingby a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men kutuzovwith his suite diminished by more than half rode toward a sound ofartillery fire near by having forced his way out of the crowd offugitives prince andrew trying to keep near kutuzov saw on the slopeof the hill amid the smoke a russian battery that was still firing andfrenchmen running toward it higher up stood some russian infantryneither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with thefleeing crowd a mounted general separated himself from the infantry andapproached kutuzov of kutuzovs suite only four remained they were allpale and exchanged looks in silencestop those wretches gasped kutuzov to the regimental commanderpointing to the flying soldiers but at that instant as if to punishhim for those words bullets flew hissing across the regiment and acrosskutuzovs suite like a flock of little birdsthe french had attacked the battery and seeing kutuzov were firing athim after this volley the regimental commander clutched at his legseveral soldiers fell and a second lieutenant who was holding the flaglet it fall from his hands it swayed and fell but caught on themuskets of the nearest soldiers the soldiers started firing withoutordersoh oh oh groaned kutuzov despairingly and looked aroundbolkonski he whispered his voice trembling from a consciousness ofthe feebleness of age bolkonski he whispered pointing to thedisordered battalion and at the enemy whats thatbut before he had finished speaking prince andrew feeling tears ofshame and anger choking him had already leapt from his horse and run tothe standardforward lads he shouted in a voice piercing as a childshere it is thought he seizing the staff of the standard and hearingwith pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him severalsoldiers fellhurrah shouted prince andrew and scarcely able to hold up the heavystandard he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalionwould follow himand really he only ran a few steps alone one soldier moved and thenanother and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting hurrah andovertook him a sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag thatwas swaying from its weight in prince andrews hands but he wasimmediately killed prince andrew again seized the standard anddragging it by the staff ran on with the battalion in front he saw ourartillerymen some of whom were fighting while others having abandonedtheir guns were running toward him he also saw french infantrysoldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the gunsround prince andrew and the battalion were already within twenty pacesof the cannon he heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly andto right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped buthe did not look at them he looked only at what was going on in front ofhimat the battery he now saw clearly the figure of a redhairedgunner with his shako knocked awry pulling one end of a mop while afrench soldier tugged at the other he could distinctly see thedistraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men whoevidently did not realize what they were doingwhat are they about thought prince andrew as he gazed at them whydoesnt the redhaired gunner run away as he is unarmed why doesnt thefrenchman stab him he will not get away before the frenchman remembershis bayonet and stabs himand really another french soldier trailing his musket ran up to thestruggling men and the fate of the redhaired gunner who hadtriumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited himwas about to be decided but prince andrew did not see how it ended itseemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the headwith the full swing of a bludgeon it hurt a little but the worst of itwas that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he hadbeen looking atwhats this am i falling my legs are giving way thought he andfell on his back he opened his eyes hoping to see how the struggle ofthe frenchmen with the gunners ended whether the redhaired gunner hadbeen killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or savedbut he saw nothing above him there was now nothing but the skythelofty sky not clear yet still immeasurably lofty with gray cloudsgliding slowly across it how quiet peaceful and solemn not at allas i ran thought prince andrewnot as we ran shouting and fightingnot at all as the gunner and the frenchman with frightened and angryfaces struggled for the mop how differently do those clouds glideacross that lofty infinite sky how was it i did not see that lofty skybefore and how happy i am to have found it at last yes all is vanityall falsehood except that infinite sky there is nothing nothing butthat but even it does not exist there is nothing but quiet and peacethank godon our right flank commanded by bagration at nine oclock the battlehad not yet begun not wishing to agree to dolgorukovs demand tocommence the action and wishing to avert responsibility from himselfprince bagration proposed to dolgorukov to send to inquire of thecommanderinchief bagration knew that as the distance between the twoflanks was more than six miles even if the messenger were not killedwhich he very likely would be and found the commanderinchief whichwould be very difficult he would not be able to get back beforeeveningbagration cast his large expressionless sleepy eyes round his suiteand the boyish face rostov breathless with excitement and hope was thefirst to catch his eye he sent himand if i should meet his majesty before i meet the commanderinchiefyour excellency said rostov with his hand to his capyou can give the message to his majesty said dolgorukov hurriedlyinterrupting bagrationon being relieved from picket duty rostov had managed to get a fewhours sleep before morning and felt cheerful bold and resolute withelasticity of movement faith in his good fortune and generally in thatstate of mind which makes everything seem possible pleasant and easyall his wishes were being fulfilled that morning there was to be ageneral engagement in which he was taking part more than that he wasorderly to the bravest general and still more he was going with amessage to kutuzov perhaps even to the sovereign himself the morningwas bright he had a good horse under him and his heart was full of joyand happiness on receiving the order he gave his horse the rein andgalloped along the line at first he rode along the line of bagrationstroops which had not yet advanced into action but were standingmotionless then he came to the region occupied by uvarovs cavalry andhere he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle havingpassed uvarovs cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon andmusketry ahead of him the firing grew louder and louderin the fresh morning air were now heard not two or three musket shotsat irregular intervals as before followed by one or two cannon shotsbut a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill beforepratzen interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimesseveral of them were not separated from one another but merged into ageneral roarhe could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one anotherdown the hillsides and clouds of cannon smoke rolling spreading andmingling with one another he could also by the gleam of bayonetsvisible through the smoke make out moving masses of infantry and narrowlines of artillery with green caissonsrostov stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was goingon but strain his attention as he would he could not understand or makeout anything of what was happening there in the smoke men of some sortwere moving about in front and behind moved lines of troops but whywhither and who they were it was impossible to make out these sightsand sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him on thecontrary they stimulated his energy and determinationgo on go on give it them he mentally exclaimed at these sounds andagain proceeded to gallop along the line penetrating farther andfarther into the region where the army was already in actionhow it will be there i dont know but all will be well thoughtrostovafter passing some austrian troops he noticed that the next part of theline the guards was already in actionso much the better i shall see it close he thoughthe was riding almost along the front line a handful of men camegalloping toward him they were our uhlans who with disordered rankswere returning from the attack rostov got out of their wayinvoluntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding and galloped onthat is no business of mine he thought he had not ridden manyhundred yards after that before he saw to his left across the wholewidth of the field an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant whiteuniforms mounted on black horses trotting straight toward him andacross his path rostov put his horse to full gallop to get out of theway of these men and he would have got clear had they continued at thesame speed but they kept increasing their pace so that some of thehorses were already galloping rostov heard the thud of their hoofs andthe jingle of their weapons and saw their horses their figures andeven their faces more and more distinctly they were our horse guardsadvancing to attack the french cavalry that was coming to meet themthe horse guards were galloping but still holding in their horsesrostov could already see their faces and heard the command chargeshouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to full speedrostov fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on the frenchgalloped along the front as hard as his horse could go but still wasnot in time to avoid themthe last of the horse guards a huge pockmarked fellow frowned angrilyon seeing rostov before him with whom he would inevitably collide thisguardsman would certainly have bowled rostov and his bedouin overrostov felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic menand horses had it not occurred to rostov to flourish his whip beforethe eyes of the guardsmans horse the heavy black horse sixteen handshigh shied throwing back its ears but the pockmarked guardsman drovehis huge spurs in violently and the horse flourishing its tail andextending its neck galloped on yet faster hardly had the horse guardspassed rostov before he heard them shout hurrah and looking back sawthat their foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry withred epaulets probably french he could see nothing more forimmediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and smokeenveloped everythingat that moment as the horse guards having passed him disappeared inthe smoke rostov hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go wherehe was sent this was the brilliant charge of the horse guards thatamazed the french themselves rostov was horrified to hear later that ofall that mass of huge and handsome men of all those brilliant richyouths officers and cadets who had galloped past him on theirthousandruble horses only eighteen were left after the chargewhy should i envy them my chance is not lost and maybe i shall seethe emperor immediately thought rostov and galloped onwhen he came level with the foot guards he noticed that about them andaround them cannon balls were flying of which he was aware not so muchbecause he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on thesoldiers faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of theofficerspassing behind one of the lines of a regiment of foot guards he heard avoice calling him by namerostovwhat he answered not recognizing borisi say weve been in the front line our regiment attacked said boriswith the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been underfire for the first timerostov stoppedhave you he said well how did it gowe drove them back said boris with animation growing talkative canyou imagine it and he began describing how the guards having taken uptheir position and seeing troops before them thought they wereaustrians and all at once discovered from the cannon balls dischargedby those troops that they were themselves in the front line and hadunexpectedly to go into action rostov without hearing boris to the endspurred his horsewhere are you off to asked boriswith a message to his majestythere he is said boris thinking rostov had said his highness andpointing to the grand duke who with his high shoulders and frowningbrows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet and horseguards jacket shouting something to a pale white uniformed austrianofficerbut thats the grand duke and i want the commanderinchief or theemperor said rostov and was about to spur his horsecount count shouted berg who ran up from the other side as eager asboris count i am wounded in my right hand and he showed hisbleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it and i remained at thefront i held my sword in my left hand count all our familythe vonbergshave been knightshe said something more but rostov did not wait to hear it and rodeawayhaving passed the guards and traversed an empty space rostov to avoidagain getting in front of the first line as he had done when the horseguards charged followed the line of reserves going far round the placewhere the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard suddenly heheard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troopswhere he could never have expected the enemy to bewhat can it be he thought the enemy in the rear of our armyimpossible and suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himselfand for the issue of the whole battle but be that what it may hereflected there is no riding round it now i must look for thecommander in chief here and if all is lost it is for me to perish withthe restthe foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over rostov was more andmore confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village ofpratzen which was full of troops of all kindswhat does it mean what is it whom are they firing at who is firingrostov kept asking as he came up to russian and austrian soldiersrunning in confused crowds across his paththe devil knows theyve killed everybody its all up now he wastold in russian german and czech by the crowd of fugitives whounderstood what was happening as little as he didkill the germans shouted onemay the devil take themthe traitorszum henker diese russen  muttered a german hang these russiansseveral wounded men passed along the road and words of abuse screamsand groans mingled in a general hubbub then the firing died downrostov learned later that russian and austrian soldiers had been firingat one anothermy god what does it all mean thought he and here where at anymoment the emperor may see them but no these must be only a handfulof scoundrels it will soon be over it cant be that it cant be onlyto get past them quicker quickerthe idea of defeat and flight could not enter rostovs head though hesaw french cannon and french troops on the pratzen heights just where hehad been ordered to look for the commanderinchief he could not didnot wish to believe thatrostov had been ordered to look for kutuzov and the emperor near thevillage of pratzen but neither they nor a single commanding officerwere there only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds heurged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds butthe farther he went the more disorganized they were the highroad onwhich he had come out was thronged with caleches carriages of allsorts and russian and austrian soldiers of all arms some wounded andsome not this whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under thedismal influence of cannon balls flying from the french batteriesstationed on the pratzen heightswhere is the emperor where is kutuzov rostov kept asking everyone hecould stop but got no answer from anyoneat last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answereh brother theyve all bolted long ago said the soldier laughingfor some reason and shaking himself freehaving left that soldier who was evidently drunk rostov stopped thehorse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began toquestion him the man announced that the tsar had been driven in acarriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road andthat he was dangerously woundedit cant be said rostov it must have been someone elsei saw him myself replied the man with a selfconfident smile ofderision i ought to know the emperor by now after the times ive seenhim in petersburg i saw him just as i see you there he sat in thecarriage as pale as anything how they made the four black horses flygracious me they did rattle past its time i knew the imperial horsesand ilya ivanych i dont think ilya drives anyone except the tsarrostov let go of the horse and was about to ride on when a woundedofficer passing by addressed himwho is it you want he asked the commanderinchief he was killedby a cannon ballstruck in the breast before our regimentnot killedwounded another officer corrected himwho kutuzov asked rostovnot kutuzov but whats his namewell never mind there are notmany left alive go that way to that village all the commanders arethere said the officer pointing to the village of hosjeradek and hewalked onrostov rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was nowgoing the emperor was wounded the battle lost it was impossible todoubt it now rostov rode in the direction pointed out to him in whichhe saw turrets and a church what need to hurry what was he now to sayto the tsar or to kutuzov even if they were alive and unwoundedtake this road your honor that way you will be killed at once asoldier shouted to him theyd kill you thereoh what are you talking about said another where is he to go thatway is nearerrostov considered and then went in the direction where they said hewould be killedits all the same now if the emperor is wounded am i to try to savemyself he thought he rode on to the region where the greatest numberof men had perished in fleeing from pratzen the french had not yetoccupied that region and the russiansthe uninjured and slightlywoundedhad left it long ago all about the field like heaps of manureon wellkept plowland lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to eachcouple of acres the wounded crept together in twos and threes and onecould hear their distressing screams and groans sometimes feignedorso it seemed to rostov he put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing allthese suffering men and he felt afraidafraid not for his life butfor the courage he needed and which he knew would not stand the sight ofthese unfortunatesthe french who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead andwounded where there was no one left to fire at on seeing an adjutantriding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots thesensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses aroundhim merged in rostovs mind into a single feeling of terror and pity forhimself he remembered his mothers last letter what would she feelthought he if she saw me here now on this field with the cannon aimedat mein the village of hosjeradek there were russian troops retiring from thefield of battle who though still in some confusion were lessdisordered the french cannon did not reach there and the musketry firesounded far away here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle waslost no one whom rostov asked could tell him where the emperor orkutuzov was some said the report that the emperor was wounded wascorrect others that it was not and explained the false rumor that hadspread by the fact that the emperors carriage had really galloped fromthe field of battle with the pale and terrified oberhofmarschal counttolstoy who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in theemperors suite one officer told rostov that he had seen someone fromheadquarters behind the village to the left and thither rostov rodenot hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience when he hadridden about two miles and had passed the last of the russian troops hesaw near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it two men on horsebackfacing the ditch one with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar torostov the other on a beautiful chestnut horse which rostov fancied hehad seen before rode up to the ditch struck his horse with his spursand giving it the rein leaped lightly over only a little earth crumbledfrom the bank under the horses hind hoofs turning the horse sharplyhe again jumped the ditch and deferentially addressed the horseman withthe white plumes evidently suggesting that he should do the same therider whose figure seemed familiar to rostov and involuntarily rivetedhis attention made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and bythat gesture rostov instantly recognized his lamented and adoredmonarchbut it cant be he alone in the midst of this empty field thoughtrostov at that moment alexander turned his head and rostov saw thebeloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory the emperorwas pale his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow but the charm themildness of his features was all the greater rostov was happy in theassurance that the rumors about the emperor being wounded were false hewas happy to be seeing him he knew that he might and even ought to gostraight to him and give the message dolgorukov had ordered him todeliverbut as a youth in love trembles is unnerved and dares not utter thethoughts he has dreamed of for nights but looks around for help or achance of delay and flight when the longedfor moment comes and he isalone with her so rostov now that he had attained what he had longedfor more than anything else in the world did not know how to approachthe emperor and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would beinconvenient unseemly and impossible to do sowhat it is as if i were glad of a chance to take advantage of hisbeing alone and despondent a strange face may seem unpleasant orpainful to him at this moment of sorrow besides what can i say to himnow when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight ofhim not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the emperor thathe had composed in his imagination could he now recall those speecheswere intended for quite other conditions they were for the most part tobe spoken at a moment of victory and triumph generally when he wasdying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds andwhile dying he expressed the love his actions had provedbesides how can i ask the emperor for his instructions for the rightflank now that it is nearly four oclock and the battle is lost nocertainly i must not approach him i must not intrude on hisreflections better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkindlook or bad opinion from him rostov decided and sorrowfully and witha heart full despair he rode away continually looking back at the tsarwho still remained in the same attitude of indecisionwhile rostov was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly awaycaptain von toll chanced to ride to the same spot and seeing theemperor at once rode up to him offered his services and assisted himto cross the ditch on foot the emperor wishing to rest and feelingunwell sat down under an apple tree and von toll remained beside himrostov from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von toll spoke longand warmly to the emperor and how the emperor evidently weepingcovered his eyes with his hand and pressed von tolls handand i might have been in his place thought rostov and hardlyrestraining his tears of pity for the emperor he rode on in utterdespair not knowing where to or why he was now ridinghis despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness wasthe cause of his griefhe might not only might but should have gone up to the sovereign itwas a unique chance to show his devotion to the emperor and he had notmade use of it what have i done thought he and he turned roundand galloped back to the place where he had seen the emperor but therewas no one beyond the ditch now only some carts and carriages werepassing by from one of the drivers he learned that kutuzovs staff werenot far off in the village the vehicles were going to rostov followedthem in front of him walked kutuzovs groom leading horses inhorsecloths then came a cart and behind that walked an old bandylegged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coattit i say tit said the groomwhat answered the old man absentmindedlygo tit thresh a bitoh you fool said the old man spitting angrily some time passed insilence and then the same joke was repeatedbefore five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points morethan a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the frenchprzebyszewski and his corps had laid down their arms other columnsafter losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confusedmassesthe remains of langerons and dokhturovs mingled forces were crowdingaround the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of augesdafter five oclock it was only at the augesd dam that a hot cannonadedelivered by the french alone was still to be heard from numerousbatteries ranged on the slopes of the pratzen heights directed at ourretreating forcesin the rearguard dokhturov and others rallying some battalions kept upa musketry fire at the french cavalry that was pursuing our troops itwas growing dusk on the narrow augesd dam where for so many years theold miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefullyangling while his grandson with shirt sleeves rolled up handled thefloundering silvery fish in the watering can on that dam over which forso many years moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefullydriven their twohorse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dustywith flour whitening their cartson that narrow dam amid the wagons andthe cannon under the horses hoofs and between the wagon wheels mendisfigured by fear of death now crowded together crushing one anotherdying stepping over the dying and killing one another only to move ona few steps and be killed themselves in the same wayevery ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around or ashell burst in the midst of that dense throng killing some andsplashing with blood those near themdolokhovnow an officerwounded in the arm and on foot with theregimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his companyrepresented all that was left of that whole regiment impelled by thecrowd they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and jammed inon all sides had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under acannon and the crowd were dragging it out a cannon ball killed someonebehind them another fell in front and splashed dolokhov with blood thecrowd pushing forward desperately squeezed together moved a fewsteps and again stoppedmove on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved remain here anothertwo minutes and it is certain death thought each onedolokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge ofthe dam throwing two soldiers off their feet and ran onto the slipperyice that covered the millpoolturn this way he shouted jumping over the ice which creaked underhim turn this way he shouted to those with the gun it bearsthe ice bore him but it swayed and creaked and it was plain that itwould give way not only under a cannon or a crowd but very soon evenunder his weight alone the men looked at him and pressed to the bankhesitating to step onto the ice the general on horseback at theentrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to addressdolokhov suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd thateveryone ducked it flopped into something moist and the general fellfrom his horse in a pool of blood nobody gave him a look or thought ofraising himget onto the ice over the ice go on turn dont you hear go oninnumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck thegeneral the men themselves not knowing what or why they wereshoutingone of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto theice crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pondthe ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers and one leg slippedinto the water he tried to right himself but fell in up to his waistthe nearest soldiers shrank back the gun driver stopped his horse butfrom behind still came the shouts onto the ice why do you stop goon go on and cries of horror were heard in the crowd the soldiersnear the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn andmove on the horses moved off the bank the ice that had held underthose on foot collapsed in a great mass and some forty men who were onit dashed some forward and some back drowning one anotherstill the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto theice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that coveredthe dam the pond and the bankon the pratzen heights where he had fallen with the flagstaff in hishand lay prince andrew bolkonski bleeding profusely and unconsciouslyuttering a gentle piteous and childlike moantoward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still he did not knowhow long his unconsciousness lasted suddenly he again felt that he wasalive and suffering from a burning lacerating pain in his headwhere is it that lofty sky that i did not know till now but sawtoday was his first thought and i did not know this sufferingeither he thought yes i did not know anything anything at all tillnow but where am ihe listened and heard the sound of approaching horses and voicesspeaking french he opened his eyes above him again was the same loftysky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher andbetween them gleamed blue infinity he did not turn his head and did notsee those who judging by the sound of hoofs and voices had ridden upand stopped near himit was napoleon accompanied by two aidesdecamp bonaparte riding overthe battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteriesfiring at the augesd dam and was looking at the killed and wounded lefton the fieldfine men remarked napoleon looking at a dead russian grenadier whowith his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape lay on hisstomach with an already stiffened arm flung widethe ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted your majestysaid an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were firing ataugesdhave some brought from the reserve said napoleon and having gone ona few steps he stopped before prince andrew who lay on his back withthe flagstaff that had been dropped beside him the flag had alreadybeen taken by the french as a trophythats a fine death said napoleon as he gazed at bolkonskiprince andrew understood that this was said of him and that it wasnapoleon who said it he heard the speaker addressed as sire but heheard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly not onlydid they not interest him but he took no notice of them and at onceforgot them his head was burning he felt himself bleeding to deathand he saw above him the remote lofty and everlasting sky he knew itwas napoleonhis herobut at that moment napoleon seemed to him such asmall insignificant creature compared with what was passing now betweenhimself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it atthat moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him orwhat was said of him he was only glad that people were standing nearhim and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to lifewhich seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned tounderstand it so differently he collected all his strength to stir andutter a sound he feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak sickly groanwhich aroused his own pityah he is alive said napoleon lift this young man up and carry himto the dressing stationhaving said this napoleon rode on to meet marshal lannes who hat inhand rode up smiling to the emperor to congratulate him on the victoryprince andrew remembered nothing more he lost consciousness from theterrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher the jolting whilebeing moved and the probing of his wound at the dressing station hedid not regain consciousness till late in the day when with otherwounded and captured russian officers he was carried to the hospitalduring this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to lookabout him and even speakthe first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a frenchconvoy officer who said rapidly we must halt here the emperor willpass here immediately it will please him to see these gentlemenprisonersthere are so many prisoners today nearly the whole russian army thathe is probably tired of them said another officerall the same they say this one is the commander of all the emperoralexanders guards said the first one indicating a russian officer inthe white uniform of the horse guardsbolkonski recognized prince repnin whom he had met in petersburgsociety beside him stood a lad of nineteen also a wounded officer ofthe horse guardsbonaparte having come up at a gallop stopped his horsewhich is the senior he asked on seeing the prisonersthey named the colonel prince repninyou are the commander of the emperor alexanders regiment of horseguards asked napoleoni commanded a squadron replied repninyour regiment fulfilled its duty honorably said napoleonthe praise of a great commander is a soldiers highest reward saidrepnini bestow it with pleasure said napoleon and who is that young manbeside youprince repnin named lieutenant sukhtelenafter looking at him napoleon smiledhes very young to come to meddle with usyouth is no hindrance to courage muttered sukhtelen in a failingvoicea splendid reply said napoleon young man you will go farprince andrew who had also been brought forward before the emperorseyes to complete the show of prisoners could not fail to attract hisattention napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefieldand addressing him again used the epithet young man that wasconnected in his memory with prince andrewwell and you young man said he how do you feel mon bravethough five minutes before prince andrew had been able to say a fewwords to the soldiers who were carrying him now with his eyes fixedstraight on napoleon he was silent so insignificant at that momentseemed to him all the interests that engrossed napoleon so mean did hishero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear comparedto the lofty equitable and kindly sky which he had seen andunderstood that he could not answer himeverything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with thestern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of bloodsuffering and the nearness of death aroused in him looking intonapoleons eyes prince andrew thought of the insignificance ofgreatness the unimportance of life which no one could understand andthe still greater unimportance of death the meaning of which no onealive could understand or explainthe emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one ofthe officers as he went have these gentlemen attended to and taken tomy bivouac let my doctor larrey examine their wounds au revoirprince repnin and he spurred his horse and galloped awayhis face shone with selfsatisfaction and pleasurethe soldiers who had carried prince andrew had noticed and taken thelittle gold icon princess mary had hung round her brothers neck butseeing the favor the emperor showed the prisoners they now hastened toreturn the holy imageprince andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced but thelittle icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chestoutside his uniformit would be good thought prince andrew glancing at the icon hissister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence itwould be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems tomary how good it would be to know where to seek for help in this lifeand what to expect after it beyond the grave how happy and calm ishould be if i could now say lord have mercy on me but to whomshould i say that either to a power indefinable incomprehensiblewhich i not only cannot address but which i cannot even express inwordsthe great all or nothing said he to himself or to that godwho has been sewn into this amulet by mary there is nothing certainnothing at all except the unimportance of everything i understand andthe greatness of something incomprehensible but allimportantthe stretchers moved on at every jolt he again felt unendurable painhis feverishness increased and he grew delirious visions of his fatherwife sister and future son and the tenderness he had felt the nightbefore the battle the figure of the insignificant little napoleon andabove all this the lofty sky formed the chief subjects of his deliriousfanciesthe quiet home life and peaceful happiness of bald hills presenteditself to him he was already enjoying that happiness when that littlenapoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look ofshortsighted delight at the misery of others and doubts and tormentshad followed and only the heavens promised peace toward morning allthese dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness ofunconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of napoleons doctorlarrey was much more likely to end in death than in convalescencehe is a nervous bilious subject said larrey and will not recoverand prince andrew with others fatally wounded was left to the care ofthe inhabitants of the districtearly in the year  nicholas rostov returned home on leave denisovwas going home to voronezh and rostov persuaded him to travel with himas far as moscow and to stay with him there meeting a comrade at thelast post station but one before

breakfast togetherand natasha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe like a balletdancer but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile whenrostov met sonya in the drawing room he reddened he did not know howto behave with her the evening before in the first happy moment ofmeeting they had kissed each other but today they felt it could not bedone he felt that everybody including his mother and sisters waslooking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave withher he kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as yousonyabut their eyes met and said thou and exchanged tender kisses her looksasked him to forgive her for having dared by natashas intermediacy toremind him of his promise and then thanked him for his love his looksthanked her for offering him his freedom and told her that one way oranother he would never cease to love her for that would be impossiblehow strange it is said vera selecting a moment when all were silentthat sonya and nicholas now say you to one another and meet likestrangersveras remark was correct as her remarks always were but like most ofher observations it made everyone feel uncomfortable not only sonyanicholas and natasha but even the old countess whodreading thislove affair which might hinder nicholas from making a brilliant matchblushed like a girldenisov to rostovs surprise appeared in the drawing room with pomadedhair perfumed and in a new uniform looking just as smart as he madehimself when going into battle and he was more amiable to the ladiesand gentlemen than rostov had ever expected to see himon his return to moscow from the army nicholas rostov was welcomed byhis home circle as the best of sons a hero and their darlingnikolenka by his relations as a charming attractive and polite youngman by his acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars a gooddancer and one of the best matches in the citythe rostovs knew everybody in moscow the old count had money enoughthat year as all his estates had been remortgaged and so nicholasacquiring a trotter of his own very stylish riding breeches of thelatest cut such as no one else yet had in moscow and boots of thelatest fashion with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurspassed his time very gaily after a short period of adapting himself tothe old conditions of life nicholas found it very pleasant to be athome again he felt that he had grown up and matured very much hisdespair at failing in a scripture examination his borrowing money fromgavril to pay a sleigh driver his kissing sonya on the slyhe nowrecalled all this as childishness he had left immeasurably behind nowhe was a lieutenant of hussars in a jacket laced with silver andwearing the cross of st george awarded to soldiers for bravery inaction and in the company of wellknown elderly and respected racingmen was training a trotter of his own for a race he knew a lady on oneof the boulevards whom he visited of an evening he led the mazurka atthe arkharovs ball talked about the war with field marshal kamenskivisited the english club and was on intimate terms with a colonel offorty to whom denisov had introduced himhis passion for the emperor had cooled somewhat in moscow but still ashe did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him he often spokeabout him and about his love for him letting it be understood that hehad not told all and that there was something in his feelings for theemperor not everyone could understand and with his whole soul he sharedthe adoration then common in moscow for the emperor who was spoken ofas the angel incarnateduring rostovs short stay in moscow before rejoining the army he didnot draw closer to sonya but rather drifted away from her she was verypretty and sweet and evidently deeply in love with him but he was atthe period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is no timefor that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself and prizeshis freedom which he needs for so many other things when he thought ofsonya during this stay in moscow he said to himself ah there willbe and there are many more such girls somewhere whom i do not yetknow there will be time enough to think about love when i want to butnow i have no time besides it seemed to him that the society of womenwas rather derogatory to his manhood he went to balls and into ladiessociety with an affectation of doing so against his will the races theenglish club sprees with denisov and visits to a certain housethatwas another matter and quite the thing for a dashing young hussarat the beginning of march old count ilya rostov was very busy arranginga dinner in honor of prince bagration at the english clubthe count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown givingorders to the club steward and to the famous feoktist the clubs headcook about asparagus fresh cucumbers strawberries veal and fish forthis dinner the count had been a member and on the committee of theclub from the day it was founded to him the club entrusted thearrangement of the festival in honor of bagration for few men knew sowell how to arrange a feast on an openhanded hospitable scale andstill fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out oftheir own resources what might be needed for the success of the fetethe club cook and the steward listened to the counts orders withpleased faces for they knew that under no other management could theyso easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner costingseveral thousand rubleswell then mind and have cocks comb in the turtle soup you knowshall we have

with the businesslikepreoccupied yet meekly christian look which never left her face annamikhaylovna entered the hall though she came upon the count in hisdressing gown every day he invariably became confused and begged her toexcuse his costumeno matter at all my dear count she said meekly closing her eyesbut ill go to bezukhovs myself pierre has arrived and now we shallget anything we want from

soul as youngbezukhov yes i pity him from my heart and shall try to give him whatconsolation i canwhwhat is the matter asked both the young and old rostovanna mikhaylovna sighed deeplydolokhov mary ivanovnas son she said in a mysterious whisper hascompromised her completely they say pierre took him up invited him tohis house in petersburg and now she has come here and that daredevilafter her said anna mikhaylovna wishing to show her sympathy forpierre but by involuntary intonations and a half smile betraying hersympathy for the daredevil as she called dolokhov they say pierreis quite broken by his misfortunedear dear but still tell him to come to the clubit will all blowover it will be a tremendous banquetnext day the third of march soon after one oclock two hundred andfifty members of the english club and fifty guests were awaiting theguest of honor and hero of the austrian campaign prince bagration todinneron the first arrival of the news of the battle of austerlitz moscow hadbeen bewildered at that time the russians were so used to victoriesthat on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe itwhile others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange anevent in the english club where all who were distinguished importantand well informed foregathered when the news began to arrive indecember nothing was said about the war and the last battle as thoughall were in a conspiracy of silence the men who set the tone inconversationcount rostopchin prince yuri dolgorukov valuev countmarkov and prince vyazemskidid not show themselves at the club butmet in private houses in intimate circles and the moscovites who tooktheir opinions from othersilya rostov among themremained for a whilewithout any definite opinion on the subject of the war and withoutleaders the moscovites felt that something was wrong and that todiscuss the bad news was difficult and so it was best to be silent butafter a while just as a jury comes out of its room the bigwigs whoguided the clubs opinion reappeared and everybody began speakingclearly and definitely reasons were found for the incredible unheardof and impossible event of a russian defeat everything became clearand in all corners of moscow the same things began to be said thesereasons were the treachery of the austrians a defective commissariatthe treachery of the pole przebyszewski and of the frenchman langeronkutuzovs incapacity and it was whispered the youth and inexperienceof the sovereign who had trusted worthless and insignificant peoplebut the army the russian army everyone declared was extraordinary andhad achieved miracles of valor the soldiers officers and generalswere heroes but the hero of heroes was prince bagration distinguishedby his schon grabern affair and by the retreat from austerlitz where healone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had all day beaten back anenemy force twice as numerous as his own what also conduced tobagrations being selected as moscows hero was the fact that he had noconnections in the city and was a stranger there in his person honorwas shown to a simple fighting russian soldier without connections andintrigues and to one who was associated by memories of the italiancampaign with the name of suvorov moreover paying such honor tobagration was the best way of expressing disapproval and dislike ofkutuzovhad there been no bagration it would have been necessary to inventhim said the wit shinshin parodying the words of voltaire kutuzov noone spoke of except some who abused him in whispers calling him acourt weathercock and an old satyrall moscow repeated prince dolgorukovs saying if you go on modelingand modeling you must get smeared with clay suggesting consolation forour defeat by the memory of former victories and the words ofrostopchin that french soldiers have to be incited to battle byhighfalutin words and germans by logical arguments to show them that itis more dangerous to run away than to advance but that russian soldiersonly need to be restrained and held back on all sides new and freshanecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown by ourofficers and men at austerlitz one had saved a standard another hadkilled five frenchmen a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded bergwas mentioned by those who did not know him as having when wounded inthe right hand taken his sword in the left and gone forward ofbolkonski nothing was said and only those who knew him intimatelyregretted that he had died so young leaving a pregnant wife with hiseccentric fatheron that third of march all the rooms in the english club were filledwith a hum of conversation like the hum of bees swarming in springtimethe members and guests of the club wandered hither and thither satstood met and separated some in uniform and some in evening dressand a few here and there with powdered hair and in russian kaftanspowdered footmen in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockingsstood at every door anxiously noting visitors every movement in orderto offer their services most of those present were elderly respectedmen with broad selfconfident faces fat fingers and resolute gesturesand voices this class of guests and members sat in certain habitualplaces and met in certain habitual groups a minority of those presentwere casual guestschiefly young men among whom were denisov rostovand dolokhovwho was now again an officer in the semenov regiment thefaces of these young people especially those who were military menbore that expression of condescending respect for their elders whichseems to say to the older generation we are prepared to respect andhonor you but all the same remember that the future belongs to usnesvitski was there as an old member of the club pierre who at hiswifes command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles wentabout the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull here aselsewhere he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to hiswealth and being in the habit of lording it over these people hetreated them with absentminded contemptby his age he should have belonged to the younger men but by his wealthand connections he belonged to the groups of old and honored guests andso he went from one group to another some of the most important old menwere the center of groups which even strangers approached respectfullyto hear the voices of wellknown men the largest circles formed roundcount rostopchin valuev and naryshkin rostopchin was describing howthe russians had been overwhelmed by flying austrians and had had toforce their way through them with bayonetsvaluev was confidentially telling that uvarov had been sent frompetersburg to ascertain what moscow was thinking about austerlitzin the third circle naryshkin was speaking of the meeting of theaustrian council of war at which suvorov crowed like a cock in reply tothe nonsense talked by the austrian generals shinshin standing closeby tried to make a joke saying that kutuzov had evidently failed tolearn from suvorov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like acock but the elder members glanced severely at the wit making him feelthat in that place and on that day it was improper to speak so ofkutuzovcount ilya rostov hurried and preoccupied went about in his soft bootsbetween the dining and drawing rooms hastily greeting the important andunimportant all of whom he knew as if they were all equals while hiseyes occasionally sought out his fine wellsetup young son resting onhim and winking joyfully at him young rostov stood at a window withdolokhov whose acquaintance he had lately made and highly valued theold count came up to them and pressed dolokhovs handplease come and visit us you know my brave boy been together outthere both playing the hero ah vasili ignatovich how dye doold fellow he said turning to an old man who was passing but beforehe had finished his greeting there was a general stir and a footman whohad run in announced with a frightened face hes arrivedbells rang the stewards rushed forward andlike rye shaken togetherin a shovelthe guests who had been scattered about in different roomscame together and crowded in the large drawing room by the door of theballroombagration appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or swordwhich in accord with the club custom he had given up to the hallporter he had no lambskin cap on his head nor had he a loaded whipover his shoulder as when rostov had seen him on the eve of the battleof austerlitz but wore a tight new uniform with russian and foreignorders and the star of st george on his left breast evidently justbefore coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmedwhich changed his appearance for the worse there was something naivelyfestive in his air which in conjunction with his firm and virilefeatures gave him a rather comical expression bekleshev and theodoreuvarov who had arrived with him paused at the doorway to allow him asthe guest of honor to enter first bagration was embarrassed notwishing to avail himself of their courtesy and this caused some delayat the doors but after all he did at last enter first he walked shylyand awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room not knowingwhat to do with his hands he was more accustomed to walk over a plowedfield under fire as he had done at the head of the kursk regiment atschon grabernand he would have found that easier the committeemen methim at the first door and expressing their delight at seeing such ahighly honored guest took possession of him as it were without waitingfor his reply surrounded him and led him to the drawing room it wasat first impossible to enter the drawingroom door for the crowd ofmembers and guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look atbagration over each others shoulders as if he were some rare animalcount ilya rostov laughing and repeating the words make way dearboy make way make way pushed through the crowd more energeticallythan anyone led the guests into the drawing room and seated them onthe center sofa the bigwigs the most respected members of the clubbeset the new arrivals count ilya again thrusting his way through thecrowd went out of the drawing room and reappeared a minute later withanother committeeman carrying a large silver salver which he presentedto prince bagration on the salver lay some verses composed and printedin the heros honor bagration on seeing the salver glanced around indismay as though seeking help but all eyes demanded that he shouldsubmit feeling himself in their power he resolutely took the salverwith both hands and looked sternly and reproachfully at the count whohad presented it to him someone obligingly took the dish from bagrationor he would it seemed have held it till evening and have gone in todinner with it and drew his attention to the verseswell i will read them then bagration seemed to say and fixing hisweary eyes on the paper began to read them with a fixed and seriousexpression but the author himself took the verses and began readingthem aloud bagration bowed his head and listenedbring glory then to alexanders reign and on the throne our titusshield a dreaded foe be thou kindhearted as a man a rhipheus at homea caesar in the field een fortunate napoleon knows by experience nowbagration and dare not herculean russians troublebut before he had finished reading a stentorian majordomo announcedthat dinner was ready the door opened and from the dining room camethe resounding strains of the polonaiseconquests joyful thunder waken triumph valiant russians nowand count rostov glancing angrily at the author who went on reading hisverses bowed to bagration everyone rose feeling that dinner was moreimportant than verses and bagration again preceding all the rest wentin to dinner he was seated in the place of honor between twoalexandersbekleshev and naryshkinwhich was a significant allusion tothe name of the sovereign three hundred persons took their seats in thedining room according to their rank and importance the more importantnearer to the honored guest as naturally as water flows deepest wherethe land lies lowestjust before dinner count ilya rostov presented his son to bagrationwho recognized him and said a few words to him disjointed and awkwardas were all the words he spoke that day and count ilya looked joyfullyand proudly around while bagration spoke to his sonnicholas rostov with denisov and his new acquaintance dolokhov satalmost at the middle of the table facing them sat pierre beside princenesvitski count ilya rostov with the other members of the committee satfacing bagration and as the very personification of moscow hospitalitydid the honors to the princehis efforts had not been in vain the dinner both the lenten and theother fare was splendid yet he could not feel quite at ease till theend of the meal he winked at the butler whispered directions to thefootmen and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety everythingwas excellent with the second course a gigantic sterlet at sight ofwhich ilya rostov blushed with selfconscious pleasure the footmenbegan popping corks and filling the champagne glasses after the fishwhich made a certain sensation the count exchanged glances with theother committeemen there will be many toasts its time to begin hewhispered and taking up his glass he rose all were silent waitingfor what he would sayto the health of our sovereign the emperor he cried and at the samemoment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm theband immediately struck up conquests joyful thunder waken all roseand cried hurrah bagration also rose and shouted hurrah in exactlythe same voice in which he had shouted it on the field at schon grabernyoung rostovs ecstatic voice could be heard above the three hundredothers he nearly wept to the health of our sovereign the emperorhe roared hurrah and emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it tothe floor many followed his example and the loud shouting continuedfor a long time when the voices subsided the footmen cleared away thebroken glass and everybody sat down again smiling at the noise they hadmade and exchanging remarks the old count rose once more glanced at anote lying beside his plate and proposed a toast to the health of thehero of our last campaign prince peter ivanovich bagration and againhis blue eyes grew moist hurrah cried the three hundred voicesagain but instead of the band a choir began singing a cantata composedby paul ivanovich kutuzovrussians oer all barriers on courage conquest guarantees have we notbagration he brings foe men to their knees etcas soon as the singing was over another and another toast was proposedand count ilya rostov became more and more moved more glass wassmashed and the shouting grew louder they drank to bekleshevnaryshkin uvarov dolgorukov apraksin valuev to the committee toall the club members and to all the club guests and finally to countilya rostov separately as the organizer of the banquet at that toastthe count took out his handkerchief and covering his face weptoutrightpierre sat opposite dolokhov and nicholas rostov as usual he ate anddrank much and eagerly but those who knew him intimately noticed thatsome great change had come over him that day he was silent all throughdinner and looked about blinking and scowling or with fixed eyes anda look of complete absentmindedness kept rubbing the bridge of hisnose his face was depressed and gloomy he seemed to see and hearnothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by somedepressing and unsolved problemthe unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by theprincess his cousin at moscow concerning dolokhovs intimacy with hiswife and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning which inthe mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw badlythrough his spectacles but that his wifes connection with dolokhov wasa secret to no one but himself pierre absolutely disbelieved both theprincess hints and the letter but he feared now to look at dolokhovwho was sitting opposite him every time he chanced to meet dolokhovshandsome insolent eyes pierre felt something terrible and monstrousrising in his soul and turned quickly away involuntarily recalling hiswifes past and her relations with dolokhov pierre saw clearly thatwhat was said in the letter might be true or might at least seem to betrue had it not referred to his wife he involuntarily remembered howdolokhov who had fully recovered his former position after thecampaign had returned to petersburg and come to him availing himselfof his friendly relations with pierre as a boon companion dolokhov hadcome straight to his house and pierre had put him up and lent himmoney pierre recalled how helene had smilingly expressed disapproval ofdolokhovs living at their house and how cynically dolokhov had praisedhis wifes beauty to him and from that time till they came to moscow hadnot left them for a dayyes he is very handsome thought pierre and i know him it would beparticularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule me justbecause i have exerted myself on his behalf befriended him and helpedhim i know and understand what a spice that would add to the pleasureof deceiving me if it really were true yes if it were true but i donot believe it i have no right to and cant believe it heremembered the expression dolokhovs face assumed in his moments ofcruelty as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them intothe water or when he challenged a man to a duel without any reason orshot a postboys horse with a pistol that expression was often ondolokhovs face when looking at him yes he is a bully thoughtpierre to kill a man means nothing to him it must seem to him thateveryone is afraid of him and that must please him he must think thati too am afraid of himand in fact i am afraid of him he thoughtand again he felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his souldolokhov denisov and rostov were now sitting opposite pierre andseemed very gay rostov was talking merrily to his two friends one ofwhom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious duelist and rakeand every now and then he glanced ironically at pierre whosepreoccupied absentminded and massive figure was a very noticeable oneat the dinner rostov looked inimically at pierre first because pierreappeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian the husband of a beautyand in a wordan old woman and secondly because pierre in hispreoccupation and absentmindedness had not recognized rostov and hadnot responded to his greeting when the emperors health was drunkpierre lost in thought did not rise or lift his glasswhat are you about shouted rostov looking at him in an ecstasy ofexasperation dont you hear its his majesty the emperors healthpierre sighed rose submissively emptied his glass and waiting tillall were seated again turned with his kindly smile to rostovwhy i didnt recognize you he said but rostov was otherwiseengaged he was shouting hurrahwhy dont you renew the acquaintance said dolokhov to rostovconfound him hes a fool said rostovone should make up to the husbands of pretty women said denisovpierre did not catch what they were saying but knew they were talkingabout him he reddened and turned awaywell now to the health of handsome women said dolokhov and with aserious expression but with a smile lurking at the corners of hismouth he turned with his glass to pierreheres to the health of lovely women peterkinand their lovers headdedpierre with downcast eyes drank out of his glass without looking atdolokhov or answering him the footman who was distributing leafletswith kutuzovs cantata laid one before pierre as one of the principalguests he was just going to take it when dolokhov leaning acrosssnatched it from his hand and began reading it pierre looked atdolokhov and his eyes dropped the something terrible and monstrous thathad tormented him all dinnertime rose and took possession of him heleaned his whole massive body across the tablehow dare you take it he shoutedhearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed nesvitski and theneighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to bezukhovdont dont what are you about whispered their frightened voicesdolokhov looked at pierre with clear mirthful cruel eyes and thatsmile of his which seemed to say ah this is what i likeyou shant have it he said distinctlypale with quivering lips pierre snatched the copyyou you scoundrel i challenge you he ejaculated and pushingback his chair he rose from the tableat the very instant he did this and uttered those words pierre feltthat the question of his wifes guilt which had been tormenting him thewhole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative hehated her and was forever sundered from her despite denisovs requestthat he would take no part in the matter rostov agreed to be dolokhovssecond and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for the duel withnesvitski bezukhovs second pierre went home but rostov with dolokhovand denisov stayed on at the club till late listening to the gypsiesand other singerswell then till tomorrow at sokolniki said dolokhov as he took leaveof rostov in the club porchand do you feel quite calm rostov askeddolokhov pausedwell you see ill tell you the whole secret of dueling in two wordsif you are going to fight a duel and you make a will and writeaffectionate letters to your parents and if you think you may bekilled you are a fool and are lost for certain but go with the firmintention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible andthen all will be right as our bear huntsman at kostroma used to tellme everyone fears a bear he says but when you see one your fearsall gone and your only thought is not to let him get away and thatshow it is with me a demain mon cher  till tomorrow my dear fellownext day at eight in the morning pierre and nesvitski drove to thesokolniki forest and found dolokhov denisov and rostov already therepierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which had noconnection with the matter in hand his haggard face was yellow he hadevidently not slept that night he looked about distractedly and screwedup his eyes as if dazzled by the sun he was entirely absorbed by twoconsiderations his wifes guilt of which after his sleepless night hehad not the slightest doubt and the guiltlessness of dolokhov who hadno reason to preserve the honor of a man who was nothing to him ishould perhaps have done the same thing in his place thought pierreits even certain that i should have done the same then why this duelthis murder either i shall kill him or he will hit me in the head orelbow or knee cant i go away from here run away bury myselfsomewhere passed through his mind but just at moments when suchthoughts occurred to him he would ask in a particularly calm andabsentminded way which inspired the respect of the onlookers will itbe long are things readywhen all was ready the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriersand the pistols loaded nesvitski went up to pierrei should not be doing my duty count he said in timid tones andshould not justify your confidence and the honor you have done me inchoosing me for your second if at this grave this very grave moment idid not tell you the whole truth i think there is no sufficient groundfor this affair or for blood to be shed over it you were not rightnot quite in the right you were impetuousoh yes it is horribly stupid said pierrethen allow me to express your regrets and i am sure your opponent willaccept them said nesvitski who like the others concerned in theaffair and like everyone in similar cases did not yet believe that theaffair had come to an actual duel you know count it is much morehonorable to admit ones mistake than to let matters become irreparablethere was no insult on either side allow me to conveyno what is there to talk about said pierre its all the sameis everything ready he added only tell me where to go and where toshoot he said with an unnaturally gentle smilehe took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of thetrigger as he had not before held a pistol in his handa fact that hedid not wish to confessoh yes like that i know i only forgot said heno apologies none whatever said dolokhov to denisov who on his sidehad been attempting a reconciliation and he also went up to theappointed placethe spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road wherethe sleighs had been left in a small clearing in the pine forestcovered with melting snow the frost having begun to break up during thelast few days the antagonists stood forty paces apart at the fartheredge of the clearing the seconds measuring the paces left tracks inthe deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing andnesvitskis and dolokhovs sabers which were stuck into the ground tenpaces apart to mark the barrier it was thawing and misty at fortypaces distance nothing could be seen for three minutes all had beenready but they still delayed and all were silentwell begin said dolokhovall right said pierre still smiling in the same way a feeling ofdread was in the air it was evident that the affair so lightly beguncould no longer be averted but was taking its course independently ofmens willdenisov first went to the barrier and announced as the advesawieshave wefused a weconciliation please pwoceed take your pistols and atthe word thwee begin to advanceone two thwee he shouted angrily and stepped asidethe combatants advanced along the trodden tracks nearer and nearer toone another beginning to see one another through the mist they had theright to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier dolokhovwalked slowly without raising his pistol looking intently with hisbright sparkling blue eyes into his antagonists face his mouth woreits usual semblance of a smileso i can fire when i like said pierre and at the word three hewent quickly forward missing the trodden path and stepping into thedeep snow he held the pistol in his right hand at arms lengthapparently afraid of shooting himself with it his left hand he heldcarefully back because he wished to support his right hand with it andknew he must not do so having advanced six paces and strayed off thetrack into the snow pierre looked down at his feet then quicklyglanced at dolokhov and bending his finger as he had been shown firednot at all expecting so loud a report pierre shuddered at the sound andthen smiling at his own sensations stood still the smoke rendereddenser by the mist prevented him from seeing anything for an instantbut there was no second report as he had expected he only hearddolokhovs hurried steps and his figure came in view through the smokehe was pressing one hand to his left side while the other clutched hisdrooping pistol his face was pale rostov ran toward him and saidsomethingnooo muttered dolokhov through his teeth no its not over andafter stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the saber he sank onthe snow beside it his left hand was bloody he wiped it on his coatand supported himself with it his frowning face was pallid andquiveredplea began dolokhov but could not at first pronounce the wordplease he uttered with an effortpierre hardly restraining his sobs began running toward dolokhov andwas about to cross the space between the barriers when dolokhov criedto your barrier and pierre grasping what was meant stopped by hissaber only ten paces divided them dolokhov lowered his head to thesnow greedily bit at it again raised his head adjusted himself drewin his legs and sat up seeking a firm center of gravity he sucked andswallowed the cold snow his lips quivered but his eyes still smilingglittered with effort and exasperation as he mustered his remainingstrength he raised his pistol and aimedsideways cover yourself with your pistol ejaculated nesvitskicover yourself even denisov cried to his adversarypierre with a gentle smile of pity and remorse his arms and legshelplessly spread out stood with his broad chest directly facingdolokhov looked sorrowfully at him denisov rostov and nesvitskiclosed their eyes at the same instant they heard a report anddolokhovs angry crymissed shouted dolokhov and he lay helplessly face downwards on thesnowpierre clutched his temples and turning round went into the foresttrampling through the deep snow and muttering incoherent wordsfolly folly death lies he repeated puckering his facenesvitski stopped him and took him homerostov and denisov drove away with the wounded dolokhovthe latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answera word to the questions addressed to him but on entering moscow hesuddenly came to and lifting his head with an effort took rostov whowas sitting beside him by the hand rostov was struck by the totallyaltered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on dolokhovsfacewell how do you feel he askedbad but its not that my friend said dolokhov with a gasping voicewhere are we in moscow i know i dont matter but i have killed herkilled she wont get over it she wont survivewho asked rostovmy mother my mother my angel my adored angel mother and dolokhovpressed rostovs hand and burst into tearswhen he had become a little quieter he explained to rostov that he wasliving with his mother who if she saw him dying would not survive ithe implored rostov to go on and prepare herrostov went on ahead to do what was asked and to his great surpriselearned that dolokhov the brawler dolokhov the bully lived in moscowwith an old mother and a hunchback sister and was the most affectionateof sons and brotherspierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone both in petersburg and inmoscow their house was always full of visitors the night after the duelhe did not go to his bedroom but as he often did remained in hisfathers room that huge room in which count bezukhov had diedhe lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that hadhappened to him but could not do so such a storm of feelingsthoughts and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fallasleep nor even remain in one place but had to jump up and pace theroom with rapid steps now he seemed to see her in the early days oftheir marriage with bare shoulders and a languid passionate look onher face and then immediately he saw beside her dolokhovs handsomeinsolent hard and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet andthen that same face pale quivering and suffering as it had been whenhe reeled and sank on the snowwhat has happened he asked himself i have killed her lover yeskilled my wifes lover yes that was it and why how did i come to doitbecause you married her answered an inner voicebut in what was i to blame he asked in marrying her without lovingher in deceiving yourself and her and he vividly recalled that momentafter supper at prince vasilis when he spoke those words he had foundso difficult to utter i love you it all comes from that even theni felt it he thought i felt then that it was not so that i had noright to do it and so it turns outhe remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollectionparticularly vivid humiliating and shameful was the recollection ofhow one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into hisstudy a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his headsteward there who bowing respectfully looked into his face and at hisdressing gown and smiled slightly as if expressing respectfulunderstanding of his employers happinessbut how often i have felt proud of her proud of her majestic beautyand social tact thought he been proud of my house in which shereceived all petersburg proud of her unapproachability and beauty sothis is what i was proud of i then thought that i did not understandher how often when considering her character i have told myself that iwas to blame for not understanding her for not understanding thatconstant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desiresand the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depravedwoman now i have spoken that terrible word to myself all has becomeclearanatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss hernaked shoulders she did not give him the money but let herself bekissed her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy and she repliedwith a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous let himdo what he pleases she used to say of me one day i asked her if shefelt any symptoms of pregnancy she laughed contemptuously and said shewas not a fool to want to have children and that she was not going tohave any children by methen he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and thevulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her though she hadbeen brought up in the most aristocratic circlesim not such a fool just you try it on allezvous promener she used to say often seeing the success she had with young and old menand women pierre could not understand why he did not love her you clear out of thisyes i never loved her said he to himself i knew she was a depravedwoman he repeated but dared not admit it to myself and now theresdolokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and perhaps dyingwhile meeting my remorse with some forced bravadopierre was one of those people who in spite of an appearance of what iscalled weak character do not seek a confidant in their troubles hedigested his sufferings aloneit is all all her fault he said to himself but what of that whydid i bind myself to her why did i say je vous aime  to her whichwas a lie and worse than a lie i am guilty and must endure what aslur on my name a misfortune for life oh thats nonsense hethought the slur on my name and honorthats all apart from myself i love youlouis xvi was executed because they said he was dishonorable and acriminal came into pierres head and from their point of view theywere right as were those too who canonized him and died a martyrsdeath for his sake then robespierre was beheaded for being a despotwho is right and who is wrong no one but if you are alivelivetomorrow youll die as i might have died an hour ago and is it worthtormenting oneself when one has only a moment of life in comparisonwith eternitybut at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflectionsshe suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he hadmost strongly expressed his insincere love for her and he felt theblood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move about and breakand tear whatever came to his hand why did i tell her that je vousaime he kept repeating to himself and when he had said it for thetenth time molieres words mais que diable allaitil faire dans cettegalere occurred to him and he began to laugh at himself but what the devil was he doing in that galleyin the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go topetersburg he could not imagine how he could speak to her now heresolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of hisintention to part from her

expressionunable to realize where he wasthe countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at homesaid the valetbut before pierre could decide what answer he would send the countessherself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and withsimply dressed hair two immense plaits twice round her lovely head likea coronet entered the room calm and majestic except that there was awrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow with herimperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in front of the valet sheknew of the duel and had come to speak about it she waited till thevalet had set down the coffee things and left the room pierre looked ather timidly over his spectacles and like a hare surrounded by houndswho lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before herenemies he tried to continue reading but feeling this to be senselessand impossible he again glanced timidly at her she did not sit downbut looked at him with a contemptuous smile waiting for the valet togowell whats this now what have you been up to now i should like toknow she asked sternlyi what have i stammered pierreso it seems youre a hero eh come now what was this duel about

sufferingphysically at that moment there was a weight on his chest and he couldnot breathe he knew that he must do something to put an end to thissuffering but what he wanted to do was too terriblewe had better separate he muttered in a broken voiceseparate very well but only if you give me a fortune said heleneseparate thats a thing to frighten me withpierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward herill kill you he shouted and seizing the marble top of a table witha strength he had never before felt he made a step toward herbrandishing the slabhelenes face became terrible she shrieked and sprang aside hisfathers nature showed itself in pierre he felt the fascination anddelight of frenzy he flung down the slab broke it and swooping downon her with outstretched hands shouted

to control all his estatesin great russia which formed the larger part of his property and leftfor petersburg alonetwo months had elapsed since the news of the battle of austerlitz andthe loss of prince andrew had reached bald hills and in spite of theletters sent through the embassy and all the searches made his body hadnot been found nor was he on the list of prisoners what was worst ofall for his relations was the fact that there was still a possibility ofhis having been picked up on the battlefield by the people of the placeand that he might now be lying recovering or dying alone amongstrangers and unable to send news of himself the gazettes from whichthe old prince first heard of the defeat at austerlitz stated as usualvery briefly and vaguely that after brilliant engagements the russianshad had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order theold prince understood from this official report that our army had beendefeated a week after the gazette report of the battle of austerlitzcame a letter from kutuzov informing the prince of the fate that hadbefallen his sonyour son wrote kutuzov fell before my eyes a standard in his handand at the head of a regimenthe fell as a hero worthy of his fatherand his fatherland to the great regret of myself and of the whole armyit is still uncertain whether he is alive or not i comfort myself andyou with the hope that your son is alive for otherwise he would havebeen mentioned among the officers found on the field of battle a listof whom has been sent me under flag of truceafter receiving this news late in the evening when he was alone in hisstudy the old prince went for his walk as usual next morning but hewas silent with his steward the gardener and the architect and thoughhe looked very grim he said nothing to anyonewhen princess mary went to him at the usual hour he was working at hislathe and as usual did not look round at herah princess mary he said suddenly in an unnatural voice throwingdown his chisel the wheel continued to revolve by its own impetus andprincess mary long remembered the dying creak of that wheel whichmerged in her memory with what followedshe approached him saw his face and something gave way within her hereyes grew dim by the expression of her fathers face not sad notcrushed but angry and working unnaturally she saw that hanging overher and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune the worst inlife one she had not yet experienced irreparable and incomprehensiblethe death of one she lovedfather andrewsaid the ungraceful awkward princess with such anindescribable charm of sorrow and selfforgetfulness that her fathercould not bear her look but turned away with a sobbad news hes not among the prisoners nor among the killed kutuzovwrites and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to drive theprincess away by that scream killedthe princess did not fall down or faint she was already pale but onhearing these words her face changed and something brightened in herbeautiful radiant eyes it was as if joya supreme joy apart from thejoys and sorrows of this worldoverflowed the great grief within hershe forgot all fear of her father went up to him took his hand anddrawing him down put her arm round his thin scraggy neckfather she said do not turn away from me let us weep togetherscoundrels blackguards shrieked the old man turning his face awayfrom her destroying the army destroying the men and why go go andtell lisethe princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father andwept she saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he tookleave of her and of lise his look tender yet proud she saw him tenderand amused as he was when he put on the little icon did he believehad he repented of his unbelief was he now

ofattention to something within her that is only seen in pregnant womenand suddenly began to cryhas anything come from andrew she askedno you know its too soon for news but my father is anxious and

bedroom on theirfaces was a quiet and solemn lookprincess mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in thehouse now and then opening her door when someone passed and watchingwhat was going on in the passage some women passing with quiet steps inand out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and turned away she didnot venture to ask any questions and shut the door again now sittingdown in her easy chair now taking her prayer book now kneeling beforethe icon stand to her surprise and distress she found that her prayersdid not calm her excitement suddenly her door opened softly and her oldnurse praskovya savishna who hardly ever came to that room as the oldprince had forbidden it appeared on the threshold with a shawl roundher headive come to sit with you a bit masha said the nurse and here ivebrought the princes wedding candles to light before his saint myangel she said with a sighoh nurse im so gladgod is merciful birdiethe nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons and sat down by the doorwith her knitting princess mary took a book and began reading onlywhen footsteps or voices were heard did they look at one another theprincess anxious and inquiring the nurse encouraging everyone in thehouse was dominated by the same feeling that princess mary experiencedas she sat in her room but owing to the superstition that the fewer thepeople who know of it the less a woman in travail suffers everyonetried to pretend not to know no one spoke of it but apart from theordinary staid and respectful good manners habitual in the princeshousehold a common anxiety a softening of the heart and aconsciousness that something great and mysterious was being accomplishedat that moment made itself feltthere was no laughter in the maids large hall in the men servantshall all sat waiting silently and alert in the outlying serfsquarters torches and candles were burning and no one slept the oldprince stepping on his heels paced up and down his study and senttikhon to ask

went and told the princevery good said the prince closing the door behind him and tikhon didnot hear the slightest sound from the study after thatafter a while he reentered it as if to snuff the candles and seeingthe prince was lying on the sofa looked at him noticed his perturbedface shook his head and going up to him silently kissed him on theshoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why hehad entered the most solemn mystery in the world continued its courseevening passed night came and the feeling of suspense and softening ofheart in the presence of the unfathomable did not lessen but increasedno one sleptit was one of those march nights when winter seems to wish to resume itssway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury a relayof horses had been sent up the highroad to meet the german doctor frommoscow who was expected every moment and men on horseback with lanternswere sent to the crossroads to guide him over the country road with itshollows and snowcovered pools of waterprincess mary had long since put aside her book she sat silent herluminous eyes fixed on her nurses wrinkled face every line of whichshe knew so well on the lock of gray hair that escaped from under thekerchief and the loose skin that hung under her chinnurse savishna knitting in hand was telling in low tones scarcelyhearing or understanding her own words what she had told hundreds oftimes before how the late princess had given birth to princess mary inkishenev with only a moldavian peasant woman to help instead of amidwifegod is merciful doctors

each room as soon as the larksreturned and forcing open a loosely closed latch set the damaskcurtain flapping and blew out the candle with its chill snowy draftprincess mary shuddered her nurse putting down the stocking she wasknitting went to the window and leaning out tried to catch the opencasement the cold wind flapped the ends of her kerchief and her looselocks of gray hairprincess my

the voice of demyan the house steward who wasdownstairsthen the voice said something more demyan replied and the steps in thefelt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more rapidlyits andrew thought princess mary no it cant be that would be tooextraordinary and at the very moment she thought this the face andfigure of prince andrew in a fur cloak the deep collar of which coveredwith snow appeared on the landing where the footman stood with thecandle yes it was he pale thin with a changed and strangelysoftened but agitated expression on his face he came up the stairs andembraced his sisteryou did not get my letter he asked and not waiting for a replywhich he would not have received for the princess was unable to speakhe turned back rapidly mounted the stairs again

sons neck and without a word he began to sob like a childthree days later the little princess was buried and prince andrew wentup the steps to where the coffin stood to give her the farewell kissand there in the coffin was the same face though with closed eyes ahwhat have you done to me it still seemed to say and prince andrewfelt that something gave way in his soul and that he was guilty of a sinhe could neither remedy nor forget he could not weep the old man toocame up and kissed the waxen little hands that lay quietly crossed oneon the other on her breast and to him too her face seemed to sayah what have you done to me and why and at the sight the old manturned angrily awayanother five days passed and then the young prince nicholas andreevichwas baptized the wet nurse supported the

life forher but those and he made a gesture of contempt and believe meif i still value my life it is only because i still hope to meet such adivine creature who will regenerate purify and elevate me but youdont understand itoh yes i quite understand answered rostov who was under his newfriends influencein the autumn the rostovs returned to moscow early in the winterdenisov also came back and stayed with them the first half of thewinter of  which nicholas rostov spent in moscow was one of thehappiest merriest times for him and the whole family nicholas broughtmany young men to his parents house vera was a handsome girl oftwenty sonya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an opening flowernatasha half grown up and half child was now childishly amusing nowgirlishly enchantingat that time in the rostovs house there prevailed an amorous atmospherecharacteristic of homes where there are very young and very charminggirls every young man who came to the houseseeing thoseimpressionable smiling young faces smiling probably at their ownhappiness feeling the eager bustle around him and hearing the fitfulbursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle ofyoung girls ready for anything and full of hopeexperienced the samefeeling sharing with the young folk of the rostovs household areadiness to fall in love and an expectation of happinessamong the young men introduced by rostov one of the first was dolokhovwhom everyone in the house liked except natasha she almost quarreledwith her brother about him she insisted that he was a bad man and thatin the duel with bezukhov pierre was right and dolokhov wrong andfurther that he was disagreeable and unnaturaltheres nothing for me to understand she cried out with resoluteselfwill he is wicked and heartless there now i like your denisovthough he is a rake and all that still i like him so you see i dounderstand i dont know how to put it with this one everything iscalculated and i dont like that but denisovoh denisov is quite different replied nicholas implying that evendenisov was nothing compared to dolokhovyou must understand what asoul there is in dolokhov you should see him with his mother what aheartwell i dont know about that but i am uncomfortable with him and doyou know he has fallen in love with sonyawhat nonsenseim certain of it youll seenatashas prediction proved true dolokhov who did not usually care forthe society of ladies began to come often to the house and thequestion for whose sake he came though no one spoke of it was soonsettled he came because of sonya and sonya though she would neverhave dared to say so knew it and blushed scarlet every time dolokhovappeareddolokhov often dined at the rostovs never missed a performance atwhich they were present and went to iogels balls for young peoplewhich the rostovs always attended he was pointedly attentive to sonyaand looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear hisglances without coloring but even the old countess and natasha blushedwhen they saw his looksit was evident that this strange strong man was under the irresistibleinfluence of the dark graceful girl who loved anotherrostov noticed something new in dolokhovs relations with sonya but hedid not explain to himself what these new relations were theyrealways in love with someone he thought of sonya and natasha but hewas not as much at ease with sonya and dolokhov as before and was lessfrequently at homein the autumn of  everybody had again begun talking of the war withnapoleon with even greater warmth than the year before orders weregiven to raise recruits ten men in every thousand for the regular armyand besides this nine men in every thousand for the militia everywherebonaparte was anathematized and in moscow nothing but the coming war wastalked of for the rostov family the whole interest of thesepreparations for war lay in the fact that nicholas would not hear ofremaining in moscow and only awaited the termination of denisovsfurlough after christmas to return with him to their regiment hisapproaching departure did not prevent his amusing himself but rathergave zest to his pleasures he spent the greater part of his time awayfrom home at dinners parties and ballson the third day after christmas nicholas dined at home a thing he hadrarely done of late it was a grand farewell dinner as he and denisovwere leaving to join their regiment after epiphany about twenty peoplewere present including dolokhov and denisovnever had love been so much in the air and never had the amorousatmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the rostovs house as at thisholiday time seize the moments of happiness love and be loved thatis the only reality in the world all else is folly it is the one thingwe are interested in here said the spirit of the placenicholas having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses withoutvisiting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been invitedreturned home just before dinner as soon as he entered he noticed andfelt the tension of the amorous air in the house and also noticed acurious embarrassment among some of those present sonya dolokhov andthe old countess were especially disturbed and to a lesser degreenatasha nicholas understood that something must have happened betweensonya and dolokhov before dinner and with the kindly sensitivenessnatural to him was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner onthat same evening there was to be one of the balls that iogel thedancing master gave for his pupils during the holidaysnicholas will you come to iogels please do said natasha he askedyou and vasili dmitrich  is also going denisovwhere would i not go at the countess command said denisov who atthe rostovs had jocularly assumed the role of natashas knight imeven weady to dance the pas de chaleif i have time answered nicholas but i promised the arkharovs theyhave a partyand you he asked dolokhov but as soon as he had asked the questionhe noticed that it should not have been putperhaps coldly and angrily replied dolokhov glancing at sonya andscowling he gave nicholas just such a look as he had given pierre atthe club dinnerthere is something up thought nicholas and he was further confirmedin this conclusion by the fact that dolokhov left immediately afterdinner he called natasha and asked her what was the matterand i was looking for you said natasha running out to him i toldyou but you would not believe it she said triumphantly he hasproposed to sonyalittle as nicholas had occupied himself with sonya of late somethingseemed to give way within him at this news dolokhov was a suitable andin some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless orphan girl fromthe point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of thequestion for her to refuse him and therefore nicholas first feeling onhearing the news was one of anger with sonya he tried to saythats capital of course shell forget her childish promises andaccept the offer but before he had time to say it natasha began againand fancy she refused him quite definitely adding after a pauseshe told him she loved anotheryes my sonya could not have done otherwise thought nicholasmuch as mamma pressed her she refused and i know she wont changeonce she has saidand mamma pressed her said nicholas reproachfullyyes said natasha do you know nicholasdont be angrybut i knowyou will not marry her i know heaven knows how but i know for certainthat you wont marry hernow you dont know that at all said nicholas but i must talk toher what a darling sonya is he added with a smileah she is indeed a darling ill send her to youand natasha kissed her brother and ran awaya minute later sonya came in with a frightened guilty and scared looknicholas went up to her and kissed her hand this was the first timesince his return that they had talked alone and about their lovesophie he began timidly at first and then more and more boldly ifyou wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and advantageousmatch but a splendid noble fellow he is my friendsonya interrupted himi have already refused she said hurriedlyif you are refusing for my sake i am afraid that isonya again interrupted she gave him an imploring frightened looknicholas dont tell me that she saidno but i must it may be arrogant of me but still it is best to sayit if you refuse him on my account i must tell you the whole truth ilove you and i think i love you more than anyone elsethat is enough for me said sonya blushingno but i have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in loveagain though for no one have i such a feeling of friendshipconfidence and love as i have for you then i am young mamma does notwish it in a word i make no promise and i beg you to considerdolokhovs offer he said articulating his friends name withdifficultydont say that to me i want nothing i love you as a brother andalways shall and i want nothing moreyou are an angel i am not worthy of you but i am afraid of misleadingyouand nicholas again kissed her handiogels were the most enjoyable balls in moscow so said the mothers asthey watched their young people executing their newly learned steps andso said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced till they wereready to drop and so said the grownup young men and women who came tothese balls with an air of condescension and found them most enjoyablethat year two marriages had come of these balls the two pretty youngprincesses gorchakov met suitors there and were married and so furtherincreased the fame of these dances what distinguished them from otherswas the absence of host or hostess and the presence of the goodnaturediogel flying about like a feather and bowing according to the rules ofhis art as he collected the tickets from all his visitors there wasthe fact that only those came who wished to dance and amuse themselvesas girls of thirteen and fourteen do who are wearing long dresses forthe first time with scarcely any exceptions they all were or seemed tobe prettyso rapturous were their smiles and so sparkling their eyessometimes the best of the pupils of whom natasha who was exceptionallygraceful was first even danced the pas de chale but at this last ballonly the ecossaise the anglaise and the mazurka which was just cominginto fashion were danced iogel had taken a ballroom in bezukhovshouse and the ball as everyone said was a great success there weremany pretty girls and the rostov girls were among the prettiest theywere both particularly happy and gay that evening proud of dolokhovsproposal her refusal and her explanation with nicholas sonya twirledabout before she left home so that the maid could hardly get her hairplaited and she was transparently radiant with impulsive joynatasha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a realball was even happier they were both dressed in white muslin with pinkribbonsnatasha fell in love the very moment she entered the ballroom she wasnot in love with anyone in particular but with everyone whateverperson she happened to look at she was in love with for that momentoh how delightful it is she kept saying running up to sonyanicholas and denisov were walking up and down looking with kindlypatronage at the dancershow sweet she isshe will be a weal beauty said denisovwhocountess natasha answered denisovand how she dances what gwace he said again after a pausewho are you talking aboutabout your sister ejaculated denisov testilyrostov smiledmy dear count you were one of my best pupilsyou must dance saidlittle iogel coming up to nicholas look how many charming youngladies he turned with the same request to denisov who was also aformer pupil of hisno my dear fellow ill be a wallflower said denisov dont youwecollect what bad use i made of your lessonsoh no said iogel hastening to reassure him you were onlyinattentive but you had talentoh yes you had talentthe band struck up the newly introduced mazurka nicholas could notrefuse iogel and asked sonya to dance denisov sat down by the oldladies and leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot toldthem something funny and kept them amused while he watched the youngpeople dancing iogel with natasha his pride and his best pupil werethe first couple noiselessly skillfully stepping with his little feetin low shoes iogel flew first across the hall with natasha who thoughshy went on carefully executing her steps denisov did not take hiseyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearlyindicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and notbecause he could not in the middle of a figure he beckoned to rostovwho was passingthis is not at all the thing he said what sort of polish mazuwka isthis but she does dance splendidlyknowing that denisov had a reputation even in poland for the masterlyway in which he danced the mazurka nicholas ran up to natashago and choose denisov he is a real dancer a wonder he saidwhen it came to natashas turn to choose a partner she rose andtripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows rantimidly to the corner where denisov sat she saw that everybody waslooking at her and waiting nicholas saw that denisov was refusingthough he smiled delightedly he ran up to themplease vasili dmitrich natasha was saying do comeoh no let me off countess denisov repliednow then vaska said nicholasthey coax me as if i were vaska the cat said denisov jokinglyill sing for you a whole evening said natashaoh the faiwy she can do anything with me said denisov and heunhooked his saber he came out from behind the chairs clasped hispartners hand firmly threw back his head and advanced his footwaiting for the beat only on horse back and in the mazurka wasdenisovs short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow hefelt himself to be at the right beat of the music he looked sideways athis partner with a merry and triumphant air suddenly stamped with onefoot bounded from the floor like a ball and flew round the room takinghis partner with him he glided silently on one foot half across theroom and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at themwhen suddenly clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs he stoppedshort on his heels stood so a second stamped on the spot clanking hisspurs whirled rapidly round and striking his left heel against hisright flew round again in a circle natasha guessed what he meant todo and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardly knowing howfirst he spun her round holding her now with his left now with hisright hand then falling on one knee he twirled her round him and againjumping up dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if he wouldrush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath and thenhe suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected steps when atlast smartly whirling his partner round in front of her chair he drewup with a click of his spurs and bowed to her natasha did not even makehim a curtsy she fixed her eyes on him in amazement smiling as if shedid not recognize himwhat does this mean she brought outalthough iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka everyonewas delighted with denisovs skill he was asked again and again as apartner and the old men began smilingly to talk about poland and thegood old days denisov flushed after the mazurka and mopping himselfwith his handkerchief sat down by natasha and did not leave her for therest of the eveningfor two days after that rostov did not see dolokhov at his own or atdolokhovs home on the third day he received a note from himas i do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know ofand am going to rejoin my regiment i am giving a farewell suppertonight to my friendscome to the english hotelabout ten oclock rostov went to the english hotel straight from thetheater where he had been with his family and denisov he was at onceshown to the best room which dolokhov had taken for that evening sometwenty men were gathered round a table at which dolokhov sat between twocandles on the table was a pile of gold and paper money and he waskeeping the bank rostov had not seen him since his proposal and sonyasrefusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how they would meetdolokhovs clear cold glance met rostov as soon as he entered the dooras though he had long expected himits a long time since we met he said thanks for coming ill justfinish dealing and then ilyushka will come with his chorusi called once or twice at your house said rostov reddeningdolokhov made no replyyou may punt he saidrostov recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once hadwith dolokhov none but fools trust to luck in play dolokhov had thensaidor are you afraid to play with me dolokhov now asked as if guessingrostovs thoughtbeneath his smile rostov saw in him the mood he had shown at the clubdinner and at other times when as if tired of everyday life he had felta need to escape from it by some strange and usually cruel actionrostov felt ill at ease he tried but failed to find some joke withwhich to reply to dolokhovs words but before he had thought ofanything dolokhov looking straight in his face said slowly anddeliberately so that everyone could heardo you remember we had a talk about cards hes a fool who trusts toluck one should make certain and i want to tryto try his luck or the certainty rostov asked himselfwell youd better not play dolokhov added and springing a new packof cards said bank gentlemenmoving the money forward he prepared to deal rostov sat down by hisside and at first did not play dolokhov kept glancing at himwhy dont you play he askedand strange to say nicholas felt that he could not help taking up acard putting a small stake on it and beginning to playi have no money with me he saidill trust yourostov staked five rubles on a card and lost staked again and againlost dolokhov killed that is beat ten cards of rostovs runninggentlemen said dolokhov after he had dealt for some time pleaseplace your money on the cards or i may get muddled in the reckoningone of the players said he hoped he might be trustedyes you might but i am afraid of getting the accounts mixed so i askyou to put the money on your cards replied dolokhov dont stintyourself well settle afterwards he added turning to rostovthe game continued a waiter kept handing round champagneall rostovs cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scored upagainst him he wrote  rubles on a card but while the waiterfilled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to his usual stakeof twenty rublesleave it said dolokhov though he did not seem to be even looking atrostov youll win it back all the sooner i lose to the others but winfrom you or are you afraid of me he asked againrostov submitted he let the eight hundred remain and laid down a sevenof hearts with a torn corner which he had picked up from the floor hewell remembered that seven afterwards he laid down the seven of heartson which with a broken bit of chalk he had written  rubles in clearupright figures he emptied the glass of warm champagne that was handedhim smiled at dolokhovs words and with a sinking heart waiting for aseven to turn up gazed at dolokhovs hands which held the pack muchdepended on rostovs winning or losing on that seven of hearts on theprevious sunday the old count had given his son two thousand rubles andthough he always disliked speaking of money difficulties had toldnicholas that this was all he could let him have till may and asked himto be more economical this time nicholas had replied that it would bemore than enough for him and that he gave his word of honor not to takeanything more till the spring now only twelve hundred rubles was leftof that money so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only theloss of sixteen hundred rubles but the necessity of going back on hisword with a sinking heart he watched dolokhovs hands and thought nowthen make haste and let me have this card and ill take my cap anddrive home to supper with denisov natasha and sonya and willcertainly never touch a card again at that moment his home life jokeswith petya talks with sonya duets with natasha piquet with hisfather and even his comfortable bed in the house on the povarskaya rosebefore him with such vividness clearness and charm that it seemed asif it were all a lost and unappreciated bliss long past he could notconceive that a stupid chance letting the seven be dealt to the rightrather than to the left might deprive him of all this happiness newlyappreciated and newly illumined and plunge him into the depths ofunknown and undefined misery that could not be yet he awaited with asinking heart the movement of dolokhovs hands those broad reddishhands with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs laid downthe pack and took up a glass and a pipe that were handed himso you are not afraid to play with me repeated dolokhov and as ifabout to tell a good story he put down the cards leaned back in hischair and began deliberately with a smileyes gentlemen ive been told theres a rumor going about moscow thatim a sharper so i advise you to be carefulcome now deal exclaimed rostovoh those moscow gossips said dolokhov and he took up the cards witha smileaah rostov almost screamed lifting both hands to his head the sevenhe needed was lying uppermost the first card in the pack he had lostmore than he could paystill dont ruin yourself said dolokhov with a side glance at rostovas he continued to dealan hour and a half later most of the players were but little interestedin their own playthe whole interest was concentrated on rostov instead of sixteenhundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him whichhe had reckoned up to ten thousand but that now as he vaguelysupposed must have risen to fifteen thousand in reality it alreadyexceeded twenty thousand rubles dolokhov was no longer listening tostories or telling them but followed every movement of rostovs handsand occasionally ran his eyes over the score against him he had decidedto play until that score reached fortythree thousand he had fixed onthat number because fortythree was the sum of his and sonyas jointages rostov leaning his head on both hands sat at the table which wasscrawled over with figures wet with spilled wine and littered withcards one tormenting impression did not leave him that those broadboned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from under the shirtsleeves those hands which he loved and hated held him in their powersix hundred rubles ace a corner a nine winning it backsimpossible oh how pleasant it was at home the knave double orquits it cant be and why is he doing this to me rostovpondered sometimes he staked a large sum but dolokhov refused toaccept it and fixed the stake himself nicholas submitted to him and atone moment prayed to god as he had done on the battlefield at the bridgeover the enns and then guessed that the card that came first to handfrom the crumpled heap under the table would save him now counted thecords on his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking thetotal of his losses on it then he looked round for aid from the otherplayers or peered at the now cold face of dolokhov and tried to readwhat was passing in his mindhe knows of course what this loss means to me he cant want my ruinwasnt he my friend wasnt i fond of him but its not his faultwhats he to do if he has such luck and its not my fault eitherhe thought to himself i have done nothing wrong have i killed anyoneor insulted or wished harm to anyone why such a terrible misfortuneand when did it begin such a little while ago i came to this table withthe thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that casket for mammasname day and then going home i was so happy so free so lightheartedand i did not realize how happy i was when did that end and when didthis new terrible state of things begin what marked the change i satall the time in this same place at this table chose and placed cardsand watched those broadboned agile hands in the same way when did ithappen and what has happened i am well and strong and still the sameand in the same place no it cant be surely it will all end innothinghe was flushed and bathed in perspiration though the room was not hothis face was terrible and piteous to see especially from its helplessefforts to seem calmthe score against him reached the fateful sum of fortythree thousandrostov had just prepared a card by bending the corner of which he meantto double the three thousand just put down to his score when dolokhovslamming down the pack of cards put it aside and began rapidly addingup the total of rostovs debt breaking the chalk as he marked thefigures in his clear bold handsupper its time for supper and here are the gypsiessome swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold outsideand saying something in their gypsy accents nicholas understood that itwas all over but he said in an indifferent tonewell wont you go on i had a splendid card all ready as if it werethe fun of the game which interested him mostits all up im lost thought he now a bullet through my brainthats all thats left me and at the same time he said in a cheerfulvoicecome now just this one more little cardall right said dolokhov having finished the addition all righttwentyone rubles he said pointing to the figure twentyone by whichthe total exceeded the round sum of fortythree thousand and taking upa pack he prepared to deal rostov submissively unbent the corner of hiscard and instead of the six thousand he had intended carefully wrotetwentyoneits all the same to me he said i only want to see whether you willlet me win this ten or beat itdolokhov began to deal seriously oh how rostov detested at that momentthose hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists whichheld him in their power the ten fell to himyou owe fortythree thousand count said dolokhov and stretchinghimself he rose from the table one does get tired sitting so long headdedyes im tired too said rostovdolokhov cut him short as if to remind him that it was not for him tojestwhen am i to receive the money countrostov flushing drew dolokhov into the next roomi cannot pay it all immediately will you take an iou he saidi say rostov said dolokhov clearly smiling and looking nicholasstraight in the eyes you know the saying lucky in love unlucky atcards your cousin is in love with you i knowoh its terrible to feel oneself so in this mans power thoughtrostov he knew what a shock he would inflict on his father and motherby the news of this loss he knew what a relief it would be to escape itall and felt that dolokhov knew that he could save him from all thisshame and sorrow but wanted now to play with him as a cat does with amouseyour cousin dolokhov started to say but nicholas interrupted himmy cousin has nothing to do with this and its not necessary to mentionher he exclaimed fiercelythen when am i to have ittomorrow replied rostov and left the roomto say tomorrow and keep up a dignified tone was not difficult but togo home alone see his sisters brother mother and father confess andask for money he had no right to after giving his word of honor wasterribleat home they had not yet gone to bed the young people after returningfrom the theater had had supper and were grouped round the clavichordas soon as nicholas entered he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphereof love which pervaded the rostov household that winter and now afterdolokhovs proposal and iogels ball seemed to have grown thicker roundsonya and natasha as the air does before a thunderstorm sonya andnatasha in the lightblue dresses they had worn at the theater lookingpretty and conscious of it were standing by the clavichord happy andsmiling vera was playing chess with shinshin in the drawing room theold countess waiting for the return of her husband and son sat playingpatience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house denisovwith sparkling eyes and ruffled hair sat at the clavichord strikingchords with his short fingers his legs thrown back and his eyes rollingas he sang with his small husky but true voice some verses calledenchantress which he had composed and to which he was trying to fitmusicenchantress say to my forsaken lyre what magic power is this recallsme still what spark has set my inmost soul on fire what is this blissthat makes my fingers thrillhe was singing in passionate tones gazing with his sparkling blackagate eyes at the frightened and happy natashasplendid excellent exclaimed natasha another verse she saidwithout noticing nicholaseverythings still the same with them thought nicholas glancing intothe drawing room where he saw vera and his mother with the old ladyah and heres nicholas cried natasha running up to himis papa at home he askedi am so glad youve come said natasha without answering him we areenjoying ourselves vasili dmitrich is staying a day longer for my sakedid you knowno papa is not back yet said sonyanicholas have you come come here dear called the old countess fromthe drawing roomnicholas went to her kissed her hand and sitting down silently at hertable began to watch her hands arranging the cards from the dancingroom they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to persuadenatasha to singall wight all wight shouted denisov its no good making excusesnow its your turn to sing the bacawollai entweat youthe countess glanced at her silent sonwhat is the matter she askedoh nothing said he as if weary of being continually asked the samequestion will papa be back sooni expect soeverythings the same with them they know nothing about it where am ito go thought nicholas and went again into the dancing room where theclavichord stoodsonya was sitting at the clavichord playing the prelude to denisovsfavorite barcarolle natasha was preparing to sing denisov was lookingat her with enraptured eyesnicholas began pacing up and down the roomwhy do they want to make her sing how can she sing theres nothing tobe happy about thought hesonya struck the first chord of the preludemy god im a ruined and dishonored man a bullet through my brain isthe only thing left menot singing his thoughts ran on go away butwhere to its onelet them singhe continued to pace the room looking gloomily at denisov and the girlsand avoiding their eyesnikolenka what is the matter sonyas eyes fixed on him seemed toask she noticed at once that something had happened to himnicholas turned away from her natasha too with her quick instinct hadinstantly noticed her brothers condition but though she noticed itshe was herself in such high spirits at that moment so far from sorrowsadness or selfreproach that she purposely deceived herself as youngpeople often do no i am too happy now to spoil my enjoyment bysympathy with anyones sorrow she felt and she said to herself noi must be mistaken he must be feeling happy just as i amnow sonya she said going to the very middle of the room where sheconsidered the resonance was besthaving lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly as balletdancers do natasha rising energetically from her heels to her toesstepped to the middle of the room and stood stillyes thats me she seemed to say answering the rapt gaze with whichdenisov followed herand what is she so pleased about thought nicholas looking at hissister why isnt she dull and ashamednatasha took the first note her throat swelled her chest rose hereyes became serious at that moment she was oblivious of hersurroundings and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone mayproduce at the same intervals and hold for the same time but whichleave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrillyou and make you weepnatasha that winter had for the first time begun to sing seriouslymainly because denisov so delighted in her singing she no longer sangas a child there was no longer in her singing that comical childishpainstaking effect that had been in it before but she did not yet singwell as all the connoisseurs who heard her said it is not trainedbut it is a beautiful voice that must be trained only they generallysaid this some time after she had finished singing while that untrainedvoice with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions wassounding even the connoisseurs said nothing but only delighted in itand wished to hear it again in her voice there was a virginalfreshness an unconsciousness of her own powers and an as yet untrainedvelvety softness which so mingled with her lack of art in singing thatit seemed as if nothing in that voice could be altered without spoilingitwhat is this thought nicholas listening to her with widely openedeyes what has happened to her how she is singing today and suddenlythe whole world centered for him on anticipation of the next note thenext phrase and everything in the world was divided into three beatsoh mio crudele affetto one two three one two threeone oh mio crudele affetto one two three one oh thissenseless life of ours thought nicholas all this misery and moneyand dolokhov and anger and honorits all nonsense but this isreal now then natasha now then dearest now then darling howwill she take that si shes taken it thank god and without noticingthat he was singing to strengthen the si he sung a second a thirdbelow the high note ah god how fine did i really take it howfortunate he thoughtoh how that chord vibrated and how moved was something that was finestin rostovs soul and this something was apart from everything else inthe world and above everything in the world what were losses anddolokhov and words of honor all nonsense one might kill and roband yet be happyit was long since rostov had felt such enjoyment from music as he didthat day but no sooner had natasha finished her barcarolle than realityagain presented itself he got up without saying a word and wentdownstairs to his own room a quarter of an hour later the old countcame in from his club cheerful and contented nicholas hearing himdrive up went to meet himwellhad a good time said the old count smiling gaily and proudlyat his sonnicholas tried to say yes but could not and he nearly burst intosobs the count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his sonsconditionah it cant be avoided thought nicholas for the first and lasttime and suddenly in the most casual tone which made him feel ashamedof himself he said as if merely asking his father to let him have thecarriage to drive to townpapa i have come on a matter of business i was nearly forgetting ineed some moneydear me said his father who was in a specially good humor i toldyou it would not be enough how muchvery much said nicholas flushing and with a stupid careless smilefor which he was long unable to forgive himself i have lost a littlei mean a good deal a great dealforty three thousandwhat to whom nonsense cried the count suddenly reddening withan apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people doi promised to pay tomorrow said nicholaswell said the old count spreading out his arms and sinkinghelplessly on the sofait cant be helped it happens to everyone said the son with a boldfree and easy tone while in his soul he regarded himself as aworthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime helonged to kiss his fathers hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness butsaid in a careless and even rude voice that it happens to everyonethe old count cast down his eyes on hearing his sons words and beganbustlingly searching for somethingyes yes he muttered it will be difficult i fear difficult toraise happens to everybody yes who has not done itand with a furtive glance at his sons face the count went out of theroom nicholas had been prepared for resistance but had not at allexpected thispapa papa he called after him sobbing forgive me and seizinghis fathers hand he pressed it to his lips and burst into tearswhile father and son were having their explanation the mother anddaughter were having

the girls roomsonya was more tender and devoted to him than ever it was as if shewanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that made herlove him all the more but nicholas now considered himself unworthy ofherhe filled the girls albums with verses and music and having at lastsent dolokhov the whole fortythree thousand rubles and received hisreceipt he left at the end of november without taking leave of any ofhis acquaintances to overtake his regiment which was already in polandafter his interview with his wife pierre left for petersburg at thetorzhok post station either there were no horses or the postmasterwould not supply them pierre was obliged to wait without undressinghe lay down on the leather sofa in front of a round table put his bigfeet in their overboots on the table and began to reflectwill you have the portmanteaus brought in and a bed got ready andtea asked his valetpierre gave no answer for he neither heard nor saw anything he hadbegun to think of the last station and was still pondering on the samequestionone so important that he took no notice of what went on aroundhim not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to petersburgearlier or later or whether he secured accommodation at this stationbut compared to the thoughts that now occupied him it was a matter ofindifference whether he remained there for a few hours or for the restof his lifethe postmaster his wife the valet and a peasant woman selling torzhokembroidery came into the room offering their services without changinghis careless attitude pierre looked at them over his spectacles unableto understand what they wanted or how they could go on living withouthaving solved the problems that so absorbed him he had been engrossedby the same thoughts ever since the day he returned from sokolniki afterthe duel and had spent that first agonizing sleepless night but nowin the solitude of the journey they seized him with special force nomatter what he thought about he always returned to these same questionswhich he could not solve and yet could not cease to ask himself it wasas if the thread of the chief screw which held his life together werestripped so that the screw could not get in or out but went on turninguselessly in the same placethe postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his excellency towait only two hours when come what might he would let his excellencyhave the courier horses it was plain that he was lying and only wantedto get more money from the traveleris this good or bad pierre asked himself it is good for me bad foranother traveler and for himself its unavoidable because he needsmoney for food the man said an officer had once given him a thrashingfor letting a private traveler have the courier horses but the officerthrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as possible and icontinued pierre shot dolokhov because i considered myself injuredand louis xvi was executed because they considered him a criminal and ayear later they executed those who executed himalso for some reasonwhat is bad what is good what should one love and what hate what doesone live for and what am i what is life and what is death what powergoverns allthere was no answer to any of these questions except one and that nota logical answer and not at all a reply to them the answer was youlldie and all will end youll die and know all or cease asking butdying was also dreadfulthe torzhok peddler woman in a whining voice went on offering herwares especially a pair of goatskin slippers i have hundreds ofrubles i dont know what to do with and she stands in her tatteredcloak looking timidly at me he thought and what does she want themoney for as if that money could add a hairs breadth to happiness orpeace of mind can anything in the world make her or me less a prey toevil and deathdeath which ends all and must come today or tomorrowat any rate in an instant as compared with eternity and again hetwisted the screw with the stripped thread and again it turneduselessly in the same placehis servant handed him a halfcut novel in the form of letters bymadame de souza he began reading about the sufferings and virtuousstruggles of a certain emilie de mansfeld and why did she resist herseducer when she loved him he thought god could not have put intoher heart an impulse that was against his will my wifeas she oncewasdid not struggle and perhaps she was right nothing has been foundout nothing discovered pierre again said to himself all we can knowis that we know nothing and thats the height of human wisdomeverything within and around him seemed confused senseless andrepellent yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances pierrefound a kind of tantalizing satisfactioni make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for thisgentleman said the postmaster entering the room followed by anothertraveler also detained for lack of horsesthe newcomer was a short largeboned yellowfaced wrinkled old manwith gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinitegrayish colorpierre took his feet off the table stood up and lay down on a bed thathad been got ready for him glancing now and then at the newcomer whowith a gloomy and tired face was wearily taking off his wraps with theaid of his servant and not looking at pierre with a pair of felt bootson his thin bony legs and keeping on a worn nankeencovered sheepskincoat the traveler sat down on the sofa leaned back his big head withits broad temples and closecropped hair and looked at bezukhov thestern shrewd and penetrating expression of that look struck pierre hefelt a wish to speak to the stranger but by the time he had made up hismind to ask him a question about the roads the traveler had closed hiseyes his shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one ofthem pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing adeaths head the stranger sat without stirring either resting or asit seemed to pierre sunk in profound and calm meditation his servantwas also a yellow wrinkled old man without beard or mustacheevidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grownthis active old servant was unpacking the travelers canteen andpreparing tea he brought in a boiling samovar when everything wasready the stranger opened his eyes moved to the table filled atumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whomhe passed it pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness and the needeven the inevitability of entering into conversation with thisstrangerthe servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down  with anunfinished bit of nibbled sugar and asked if anything more would bewanted to indicate he did not want more teano give me the book said the strangerthe servant handed him a book which pierre took to be a devotional workand the traveler became absorbed in it pierre looked at him all atonce the stranger closed the book putting in a marker and againleaning with his arms on the back of the sofa sat in his formerposition with his eyes shut pierre looked at him and had not time toturn away when the old man opening his eyes fixed his steady andsevere gaze straight on pierres facepierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look but the bright oldeyes attracted him irresistiblyi have the pleasure of addressing count bezukhov if i am notmistaken said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voicepierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectaclesi have heard of you my dear sir continued the stranger and of yourmisfortune he seemed to emphasize the last word as if to sayyesmisfortune call it what you please i know that what happened to you inmoscow was a misfortunei regret it very much my dear sirpierre flushed and hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed bentforward toward the old man with a forced and timid smilei have not referred to this out of curiosity my dear sir but forgreater reasonshe paused his gaze still on pierre and moved aside on the sofa by wayof inviting the other to take a seat beside him pierre felt reluctantto enter into conversation with this old man but submitting to himinvoluntarily came up and sat down beside himyou are unhappy my dear sir the stranger continued you are youngand i am old i should like to help you as far as lies in my poweroh yes said pierre with a forced smile i am very grateful to youwhere are you traveling fromthe strangers face was not genial it was even cold and severe but inspite of this both the face and words of his new acquaintance wereirresistibly attractive to pierrebut if for reason you dont feel inclined to talk to me said the oldman say so my dear sir and he suddenly smiled in an unexpected andtenderly paternal wayoh no not at all on the contrary i am very glad to make youracquaintance said pierre and again glancing at the strangers handshe looked more closely at the ring with its skulla masonic signallow me to ask he said are you a masonyes i belong to the brotherhood of the freemasons said the strangerlooking deeper and deeper into pierres eyes and in their name and myown i hold out a brotherly hand to youi am afraid said pierre smiling and wavering between the confidencethe personality of the freemason inspired in him and his own habit ofridiculing the masonic beliefsi am afraid i am very far fromunderstandinghow am i to put iti am afraid my way of looking at theworld is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one anotheri know your outlook said the mason and the view of life youmention and which you think is the result of your own mental effortsis the one held by the majority of people and is the invariable fruitof pride indolence and ignorance forgive me my dear sir but if ihad not known it i should not have addressed you your view of life is aregrettable delusionjust as i may suppose you to be deluded said pierre with a faintsmilei should never dare to say that i know the truth said the masonwhose words struck pierre more and more by their precision and firmnessno one can attain to truth by himself only by laying stone on stonewith the cooperation of all by the millions of generations from ourforefather adam to our own times is that temple reared which is to be aworthy dwelling place of the great god he added and closed his eyesi ought to tell you that i do not believe do not believe in godsaid pierre regretfully and with an effort feeling it essential tospeak the whole truththe mason looked intently at pierre and smiled as a rich man withmillions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he poorman had not the five rubles that would make him happyyes you do not know him my dear sir said the mason you cannotknow him you do not know him and that is why you are unhappyyes yes i am unhappy assented pierre but what am i to doyou know him not my dear sir and so you are very unhappy you do notknow him but he is here he is in me he is in my words he is in theeand even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered pronouncedthe mason in a stern and tremulous voicehe paused and sighed evidently trying to calm himselfif he were not he said quietly you and i would not be speaking ofhim my dear sir of what of whom are we speaking whom hast thoudenied he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and authority in hisvoice who invented him if he did not exist whence came thyconception of the existence of such an incomprehensible being didstthou and why did the whole world conceive the idea of the existence ofsuch an incomprehensible being a being allpowerful eternal andinfinite in all his attributeshe stopped and remained silent for a long timepierre could not and did not wish to break this silencehe exists but to understand him is hard the mason began againlooking not at pierre but straight before him and turning the leaves ofhis book with his old hands which from excitement he could not keepstill if it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt i could bringhim to thee could take him by the hand and show him to thee but howcan i an insignificant mortal show his omnipotence his infinity andall his mercy to one who is blind or who shuts his eyes that he may notsee or understand him and may not see or understand his own vileness andsinfulness he paused again who art thou thou dreamest that thou artwise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous words he went onwith a somber and scornful smile and thou art more foolish andunreasonable than a little child who playing with the parts of askillfully made watch dares to say that as he does not understand itsuse he does not believe in the master who made it to know him ishard for ages from our forefather adam to our own day we labor toattain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim but inour lack of understanding we see only our weakness and hisgreatnesspierre listened with swelling heart gazing into the masons face withshining eyes not interrupting or questioning him but believing withhis whole soul what the stranger said whether he accepted the wisereasoning contained in the masons words or believed as a childbelieves in the speakers tone of conviction and earnestness or thetremor of the speakers voicewhich sometimes almost brokeor thosebrilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction or the calm firmnessand certainty of his vocation which radiated from his whole being andwhich struck pierre especially by contrast with his own dejection andhopelessnessat any rate pierre longed with his whole soul to believeand he did believe and felt a joyful sense of comfort regenerationand return to lifehe is not to be apprehended by reason but by life said the masoni do not understand said pierre feeling with dismay doubtsreawakening he was afraid of any want of clearness any weakness inthe masons arguments he dreaded not to be able to believe in him idont understand he said how it is that the mind of man cannotattain the knowledge of which you speakthe mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smilethe highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish toimbibe he said can i receive that pure liquid into an impure vesseland judge of its purity only by the inner purification of myself can iretain in some degree of purity the liquid i receiveyes yes that is so said pierre joyfullythe highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone not on those worldlysciences of physics history chemistry and the like into whichintellectual knowledge is divided the highest wisdom is one thehighest wisdom has but one sciencethe science of the wholethescience explaining the whole creation and mans place in it to receivethat science it is necessary to purify and renew ones inner self andso before one can know it is necessary to believe and to perfect onesself and to attain this end we have the light called conscience thatgod has implanted in our soulsyes yes assented pierrelook then at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit and askthyself whether thou art content with thyself what hast thou attainedrelying on reason only what art thou you are young you are rich youare clever you are well educated and what have you done with all thesegood gifts are you content with yourself and with your lifeno i hate my life pierre muttered wincingthou hatest it then change it purify thyself and as thou artpurified thou wilt gain wisdom look at your life my dear sir howhave you spent it in riotous orgies and debauchery receivingeverything from society and giving nothing in return you have becomethe possessor of wealth how have you used it what have you done foryour neighbor have you ever thought of your tens of thousands ofslaves have you helped them physically and morally no you haveprofited by their toil to lead a profligate life that is what you havedone have you chosen a post in which you might be of service to yourneighbor no you have spent your life in idleness then you married mydear sirtook on yourself responsibility for the guidance of a youngwoman and what have you done you have not helped her to find the wayof truth my dear sir but have thrust her into an abyss of deceit andmisery a man offended you and you shot him and you say you do not knowgod and hate your life there is nothing strange in that my dear sirafter these words the mason as if tired by his long discourse againleaned his arms on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes pierrelooked at that aged stern motionless almost lifeless face and movedhis lips without uttering a sound he wished to say yes a vile idlevicious life but dared not break the silencethe mason cleared his throat huskily as old men do and called hisservanthow about the horses he asked without looking at pierrethe exchange horses have just come answered the servant will younot rest hereno tell them to harnesscan he really be going away leaving me alone without having told meall and without promising to help me thought pierre rising withdowncast head and he began to pace the room glancing occasionally atthe mason yes i never thought of it but i have led a contemptibleand profligate life though i did not like it and did not want tothought pierre but this man knows the truth and if he wished tocould disclose it to mepierre wished to say this to the mason but did not dare to thetraveler having packed his things with his practiced hands beganfastening his coat when he had finished he turned to bezukhov andsaid in a tone of indifferent politenesswhere are you going to now my dear siri im going to petersburg answered pierre in a childlikehesitating voice i thank you i agree with all you have said but donot suppose me to be so bad with my whole soul i wish to be what youwould have me be but i have never had help from anyone but it is iabove all who am to blame for everything help me teach me andperhaps i maypierre could not go on he gulped and turned awaythe mason remained silent for a long time evidently consideringhelp comes from god alone he said but such measure of help as ourorder can bestow it will render you my dear sir you are going topetersburg hand this to count willarski he took out his notebook andwrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in four allow meto give you a piece of advice when you reach the capital first of alldevote some time to solitude and selfexamination and do not resume yourformer way of life and now i wish you a good journey my dear sir headded seeing that his servant had entered and successthe traveler was joseph alexeevich bazdeev as pierre saw from thepostmasters book bazdeev had been one of the bestknown freemasons andmartinists even in novikovs time for a long while after he had gonepierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and down the roompondering over his vicious past and with a rapturous sense of beginninganew pictured to himself the blissful irreproachable virtuous futurethat seemed to him so easy it seemed to him that he had been viciousonly because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to be virtuous nota trace of his former doubts remained in his soul he firmly believed inthe possibility of the brotherhood of men united in the aim ofsupporting one another in the path of virtue and that is howfreemasonry presented itself to himon reaching petersburg pierre did not let anyone know of his arrival hewent nowhere and spent whole days in reading thomas a kempis whose bookhad been sent him by someone unknown one thing he continually realizedas he read that book the joy hitherto unknown to him of believing inthe possibility of attaining perfection and in the possibility ofactive brotherly love among men which joseph alexeevich had revealed tohim a week after his arrival the young polish count willarski whompierre had known slightly in petersburg society came into his room oneevening in the official and ceremonious manner in which dolokhovssecond had called on him and having closed the door behind him andsatisfied himself that there was nobody else in the room addressedpierrei have come to you with a message and an offer count he said withoutsitting down a person of very high standing in our brotherhood hasmade application for you to be received into our order before the usualterm and has proposed to me to be your sponsor i consider it a sacredduty to fulfill that persons wishes do you wish to enter thebrotherhood of freemasons under my sponsorshipthe cold austere tone of this man whom he had almost always before metat balls amiably smiling in the society of the most brilliant womensurprised pierreyes i do wish it said hewillarski bowed his headone more question count he said which i beg you to answer in allsinceritynot as a future mason but as an honest man have yourenounced your former convictionsdo you believe in godpierre consideredyes yes i believe in god he saidin that case began willarski but pierre interrupted himyes i do believe in god he repeatedin that case we can go said willarski my carriage is at yourservicewillarski was silent throughout the drive to pierres inquiries as towhat he must do and how he should answer willarski only replied thatbrothers more worthy than he would test him and that pierre had only totell the truthhaving entered the courtyard of a large house where the lodge had itsheadquarters and having ascended a dark staircase they entered a smallwelllit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the aid of aservant from there they passed into another room a man in strangeattire appeared at the door willarski stepping toward him saidsomething to him in french in an undertone and then went up to a smallwardrobe in which pierre noticed garments such as he had never seenbefore having taken a kerchief from the cupboard willarski boundpierres eyes with it and tied it in a knot behind catching some hairspainfully in the knot then he drew his face down kissed him andtaking him by the hand led him forward the hairs tied in the knot hurtpierre and there were lines of pain on his face and a shamefaced smilehis huge figure with arms hanging down and with a puckered thoughsmiling face moved after willarski with uncertain timid stepshaving led him about ten paces willarski stoppedwhatever happens to you he said you must bear it all manfully ifyou have firmly resolved to join our brotherhood pierre noddedaffirmatively when you hear a knock at the door you will uncoveryour eyes added willarski i wish you courage and success andpressing pierres hand he went outleft alone pierre went on smiling in the same way once or twice heshrugged his shoulders and raised his hand to the kerchief as ifwishing to take it off but let it drop again the five minutes spentwith his eyes bandaged seemed to him an hour his arms felt numb hislegs almost gave way it seemed to him that he was tired out heexperienced a variety of most complex sensations he felt afraid of whatwould happen to him and still more afraid of showing his fear he feltcurious to know what was going to happen and what would be revealed tohim but most of all he felt joyful that the moment had come when hewould at last start on that path of regeneration and on the activelyvirtuous life of which he had been dreaming since he met josephalexeevich loud knocks were heard at the door pierre took the bandageoff his eyes and glanced around him the room was in black darknessonly a small lamp was burning inside something white pierre went nearerand saw that the lamp stood on a black table on which lay an open bookthe book was the gospel and the white thing with the lamp inside was ahuman skull with its cavities and teeth after reading the first wordsof the gospel in the beginning was the word and the word was withgod pierre went round the table and saw a large open box filled withsomething it was a coffin with bones inside he was not at allsurprised by what he saw hoping to enter on an entirely new life quiteunlike the old one he expected everything to be unusual even moreunusual than what he was seeing a skull a coffin the gospelitseemed to him that he had expected all this and even more trying tostimulate his emotions he looked around god death love thebrotherhood of man he kept saying to himself associating these wordswith vague yet joyful ideas the door opened and someone came inby the dim light to which pierre had already become accustomed he sawa rather short man having evidently come from the light into thedarkness the man paused then moved with cautious steps toward thetable and placed on it his small leathergloved handsthis short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest andpart of his legs he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a highwhite ruffle outlining his rather long face which was lit up frombelowfor what have you come hither asked the newcomer turning in pierresdirection at a slight rustle made by the latter why have you who donot believe in the truth of the light and who have not seen the lightcome here what do you seek from us wisdom virtue enlightenmentat the moment the door opened and the stranger came in pierre felt asense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood atconfession he felt himself in the presence of one socially a completestranger yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man with batedbreath and beating heart he moved toward the rhetor by which name thebrother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the brotherhood wasknown drawing nearer he recognized in the rhetor a man he knewsmolyaninov and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was anacquaintancehe wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructorfor a long time he could not utter a word so that the rhetor had torepeat his questionyes i i desire regeneration pierre uttered with difficultyvery well said smolyaninov and went on at once have you any ideaof the means by which our holy order will help you to reach your aimsaid he quietly and quicklyi hope for guidance help in regeneration said pierrewith a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance due to hisexcitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters inrussianwhat is your conception of freemasonryi imagine that freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men whohave virtuous aims said pierre feeling ashamed of the inadequacy ofhis words for the solemnity of the moment as he spoke i imaginegood said the rhetor quickly apparently satisfied with this answerhave you sought for means of attaining your aim in religionno i considered it erroneous and did not follow it said pierre sosoftly that the rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he wassaying i have been an atheist answered pierreyou are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your lifetherefore you seek wisdom and virtue is that not so said the rhetorafter a moments pauseyes yes assented pierrethe rhetor cleared his throat crossed his gloved hands on his breastand began to speaknow i must disclose to you the chief aim of our order he said andif this aim coincides with yours you may enter our brotherhood withprofit the first and chief object of our order the foundation on whichit rests and which no human power can destroy is the preservation andhanding on to posterity of a certain important mystery which has comedown to us from the remotest ages even from the first mana mystery onwhich perhaps the fate of mankind depends but since this mystery is ofsuch a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be prepared bylong and diligent selfpurification not everyone can hope to attain itquickly hence we have a secondary aim that of preparing our members asmuch as possible to reform their hearts to purify and enlighten theirminds by means handed on to us by tradition from those who have strivento attain this mystery and thereby to render them capable of receivingitby purifying and regenerating our members we try thirdly to improvethe whole human race offering it in our members an example of piety andvirtue and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil whichsways the world think this over and i will come to you againto combat the evil which sways the world pierre repeated and amental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mindhe imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago and headdressed an edifying exhortation to them he imagined to himselfvicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deedimagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue of the three objectsmentioned by the rhetor this last that of improving mankindespecially appealed to pierre the important mystery mentioned by therhetor though it aroused his curiosity did not seem to him essentialand the second aim that of purifying and regenerating himself did notmuch interest him because at that moment he felt with delight that hewas already perfectly cured of his former faults and was ready for allthat was goodhalf an hour later the rhetor returned to inform the seeker of theseven virtues corresponding to the seven steps of solomons templewhich every freemason should cultivate in himself these virtues were discretion the keeping of the secrets of the order  obedience tothose of higher ranks in the order  morality  love of mankind courage  generosity  the love of deathin the seventh place try by the frequent thought of death therhetor said to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe butas a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue fromthis distressful life and leads it to its place of recompense andpeaceyes that must be so thought pierre when after these words therhetor went away leaving him to solitary meditation it must be sobut i am still so weak that i love my life the meaning of which is onlynow gradually opening before me but five of the other virtues whichpierre recalled counting them on his fingers he felt already in hissoul courage generosity morality love of mankind and especiallyobediencewhich did not even seem to him a virtue but a joy he nowfelt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his willto those who knew the indubitable truth he forgot what the seventhvirtue was and could not recall itthe third time the rhetor came back more quickly and asked pierrewhether he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit toall that would be required of himi am ready for everything said pierrei must also inform you said the rhetor that our order delivers itsteaching not in words only but also by other means which may perhapshave a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdom and virtuethan mere words this chamber with what you see therein should alreadyhave suggested to your heart if it is sincere more than words coulddo you will perhaps also see in your further initiation a like methodof enlightenment our order imitates the ancient societies thatexplained their teaching by hieroglyphics a hieroglyph said therhetor is an emblem of something not cognizable by the senses butwhich possesses qualities resembling those of the symbolpierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was but dared not speak helistened to the rhetor in silence feeling from all he said that hisordeal was about to beginif you are resolved i must begin your initiation said the rhetorcoming closer to pierre in token of generosity i ask you to give meall your valuablesbut i have nothing here replied pierre supposing that he was askedto give up all he possessedwhat you have with you watch money ringspierre quickly took out his purse and watch but could not manage forsome time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger when that had beendone the rhetor saidin token of obedience i ask you to undresspierre took off his coat waistcoat and left boot according to therhetors instructions the mason drew the shirt back from pierres leftbreast and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousers toabove the knee pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot alsoand was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger thetrouble but the mason told him that was not necessary and gave him aslipper for his left foot with a childlike smile of embarrassmentdoubt and selfderision which appeared on his face against his willpierre stood with his arms hanging down and legs apart before hisbrother rhetor and awaited his further commandsand now in token of candor i ask you to reveal to me your chiefpassion said the lattermy passion i have had so many replied pierrethat passion which more than all others caused you to waver on the pathof virtue said the masonpierre paused seeking a replywine gluttony idleness laziness irritability anger women hewent over his vices in his mind not knowing to which of them to givethe preeminencewomen he said in a low scarcely audible voicethe mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after thisanswer at last he moved up to pierre and taking the kerchief that layon the table again bound his eyesfor the last time i say to youturn all your attention upon yourselfput a bridle on your senses and seek blessedness not in passion but inyour own heart the source of blessedness is not without us butwithinpierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing sourceof blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotionsoon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch pierre notthe rhetor but pierres sponsor willarski whom he recognized by hisvoice to fresh questions as to the firmness of his resolution pierrereplied yes yes i agree and with a beaming childlike smile hisfat chest uncovered stepping unevenly and timidly in one slippered andone booted foot he advanced while willarski held a sword to his barechest he was conducted from that room along passages that turnedbackwards and forwards and was at last brought to the doors of thelodge willarski coughed he was answered by the masonic knock withmallets the doors opened before them a bass voice pierre was stillblindfolded questioned him as to who he was when and where he wasborn and so on then he was again led somewhere still blindfolded andas they went along he was told allegories of the toils of hispilgrimage of holy friendship of the eternal architect of theuniverse and of the courage with which he should endure toils anddangers during these wanderings pierre noticed that he was spoken ofnow as the seeker now as the sufferer and now as the postulantto the accompaniment of various knockings with mallets and swords as hewas being led up to some object he noticed a hesitation and uncertaintyamong his conductors he heard those around him disputing in whispersand one of them insisting that he should be led along a certain carpetafter that they took his right hand placed it on something and toldhim to hold a pair of compasses to his left breast with the other handand to repeat after someone who read aloud an oath of fidelity to thelaws of the order the candles were then extinguished and some spiritlighted as pierre knew by the smell and he was told that he would nowsee the lesser light the bandage was taken off his eyes and by thefaint light of the burning spirit pierre as in a dream saw severalmen standing before him wearing aprons like the rhetors and holdingswords in their hands pointed at his breast among them stood a manwhose white shirt was stained with blood on seeing this pierre movedforward with his breast toward the swords meaning them to pierce itbut the swords were drawn back from him and he was at once blindfoldedagainnow thou hast seen the lesser light uttered a voice then the candleswere relit and he was told that he would see the full light the bandagewas again removed and more than ten voices said together sic transitgloria mundipierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the roomand at the people in it round a long table covered with black sat sometwelve men in garments like those he had already seen some of thempierre had met in petersburg society in the presidents chair sat ayoung man he did not know with a peculiar cross hanging from his neckon his right sat the italian abbe whom pierre had met at anna pavlovnastwo years before there were also present a very distinguished dignitaryand a swiss who had formerly been tutor at the kuragins all maintaineda solemn silence listening to the words of the president who held amallet in his hand let into the wall was a starshaped light at oneside of the table was a small carpet with various figures worked uponit at the other was something resembling an altar on which lay atestament and a skull round it stood seven large candlesticks likethose used in churches two of the brothers led pierre up to the altarplaced his feet at right angles and bade him lie down saying that hemust prostrate himself at the gates of the templehe must first receive the trowel whispered one of the brothersoh hush please said anotherpierre perplexed looked round with his shortsighted eyes withoutobeying and suddenly doubts arose in his mind where am i what am idoing arent they laughing at me shant i be ashamed to rememberthis but these doubts only lasted a moment pierre glanced at theserious faces of those around remembered all he had already gonethrough and realized that he could not stop halfway he was aghast athis hesitation and trying to arouse his former devotional feelingprostrated himself before the gates of the temple and really thefeeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before whenhe had lain there some time he was told to get up and a white leatherapron such as the others wore was put on him he was given a troweland three pairs of gloves and then the grand master addressed him hetold him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of thatapron which symbolized strength and purity then of the unexplainedtrowel he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from viceand indulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbor as to thefirst pair of gloves a mans he said that pierre could not know theirmeaning but must keep them the second pair of mans gloves he was towear at the meetings and finally of the third a pair of womensgloves he said dear brother these womans gloves are intended foryou too give them to the woman whom you shall honor most of all thisgift will be a pledge of your purity of heart to her whom you select tobe your worthy helpmeet in masonry and after a pause he added butbeware dear brother that these gloves do not deck hands that areunclean while the grand master said these last words it seemed topierre that he grew embarrassed pierre himself grew still moreconfused blushed like a child till tears came to his eyes beganlooking about him uneasily and an awkward pause followedthis silence was broken by one of the brethren who led pierre up to therug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation ofall the figures on it the sun the moon a hammer a plumb line atrowel a rough stone and a squared stone a pillar three windows andso on then a place was assigned to pierre he was shown the signs ofthe lodge told the password and at last was permitted to sit down thegrand master began reading the statutes they were very long andpierre from joy agitation and embarrassment was not in a state tounderstand what was being read he managed to follow only the last wordsof the statutes and these remained in his mindin our temples we recognize no other distinctions read the grandmaster but those between virtue and vice beware of making anydistinctions which may infringe equality fly to a brothers aid whoeverhe may be exhort him who goeth astray raise him that falleth neverbear malice or enmity toward thy brother be kindly and courteouskindle in all hearts the flame of virtue share thy happiness with thyneighbor and may envy never dim the purity of that bliss forgive thyenemy do not avenge thyself except by doing him good thus fulfillingthe highest law thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity whichthou hast losthe finished and getting up embraced and kissed pierre who with tearsof joy in his eyes looked round him not knowing how to answer thecongratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on allsides he acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men onlybrothers and burned with impatience to set to work with themthe grand master rapped with his mallet all the masons sat down intheir places and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity ofhumilitythe grand master proposed that the last duty should be performed andthe distinguished dignitary who bore the title of collector of almswent round to all the brothers pierre would have liked to subscribe allhe had but fearing that it might look like pride subscribed the sameamount as the othersthe meeting was at an end and on reaching home pierre felt as if he hadreturned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years hadbecome completely changed and had quite left behind his former habitsand way of lifethe day after he had been received into the lodge pierre was sitting athome reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the squareone side of which symbolized god another moral things a third physicalthings and the fourth a combination of these now and then hisattention wandered from the book and the square and he formed inimagination a new plan of life on the previous evening at the lodge hehad heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the emperor and that itwould be wiser for him to leave petersburg pierre proposed going to hisestates in the south and there attending to the welfare of his serfs hewas joyfully planning this new life when prince vasili suddenly enteredthe roommy dear fellow what have you been up to in moscow why have youquarreled with helene mon cher you are under a delusion said princevasili as he entered i know all about it and i can tell youpositively that helene is as innocent before you as christ was beforethe jewspierre was about to reply but prince vasili interrupted himand why didnt you simply come straight to me as to a friend i knowall about it and understand it all he said you behaved as becomes aman who values his honor perhaps too hastily but we wont go intothat but consider the position in which you are placing her and me inthe eyes of society and even of the court he added lowering hisvoice she is living in moscow and you are here remember dear boyand he drew pierres arm downwards it is simply a misunderstanding iexpect you feel it so yourself let us write her a letter at once andshell come here and all will be explained or else my dear boy let metell you its quite likely youll have to suffer for itprince vasili gave pierre a significant looki know from reliable sources that the dowager empress is taking a keeninterest in the whole affair you know she is very gracious to helenepierre tried several times to speak but on one hand prince vasili didnot let him and on the other pierre himself feared to begin to speakin the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he had firmlyresolved to answer his fatherinlaw moreover the words of the masonicstatutes be kindly and courteous recurred to him he blinked wentred got up and sat down again struggling with himself to do what wasfor him the most difficult thing in lifeto say an unpleasant thing toa mans face to say what the other whoever he might be did notexpect he was so used to submitting to prince vasilis tone of carelessselfassurance that he felt he would be unable to withstand it now buthe also felt that on what he said now his future dependedwhether hewould follow the same old road or that new path so attractively shownhim by the masons on which he firmly believed he would be reborn to anew lifenow dear boy said prince vasili playfully say yes and illwrite to her myself and we will kill the fatted calfbut before prince vasili had finished his playful speech pierrewithout looking at him and with a kind of fury that made him like hisfather muttered in a whisperprince i did not ask you here go please go and he jumped up andopened the door for himgo he repeated amazed at himself and glad to see the look ofconfusion and fear that showed itself on prince vasilis facewhats the matter with you are you illgo the quivering voice repeated and prince vasili had to go withoutreceiving any explanationa week later pierre having taken leave of his new friends the masonsand leaving large sums of money with them for alms went away to hisestates his new brethren gave him letters to the kiev and odessa masonsand promised to write to him and guide him in his new activitythe duel between pierre and dolokhov was hushed up and in spite of theemperors severity regarding duels at that time neither the principalsnor their seconds suffered for it but the story of the duel confirmedby pierres rupture with his wife was the talk of society pierre whohad been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was anillegitimate son and petted and extolled when he was the best match inrussia had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his marriagewhen the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing to hopefrom himespecially as he did not know how and did not wish to courtsocietys favor now he alone was blamed for what had happened he wassaid to be insanely jealous and subject like his father to fits ofbloodthirsty rage and when after pierres departure helene returned topetersburg she was received by all her acquaintances not onlycordially but even with a shade of deference due to her misfortunewhen conversation turned on her husband helene assumed a dignifiedexpression which with characteristic tact she had acquired though shedid not understand its significance this expression suggested that shehad resolved to endure her troubles uncomplainingly and that her husbandwas a cross laid upon her by god prince vasili expressed his opinionmore openly he shrugged his shoulders when pierre was mentioned andpointing to his forehead remarkeda bit touchedi always said soi said from the first declared anna pavlovna referring to pierre isaid at the time and before anyone else she insisted on her prioritythat that senseless young man was spoiled by the depraved ideas ofthese days i said so even at the time when everybody was in rapturesabout him when he had just returned from abroad and when if youremember he posed as a sort of marat at one of my soirees and how hasit ended i was against this marriage even then and foretold all thathas happenedanna pavlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind ofsoirees as beforesuch as she alone had the gift of arrangingat whichwas to be found the cream of really good society the bloom of theintellectual essence of petersburg as she herself put it besides thisrefined selection of society anna pavlovnas receptions were alsodistinguished by the fact that she always presented some new andinteresting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the stateof the political thermometer of legitimate petersburg court society sodearly and distinctly indicatedtoward the end of  when all the sad details of napoleonsdestruction of the prussian army at jena and auerstadt and the surrenderof most of the prussian fortresses had been received when our troopshad already entered prussia and our second war with napoleon wasbeginning anna pavlovna gave one of her soirees the cream of reallygood society consisted of the fascinating helene forsaken by herhusband mortemart the delightful prince hippolyte who had justreturned from vienna two diplomatists the old aunt a young manreferred to in that drawing room as a man of great merit un homme debeaucoup de merite a newly appointed maid of honor and her mother andseveral other less noteworthy personsthe novelty anna pavlovna was setting before her guests that evening wasboris drubetskoy who had just arrived as a special messenger from theprussian army and was aidedecamp to a very important personagethe temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company thatevening was thiswhatever the european sovereigns and commanders may do to countenancebonaparte and to cause me and us in general annoyance andmortification our opinion of bonaparte cannot alter we shall not ceaseto express our sincere views on that subject and can only say to theking of prussia and others so much the worse for you tu las voulugeorge dandin thats all we have to say about itwhen boris who was to be served up to the guests entered the drawingroom almost all the company had assembled and the conversation guidedby anna pavlovna was about our diplomatic relations with austria andthe hope of an alliance with herboris grown more manly and looking fresh rosy and selfpossessedentered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an aidedecamp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt and thenbrought back to the general circleanna pavlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him toseveral persons whom he did not know giving him a whispered descriptionof eachprince hippolyte kuragin m krug the charge daffaires fromcopenhagena profound intellect and simply mr shitova man ofgreat meritthis of the man usually so describedthanks to anna mikhaylovnas efforts his own tastes and thepeculiarities of his reserved nature boris had managed during hisservice to place himself very advantageously he was aidedecamp to avery important personage had been sent on a very important mission toprussia and had just returned from there as a special messenger he hadbecome thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he hadbeen so pleased at olmutz and according to which an ensign might rankincomparably higher than a general and according to which what wasneeded for success in the service was not effort or work or courage orperseverance but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who cangrant rewards and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of hissuccess and at the inability of others to understand these things inconsequence of this discovery his whole manner of life all hisrelations with old friends all his plans for his future werecompletely altered he was not rich but would spend his last groat tobe better dressed than others and would rather deprive himself of manypleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appearin the streets of petersburg in an old uniform he made friends with andsought the acquaintance of only those above him in position and whocould therefore be of use to him he liked petersburg and despisedmoscow the remembrance of the rostovs house and of his childish lovefor natasha was unpleasant to him and he had not once been to see therostovs since the day of his departure for the army to be in annapavlovnas drawing room he considered an important step up in theservice and he at once understood his role letting his hostess makeuse of whatever interest he had to offer he himself carefully scannedeach face appraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy witheach of those present and the advantages that might accrue he took theseat indicated to him beside the fair helene and listened to the generalconversationvienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable thatnot even a continuity of most brilliant successes would secure them andshe doubts the means we have of gaining them that is the actual phraseused by the vienna cabinet said the danish charge daffairesthe doubt is flattering said the man of profound intellect with asubtle smilewe must distinguish between the vienna cabinet and the emperor ofaustria said mortemart the emperor of austria can never have thoughtof such a thing it is only the cabinet that says itah my dear vicomte put in anna pavlovna lurope for some reasonshe called it urope as if that were a specially refined frenchpronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing with afrenchman lurope ne sera jamais notre alliee sincere  europe will never be our sincere allyafter that anna pavlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the kingof prussia in order to draw boris into the conversationboris listened attentively to each of the speakers awaiting his turnbut managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his neighbor thebeautiful helene whose eyes several times met those of the handsomeyoung aidedecamp with a smilespeaking of the position of prussia anna pavlovna very naturally askedboris to tell them about his journey to glogau and in what state hefound the prussian army boris speaking with deliberation told them inpure correct french many interesting details about the armies and thecourt carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of his own aboutthe facts he was recounting for some time he engrossed the generalattention and anna pavlovna felt that the novelty she had served up wasreceived with pleasure by all her visitors the greatest attention ofall to boris narrative was shown by helene she asked him severalquestions about his journey and seemed greatly interested in the stateof the prussian army as soon as he had finished she turned to him withher usual smileyou absolutely must come and see me she said in a tone that impliedthat for certain considerations he could not know of this wasabsolutely necessaryon tuesday between eight and nine it will give me great pleasureboris promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a conversationwith her when anna pavlovna called him away on the pretext that heraunt wished to hear himyou know her husband of course said anna pavlovna closing her eyesand indicating helene with a sorrowful gesture ah she is such anunfortunate and charming woman dont mention him before herpleasedont it is too painful for herwhen boris and anna pavlovna returned to the others prince hippolyte hadthe ear of the companybending forward in his armchair he said le roi de prusse and havingsaid this laughed everyone turned toward himle roi de prusse hippolyte said interrogatively again laughing andthen calmly and seriously sat back in his chair anna pavlovna waitedfor him to go on but as he seemed quite decided to say no more shebegan to tell of how at potsdam the impious bonaparte had stolen thesword of frederick the greatit is the sword of frederick the great which i she began buthippolyte interrupted her with the words le roi de prusse andagain as soon as all turned toward him excused himself and said nomoreanna pavlovna frowned mortemart hippolytes friend addressed himfirmlycome now what about your roi de prussehippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughingoh its nothing i only wished to say he wanted to repeat a jokehe had heard in vienna and which he had been trying all that evening toget in i only wished to say that we are wrong to fight pour le roi deprusseboris smiled circumspectly so that it might be taken as ironical orappreciative according to the way the joke was received everybodylaughedyour joke is too bad its witty but unjust said anna pavlovnashaking her little shriveled finger at himwe are not fighting pour le roi de prusse but for right principlesoh that wicked prince hippolyte she saidthe conversation did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on thepolitical news it became particularly animated toward the end of theevening when the rewards bestowed by the emperor were mentionedyou know n n received a snuffbox with the portrait last year saidthe man of profound intellect why shouldnt s s get the samedistinctionpardon me a snuffbox with the emperors portrait is a reward but not adistinction said the diplomatista gift ratherthere are precedents i may mention schwarzenbergits impossible replied anotherwill you bet the ribbon of the order is a different matterwhen everybody rose to go helene who had spoken very little all theevening again turned to boris asking him in a tone of caressingsignificant command to come to her on tuesdayit is of great importance to me she said turning with a smile towardanna pavlovna and anna pavlovna with the same sad smile with which shespoke of her exalted patroness supported helenes wishit seemed as if from some words boris had spoken that evening about theprussian army helene had suddenly found it necessary to see him sheseemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he came ontuesdaybut on tuesday evening having come to helenes splendid salon borisreceived no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him tocome there were other guests and the countess talked little to him andonly as he kissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedly and in awhisper with a strangely unsmiling face come to dinner tomorrow inthe evening you must come comeduring that stay in petersburg boris became an intimate in thecountess housethe war was flaming up and nearing the russian frontier everywhere oneheard curses on bonaparte the enemy of mankind militiamen andrecruits were being enrolled in the villages and from the seat of warcame contradictory news false as usual and therefore variouslyinterpreted the life of old prince bolkonski prince andrew andprincess mary had greatly changed since in  the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chiefthen appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout russiadespite the weakness of age which had become particularly noticeablesince the time when he thought his son had been killed he did not thinkit right to refuse a duty to which he had been appointed by the emperorhimself and this fresh opportunity for action gave him new energy andstrength he was continually traveling through the three provincesentrusted to him was pedantic in the fulfillment of his duties severeto cruel with his subordinates and went into everything down to theminutest details himself princess mary had ceased taking lessons inmathematics from her father and when the old prince was at home went tohis study with the wet nurse and little prince nicholas as hisgrandfather called him the baby prince nicholas lived with his wetnurse and nurse savishna in the late princess rooms and princess maryspent most of the day in the nursery taking a mothers place to herlittle nephew as best she could mademoiselle bourienne too seemedpassionately fond of the boy and princess mary often deprived herselfto give her friend the pleasure of dandling the little angelas shecalled her nephewand playing with himnear the altar of the church at bald hills there was a chapel over thetomb of the little princess and in this chapel was a marble monumentbrought from italy representing an angel with outspread wings ready tofly upwards the angels upper lip was slightly raised as though aboutto smile and once on coming out of the chapel prince andrew andprincess mary admitted to one another that the angels face remindedthem strangely of the little princess but what was still strangerthough of this prince andrew said nothing to his sister was that in theexpression the sculptor had happened to give the angels face princeandrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his deadwife ah why have you done this to mesoon after prince andrews return the old prince made over to him alarge estate bogucharovo about twentyfive miles from bald hillspartly because of the depressing memories associated with bald hillspartly because prince andrew did not always feel equal to bearing withhis fathers peculiarities and partly because he needed solitudeprince andrew made use of bogucharovo began building and spent most ofhis time thereafter the austerlitz campaign prince andrew had firmly resolved not tocontinue his military service and when the war recommenced andeverybody had to serve he took a post under his father in therecruitment so as to avoid active service the old prince and his sonseemed to have changed roles since the campaign of  the old manroused by activity expected the best results from the new campaignwhile prince andrew on the contrary taking no part in the war andsecretly regretting this saw only the dark sideon february

and after listening to the verbalinstructions his father had sent and taking the correspondence and hisfathers letter he returned to the nurserywell he askedstill the same wait for heavens sake karl

took the glass with the dropsand again went up to the cotandrew dont said princess marybut he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his eyesand stooped glass in hand over the infantbut i wish it he said i beg yougive it himprincess mary shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissively andcalling the nurse began giving the medicine the child screamedhoarsely prince andrew winced and clutching his head went out and satdown on a sofa in the next roomhe still had all the letters in his hand opening them mechanically hebegan reading the old prince now and then using abbreviations wrotein his large elongated hand on blue paper as followshave just this moment received by special messenger very joyful newsifits not false bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete victory overbuonaparte at eylau in petersburg everyone is rejoicing and therewards sent to the army are innumerable though he is a germanicongratulate him i cant make out what the commander at korchevoacertain khandrikovis up to till now the additional men and provisionshave not arrived gallop off to him at once and say ill have his headoff if everything is not here in a week have received another letterabout the preussischeylau battle from petenkahe took part in itandits all true when mischiefmakers dont meddle even a german beatsbuonaparte he is said to be fleeing in great disorder mind you gallopoff to korchevo without delay and carry out instructionsprince andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope it was aclosely written letter of two sheets from bilibin he folded it upwithout reading it and reread his fathers letter ending with thewords gallop off to korchevo and carry out instructionsno pardon me i wont go now till the child is better thought hegoing to the door and looking into the nurseryprincess mary was still standing by the cot gently rocking the babyah yes and what else did he say thats unpleasant thought princeandrew recalling his fathers letter yes we have gained a victoryover bonaparte just when im not serving yes yes hes always pokingfun at me ah well let him and he began reading bilibins letterwhich was written in french he read without understanding half of itread only to forget if but for a moment what he had too long beenthinking of so painfully to the exclusion of all elsebilibin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity andthough he wrote in french and used french jests and french idioms hedescribed the whole campaign with a fearless selfcensure and selfderision genuinely russian bilibin wrote that the obligation ofdiplomatic discretion tormented him and he was happy to have in princeandrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile hehad accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the army theletter was old having been written before the battle at preussischeylausince the day of our brilliant success at austerlitz wrote bilibinas you know my dear prince i never leave headquarters i havecertainly acquired a taste for war and it is just as well for me whati have seen during these last three months is incrediblei begin ab ovo the enemy of the human race as you know attacks theprussians the prussians are our faithful allies who have only betrayedus three times in three years we take up their cause but it turns outthat the enemy of the human race pays no heed to our fine speeches andin his rude and savage way throws himself on the prussians withoutgiving them time to finish the parade they had begun and in two twistsof the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs himself in thepalace at potsdami most ardently desire writes the king of prussia to bonapartethat your majesty should be received and treated in my palace in amanner agreeable to yourself and in so far as circumstances allowed ihave hastened to take all steps to that end may i have succeeded theprussian generals pride themselves on being polite to the french and laydown their arms at the first demandthe head of the garrison at glogau with ten thousand men asks theking of prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender allthis is absolutely truein short hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude itturns out that we have landed ourselves in war and what is more in waron our own frontiers with and for the king of prussia we haveeverything in perfect order only one little thing is lacking namely acommander in chief as it was considered that the austerlitz successmight have been more decisive had the commanderinchief not been soyoung all our octogenarians were reviewed and of prozorovski andkamenski the latter was preferred the general comes to us suvorovlike in a kibitka and is received with acclamations of joy andtriumphon the th the first courier arrives from petersburg the mails aretaken to the field marshals room for he likes to do everythinghimself i am called in to help sort the letters and take those meantfor us the field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed tohim we search but none are to be found the field marshal growsimpatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the emperor tocount t prince v and others then he bursts into one of his wildfuries and rages at everyone and everything seizes the letters opensthem and reads those from the emperor addressed to others ah sothats the way they treat me no confidence in me ah ordered to keepan eye on me very well then get along with you so he writes thefamous order of the day to general bennigseni am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the armyyou have brought your army corps to pultusk routed here it is exposedand without fuel or forage so something must be done and as youyourself reported to count buxhowden yesterday you must think ofretreating to our frontierwhich do todayfrom all my riding he writes to the emperor i have got a saddlesore which coming after all my previous journeys quite prevents myriding and commanding so vast an army so i have passed on the commandto the general next in seniority count buxhowden having sent him mywhole staff and all that belongs to it advising him if there is a lackof bread to move farther into the interior of prussia for only onedays ration of bread remains and in some regiments none at all asreported by the division commanders ostermann and sedmoretzki and allthat the peasants had has been eaten up i myself will remain inhospital at ostrolenka till i recover in regard to which i humblysubmit my report with the information that if the army remains in itspresent bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy man leftin it by springgrant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is alreadyin any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and glorioustask for which he was chosen i shall await your most graciouspermission here in hospital that i may not have to play the part of asecretary rather than commander in the army my removal from the armydoes not produce the slightest stira blind man has left it there arethousands such as i in russiathe field marshal is angry with the emperor and he punishes us allisnt it logicalthis is the first act those that follow are naturally increasinglyinteresting and entertaining after the field marshals departure itappears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battlebuxhowden is commanderinchief by seniority but general bennigsen doesnot quite see it more particularly as it is he and his corps who arewithin sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity tofight a battle on his own hand as the germans say he does so this isthe battle of pultusk which is considered a great victory but in myopinion was nothing of the kind we civilians as you know have a verybad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost those who retreatafter a battle have lost it is what we say and according to that it iswe who lost the battle of pultusk in short we retreat after the battlebut send a courier to petersburg with news of a victory and generalbennigsen hoping to receive from petersburg the post of commander inchief as a reward for his victory does not give up the command of thearmy to general buxhowden during this interregnum we begin a veryoriginal and interesting series of maneuvers our aim is no longer asit should be to avoid or attack the enemy but solely to avoid generalbuxhowden who by right of seniority should be our chief soenergetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordableriver we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy who atthe moment is not bonaparte but buxhowden general buxhowden was all butattacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one ofthese maneuvers that enabled us to escape him buxhowden pursues uswescuttle he hardly crosses the river to our side before we recross tothe other at last our enemy buxhowden catches us and attacks bothgenerals are angry and the result is a challenge on buxhowdens partand an epileptic fit on bennigsens but at the critical moment thecourier who carried the news of our victory at pultusk to petersburgreturns bringing our appointment as commanderinchief and our firstfoe buxhowden is vanquished we can now turn our thoughts to thesecond bonaparte but as it turns out just at that moment a thirdenemy rises before usnamely the orthodox russian soldiers loudlydemanding bread meat biscuits fodder and whatnot the stores areempty the roads impassable the orthodox begin looting and in a way ofwhich our last campaign can give you no idea half the regiments formbands and scour the countryside and put everything to fire and swordthe inhabitants are totally ruined the hospitals overflow with sickand famine is everywhere twice the marauders even attack ourheadquarters and the commanderinchief has to ask for a battalion todisperse them during one of these attacks they carried off my emptyportmanteau and my dressing gown the emperor proposes to give allcommanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders but i much fearthis will oblige one half the army to shoot the otherat first prince andrew read with his eyes only but after a while inspite of himself although he knew how far it was safe to trustbilibin what he had read began to interest him more and more when hehad read thus far he crumpled the letter up and threw it away it wasnot what he had read that vexed him but the fact that the life outthere in which he had now no part could perturb him he shut his eyesrubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he hadread and listened to what was passing in the nursery suddenly hethought he heard a strange noise through the door he was seized withalarm lest something should have happened to the child while he wasreading the letter he went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened itjust as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from himwith a scared look and that princess mary was no longer by the cotmy dear he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behindhimas often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety he wasseized by an unreasoning panicit occurred to him that the child wasdead all that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terrorall is over he thought and a cold sweat broke out on his foreheadhe went to the cot in confusion sure that he would find it empty andthat the nurse had been hiding the dead baby he drew the curtain asideand for some time his frightened restless eyes could not find the babyat last he saw him the rosy boy had tossed about till he lay across thebed with his head lower than the pillow and was smacking his lips inhis sleep and breathing evenlyprince andrew was as glad to find the boy like that as if he hadalready lost him he bent over him and as his sister had taught himtried with his lips whether the child was still feverish the softforehead was moist prince andrew touched the head with his hand eventhe hair was wet so profusely had the child perspired he was not deadbut evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent prince andrewlonged to snatch up to squeeze to hold to his heart this helplesslittle creature but dared not do so he stood over him gazing at hishead and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket heheard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of thecot he did not look round but still gazing at the infants facelistened to his regular breathing the dark shadow was princess marywho had come up to the cot with noiseless steps lifted the curtain anddropped it again behind her prince andrew recognized her withoutlooking and held out his hand to her she pressed ithe has perspired said prince andrewi was coming to tell you sothe child moved slightly in his sleep smiled and rubbed his foreheadagainst the pillowprince andrew looked at his sister in the dim shadow of the curtain herluminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy thatwere in them she leaned over to her brother and kissed him slightlycatching the curtain of the cot each made the other a warning gestureand stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishingto leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all theworld prince andrew was the first to move away ruffling his hairagainst the muslin of the curtainyes this is the one thing left me now he said with a sighsoon after his admission to the masonic brotherhood pierre went to thekiev province where he had the greatest number of serfs taking withhim full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as towhat he should do on his estateswhen he reached kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office andexplained to them his intentions and wishes he told them that stepswould be taken immediately to free his serfsand that till then theywere not to be overburdened with labor women while nursing their babieswere not to be sent to work assistance was to be given to the serfspunishments were to be admonitory and not corporal and hospitalsasylums and schools were to be established on all the estates some ofthe stewards there were semiliterate foremen among them listened withalarm supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeasedwith their management and embezzlement of money some after their firstfright were amused by pierres lisp and the new words they had not heardbefore others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked while thecleverest among them including the chief steward understood from thisspeech how they could best handle the master for their own endsthe chief steward expressed great sympathy with pierres intentions butremarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into thegeneral state of affairs which was far from satisfactorydespite count bezukhovs enormous wealth since he had come into anincome which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a yearpierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him anallowance of ten thousand rubles he had a dim perception of thefollowing budgetabout  went in payments on all the estates to the land bank about went for the upkeep of the estate near moscow the town houseand the allowance to the three princesses about  was given inpensions and the same amount for asylums  alimony was sent tothe countess about  went for interest on debts the building of anew church previously begun had cost about  in each of the lasttwo years and he did not know how the rest about  rubles wasspent and almost every year he was obliged to borrow besides this thechief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests orof the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops so the firsttask pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude orinclinationpractical businesshe discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward but hefelt that this did not forward matters at all he felt that theseconsultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up withthem or make them move on the one hand the chief steward put the stateof things to him in the very worst light pointing out the necessity ofpaying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf labor towhich pierre did not agree on the other hand pierre demanded thatsteps should be taken to liberate the serfs which the steward met byshowing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the land bankand the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipationthe steward did not say it was quite impossible but suggested sellingthe forests in the province of kostroma the land lower down the riverand the crimean estate in order to make it possible all of whichoperations according to him were connected with such complicatedmeasuresthe removal of injunctions petitions permits and so onthat pierre became quite bewildered and only repliedyes yes do sopierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled himto attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only triedto pretend to the steward that he was attending to it the steward forhis part tried to pretend to the count that he considered theseconsultations very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome tohimselfin kiev pierre found some people he knew and strangers hastened to makehis acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer the largestlandowner of the province temptations to pierres greatest weaknessthe one to which he had confessed when admitted to the lodgewere sostrong that he could not resist them again whole days weeks andmonths of his life passed in as great a rush and were as much occupiedwith evening parties dinners lunches and balls giving him no timefor reflection as in petersburg instead of the new life he had hopedto lead he still lived the old life only in new surroundingsof the three precepts of freemasonry pierre realized that he did notfulfill the one which enjoined every mason to set an example of morallife and that of the seven virtues he lacked twomorality and the loveof death he consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled anotherof the preceptsthat of reforming the human raceand had othervirtueslove of his neighbor and especially generosityin the spring of  he decided to return to petersburg on the way heintended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his ordershad been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom god hadentrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefitthe chief steward who considered the young counts attempts almostinsaneunprofitable to himself to the count and to the serfsmadesome concessions continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs asimpracticable he arranged for the erection of large buildingsschoolshospitals and asylumson all the estates before the master arrivedeverywhere preparations were made not for ceremonious welcomes which heknew pierre would not like but for just such gratefully religiousones with offerings of icons and the bread and salt of hospitality asaccording to his understanding of his master would touch and deludehimthe southern spring the comfortable rapid traveling in a viennacarriage and the solitude of the road all had a gladdening effect onpierre the estates he had not before visited were each more picturesquethan the other the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchinglygrateful for the benefits conferred on them everywhere were receptionswhich though they embarrassed pierre awakened a joyful feeling in thedepth of his heart in one place the peasants presented him with breadand salt and an icon of saint peter and saint paul asking permissionas a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on themto build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor ofpeter and paul his patron saints in another place the women withinfants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard workon a third estate the priest bearing a cross came to meet himsurrounded by children whom by the counts generosity he wasinstructing in reading writing and religion on all his estates pierresaw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erectionall on one plan for hospitals schools and almshouses which were soonto be opened everywhere he saw the stewards accounts according towhich the serfs manorial labor had been diminished and heard thetouching thanks of deputations of serfs in their fullskirted bluecoatswhat pierre did not know was that the place where they presented himwith bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of peter andpaul was a market village where a fair was held on st peters day andthat the richest peasants who formed the deputation had begun thechantry long before but that nine tenths of the peasants in thatvillages were in a state of the greatest poverty he did not know thatsince the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land theydid still harder work on their own land he did not know that the priestwho met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions andthat the pupils parents wept at having to let him take their childrenand secured their release by heavy payments he did not know that thebrick buildings built to plan were being built by serfs whose manoriallabor was thus increased though lessened on paper he did not know thatwhere the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs paymentshad been diminished by a third their obligatory manorial work had beenincreased by a half and so pierre was delighted with his visit to hisestates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had leftpetersburg and wrote enthusiastic letters to his brotherinstructoras he called the grand masterhow easy it is how little effort it needs to do so much goodthought pierre and how little attention we pay to ithe was pleased at the gratitude he received but felt abashed atreceiving it this gratitude reminded him of how much more he might dofor these simple kindly peoplethe chief steward a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectlythrough the naive and intelligent count and played with him as with atoy seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on pierrepressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above allthe uselessness of freeing the serfs who were quite happy as it waspierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would bedifficult to imagine happier people and that god only knew what wouldhappen to them when they were free but he insisted though reluctantlyon what he thought right the steward promised to do all in his power tocarry out the counts wishes seeing clearly that not only would thecount never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken forthe sale of the land and forests and to release them from the land bankbut would probably never even inquire and would never know that thenewly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continuedto give in money and work all that other peoples serfs gavethat is tosay all that could be got out of themreturning from his journey through south russia in the happiest state ofmind pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting hisfriend bolkonski whom he had not seen for two yearsbogucharovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among fieldsand forests of fir and birch which were partly cut down the house laybehind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and with banksstill bare of grass it was at the end of a village that stretched alongthe highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were a few firtreesthe homestead consisted of a threshing floor outhouses stables abathhouse a lodge and a large brick house with semicircular facadestill in course of construction round the house was a garden newly laidout the fences and gates were new and solid two fire pumps and a watercart painted green stood in a shed the paths were straight thebridges were strong and had handrails everything bore an impress oftidiness and good management some domestic serfs pierre met in replyto inquiries as to where the prince lived pointed out a small newlybuilt lodge close to the pond anton a man who had looked after princeandrew in his boyhood helped pierre out of his carriage said that theprince was at home and showed him into a clean little anteroompierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house afterthe brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend inpetersburghe quickly entered the small reception room with its stillunplasteredwooden walls redolent of pine and would have gone farther but antonran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a doorwell what is it came a sharp unpleasant voicea visitor answered antonask him to wait and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed backpierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to facewith prince andrew who came out frowning and looking old pierreembraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheekand looked at him closelywell i did not expect you i am very glad said prince andrewpierre said nothing he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise hewas struck by the change in him his words were kindly and there was asmile on his lips and face but his eyes were dull and lifeless and inspite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous andglad sparkle prince andrew had grown thinner paler and more manlylooking but what amazed and estranged pierre till he got used to itwere his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolongedconcentration on some one thoughtas is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separationit was long before their conversation could settle on anything they putquestions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to betalked over at length at last the conversation gradually settled onsome of the topics at first lightly touched on their past life plansfor the future pierres journeys and occupations the war and so onthe preoccupation and despondency which pierre had noticed in hisfriends look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile withwhich he listened to pierre especially when he spoke with joyfulanimation of the past or the future it was as if prince andrew wouldhave liked to sympathize with what pierre was saying but could not thelatter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of hisenthusiasms dreams and hopes of happiness or goodness in princeandrews presence he was ashamed to express his new masonic viewswhich had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tourhe checked himself fearing to seem naive yet he felt an irresistibledesire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quitedifferent and better pierre than he had been in petersburgi cant tell you how much i have lived through since then i hardlyknow myself againyes we have altered much very much since then said prince andrewwell and you what are your plansplans repeated prince andrew ironically my plans he said as ifastonished at the word well you see im building i mean to settlehere altogether next yearpierre looked silently and searchingly into prince andrews face whichhad grown much olderno i meant to ask pierre began but prince andrew interrupted himbut why talk of me talk to me yes tell me about your travels andall you have been doing on your estatespierre began describing what he had done on his estates trying as faras possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had beenmade prince andrew several times prompted pierres story of what he hadbeen doing as though it were all an oldtime story and he listened notonly without interest but even as if ashamed of what pierre was tellinghimpierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friends company andat last became silentill tell you what my dear fellow said prince andrew who evidentlyalso felt depressed and constrained with his visitor i am onlybivouacking here and have just come to look round i am going back to mysister today i will introduce you to her but of course you know heralready he said evidently trying to entertain a visitor with whom henow found nothing in common we will go after dinner and would you nowlike to look round my placethey went out and walked about till dinnertime talking of the politicalnews and common acquaintances like people who do not know each otherintimately prince andrew spoke with some animation and interest only ofthe new homestead he was constructing and its buildings but even herewhile on the scaffolding in the midst of a talk explaining the futurearrangements of the house he interrupted himselfhowever this is not at all interesting let us have dinner and thenwell set offat dinner conversation turned on pierres marriagei was very much surprised when i heard of it said prince andrewpierre blushed as he always did when it was mentioned and saidhurriedly i will tell you some time how it all happened but you knowit is all over and foreverforever said prince andrew nothings foreverbut you know how it all ended dont you you heard of the dueland so you had to go through that tooone thing i thank god for is that i did not kill that man saidpierrewhy so asked prince andrew to kill a vicious dog is a very goodthing reallyno to kill a man is badwrongwhy is it wrong urged prince andrew it is not given to man to knowwhat is right and what is wrong men always did and always will err andin nothing more than in what they consider right and wrongwhat does harm to another is wrong said pierre feeling with pleasurethat for the first time since his arrival prince andrew was roused hadbegun to talk and wanted to express what had brought him to his presentstateand who has told you what is bad for another man he askedbad bad exclaimed pierre we all know what is bad for ourselvesyes we know that but the harm i am conscious of in myself issomething i cannot inflict on others said prince andrew growing moreand more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook topierre he spoke in french i only know two very real evils in liferemorse and illness the only good is the absence of those evils tolive for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy nowand love of ones neighbor and selfsacrifice began pierre no icant agree with you to live only so as not to do evil and not to haveto repent is not enough i lived like that i lived for myself andruined my life and only now when i am living or at least tryingpierres modesty made him correct himself to live for others onlynow have i understood all the happiness of life no i shall not agreewith you and you do not really believe what you are saying princeandrew looked silently at pierre with an ironic smilewhen you see my sister princess mary youll get on with her hesaid perhaps you are right for yourself he added after a shortpause but everyone lives in his own way you lived for yourself andsay you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness when you beganliving for others i experienced just the reverse i lived for gloryand after all what is glory the same love of others a desire to dosomething for them a desire for their approvalso i lived for othersand not almost but quite ruined my life and i have become calmersince i began to live only for myselfbut what do you mean by living only for yourself asked pierregrowing excited what about your son your sister and your fatherbut thats just the same as myselfthey are not others explainedprince andrew the others ones neighbors le prochain as you andprincess mary call it are the chief source of all error and evil leprochainyour kiev peasants to whom you want to do goodand he looked at pierre with a mocking challenging expression heevidently wished to draw him onyou are joking replied pierre growing more and more excited whaterror or evil can there be in my wishing to do good and even doing alittlethough i did very little and did it very badly what evil canthere be in it if unfortunate people our serfs people like ourselveswere growing up and dying with no idea of god and truth beyondceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in acomforting belief in future life retribution recompense andconsolation what evil and error are there in it if people were dyingof disease without help while material assistance could so easily berendered and i supplied them with a doctor a hospital and an asylumfor the aged and is it not a palpable unquestionable good if apeasant or a woman with a baby has no rest day or night and i givethem rest and leisure said pierre hurrying and lisping and i havedone that though badly and to a small extent but i have done somethingtoward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good action andmore than that you cant make me believe that you do not think soyourself and the main thing is he continued that i know and knowfor certain that the enjoyment of doing this good is the only surehappiness in lifeyes if you put it like that its quite a different matter saidprince andrew i build a house and lay out a garden and you buildhospitals the one and the other may serve as a pastime but whatsright and whats good must be judged by one who knows all but not byus well you want an argument he added come on thenthey rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which servedas a verandacome lets argue then said prince andrew you talk of schools hewent on crooking a finger education and so forth that is you wantto raise him pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking off hiscap from his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs whileit seems to me that animal happiness is the only happiness possible andthat is just what you want to deprive him of i envy him but you wantto make him what i am without giving him my means then you saylighten his toil but as i see it physical labor is as essential tohim as much a condition of his existence as mental activity is to youor me you cant help thinking i go to bed after two in the morningthoughts come and i cant sleep but toss about till dawn because ithink and cant help thinking just as he cant help plowing and mowingif he didnt he would go to the drink shop or fall ill just as i couldnot stand his terrible physical labor but should die of it in a week sohe could not stand my physical idleness but would grow fat and die thethird thingwhat else was it you talked about and prince andrewcrooked a third finger ah yes hospitals medicine he has a fit heis dying and you come and bleed him and patch him up he will dragabout as a cripple a burden to everybody for another ten years itwould be far easier and simpler for him to die others are being bornand there are plenty of them as it is it would be different if yougrudged losing a laborerthats how i regard himbut you want to curehim from love of him and he does not want that and besides what anotion that medicine ever cured anyone killed them yes said hefrowning angrily and turning away from pierreprince andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it wasevident he had reflected on this subject more than once and he spokereadily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time hisglance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopelessoh that is dreadful dreadful said pierre i dont understand howone can live with such ideas i had such moments myself not long ago inmoscow and when traveling but at such times i collapsed so that i dontlive at alleverything seems hateful to me myself most of all theni dont eat dont wash and how is it with youwhy not wash that is not cleanly said prince andrew on thecontrary one must try to make ones life as pleasant as possible imalive that is not my fault so i must live out my life as best i canwithout hurting othersbut with such ideas what motive have you for living one would sitwithout moving undertaking nothinglife as it is leaves one no peace i should be thankful to do nothingbut here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the honor tochoose me to be their marshal it was all i could do to get out of itthey could not understand that i have not the necessary qualificationsfor itthe kind of goodnatured fussy shallowness necessary for theposition then theres this house which must be built in order to havea nook of ones own in which to be quiet and now theres thisrecruitingwhy arent you serving in the armyafter austerlitz said prince andrew gloomily no thank you verymuch i have promised myself not to serve again in the active russianarmy and i wontnot even if bonaparte were here at smolenskthreatening bald hillseven then i wouldnt serve in the russian armywell as i was saying he continued recovering his composure nowtheres this recruiting my father is chief in command of the thirddistrict and my only way of avoiding active service is to serve underhimthen you are servingi amhe paused a little whileand why do you servewhy for this reason my father is one of the most remarkable men ofhis time but he is growing old and though not exactly cruel he has tooenergetic a character he is so accustomed to unlimited power that he isterrible and now he has this authority of a commanderinchief of therecruiting granted by the emperor if i had been two hours late afortnight ago he would have had a paymasters clerk at yukhnovnahanged said prince andrew with a smile so i am serving because ialone have any influence with my father and now and then can save himfrom actions which would torment him afterwardswell there you seeyes but it is not as you imagine prince andrew continued i didnot and do not in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk whohad stolen some boots from the recruits i should even have been veryglad to see him hanged but i was sorry for my fatherthat again is formyselfprince andrew grew more and more animated his eyes glittered feverishlywhile he tried to prove to pierre that in his actions there was nodesire to do good to his neighborthere now you wish to liberate your serfs he continued that is avery good thing but not for youi dont suppose you ever had anyoneflogged or sent to siberiaand still less for your serfs if they arebeaten flogged or sent to siberia i dont suppose they are any theworse off in siberia they lead the same animal life and the stripes ontheir bodies heal and they are happy as before but it is a good thingfor proprietors who perish morally bring remorse upon themselvesstifle this remorse and grow callous as a result of being able toinflict punishments justly and unjustly it is those people i pity andfor their sake i should like to liberate the serfs you may not haveseen but i have seen how good men brought up in those traditions ofunlimited power in time when they grow more irritable become cruel andharsh are conscious of it but cannot restrain themselves and grow moreand more miserableprince andrew spoke so earnestly that pierre could not help thinkingthat these thoughts had been suggested to prince andrew by his fatherscasehe did not replyso thats what im sorry forhuman dignity peace of mind purity andnot the serfs backs and foreheads which beat and shave as you mayalways remain the same backs and foreheadsno no a thousand times no i shall never agree with you saidpierrein the evening andrew and pierre got into the open carriage and drove tobald hills prince andrew glancing at pierre broke the silence now andthen with remarks which showed that he was in a good temperpointing to the fields he spoke of the improvements he was making inhis husbandrypierre remained gloomily silent answering in monosyllables andapparently immersed in his own thoughtshe was thinking that prince andrew was unhappy had gone astray did notsee the true light and that he pierre ought to aid enlighten andraise him but as soon as he thought of what he should say he felt thatprince andrew with one word one argument would upset all his teachingand he shrank from beginning afraid of exposing to possible ridiculewhat to him was precious and sacredno but why do you think so pierre suddenly began lowering his headand looking like a bull about to charge why do you think so youshould not think sothink what about asked prince andrew with surpriseabout life about mans destiny it cant be so i myself thought likethat and do you know what saved me freemasonry no dont smilefreemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect as i thought it wasfreemasonry is the best expression of the best the eternal aspects ofhumanityand he began to explain freemasonry as he understood it to princeandrew he said that freemasonry is the teaching of christianity freedfrom the bonds of state and church a teaching of equality brotherhoodand loveonly our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life all the rest isa dream said pierre understand my dear fellow that outside thisunion all is filled with deceit and falsehood and i agree with you thatnothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out hislife like you merely trying not to harm others but make ourfundamental convictions your own join our brotherhood give yourself upto us let yourself be guided and you will at once feel yourself as ihave felt myself a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning ofwhich is hidden in heaven said pierreprince andrew looking straight in front of him listened in silence topierres words more than once when the noise of the wheels preventedhis catching what pierre said he asked him to repeat it and by thepeculiar glow that came into prince andrews eyes and by his silencepierre saw that his words were not in vain and that prince andrew wouldnot interrupt him or laugh at what he saidthey reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had tocross by ferry while the carriage and horses were being placed on itthey also stepped on the raftprince andrew leaning his arms on the raft railing gazed silently atthe flooding waters glittering in the setting sunwell what do you think about it pierre asked why are you silentwhat do i think about it i am listening to you its all very wellyou say join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of life thedestiny of man and the laws which govern the world but who are wemen how is it you know everything why do i alone not see what you seeyou see a reign of goodness and truth on earth but i dont see itpierre interrupted himdo you believe in a future life he askeda future life prince andrew repeated but pierre giving him no timeto reply took the repetition for a denial the more readily as he knewprince andrews former atheistic convictionsyou say you cant see a reign of goodness and truth on earth nor couldi and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the end ofeverything on earth here on this earth pierre pointed to thefields there is no truth all is false and evil but in the universein the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth and we who are nowthe children of earth areeternallychildren of the whole universedont i feel in my soul that i am part of this vast harmonious wholedont i feel that i form one link one step between the lower andhigher beings in this vast harmonious multitude of beings in whom thedeitythe supreme power if you prefer the termis manifest if i seeclearly see that ladder leading from plant to man why should i supposeit breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther i feel that icannot vanish since nothing vanishes in this world but that i shallalways exist and always have existed i feel that beyond me and above methere are spirits and that in this world there is truthyes that is herders theory said prince andrew but it is not thatwhich can convince me dear friendlife and death are what convincewhat convinces is when one sees a being dear to one bound up with onesown life before whom one was to blame and had hoped to make it rightprince andrews voice trembled and he turned away and suddenly thatbeing is seized with pain suffers and ceases to exist why itcannot be that there is no answer and i believe there is thatswhat convinces that is what has convinced me said prince andrewyes yes of course said pierre isnt that what im sayingno all i say is that it is not argument that convinces me of thenecessity of a future life but this when you go hand in hand withsomeone and all at once that person vanishes there into nowhere andyou yourself are left facing that abyss and look in and i have lookedinwell thats it then you know that there is a there and there is asomeone there is the future life the someone isgodprince andrew did not reply the carriage and horses had long since beentaken off onto the farther bank and reharnessed the sun had sunk halfbelow the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near theferry but pierre and andrew to the astonishment of the footmencoachmen and ferrymen still stood on the raft and talkedif there is a god and future life there is truth and good and manshighest happiness consists in striving to attain them we must live wemust love and we must believe that we live not only today on this scrapof earth but have lived and shall live forever there in the wholesaid pierre and he pointed to the skyprince andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening topierre and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of thesun gleaming on the blue waters there was perfect stillness pierrebecame silent the raft had long since stopped and only the waves of thecurrent beat softly against it below prince andrew felt as if the soundof the waves kept up a refrain to pierres words whisperingit is true believe ithe sighed and glanced with a radiant childlike tender look atpierres face flushed and rapturous but yet shy before his superiorfriendyes if it only were so said prince andrew however it is time toget on he added and stepping off the raft he looked up at the skyto which pierre had pointed and for the first time since austerlitz sawthat high everlasting sky he had seen while lying on that battlefieldand something that had long been slumbering something that was bestwithin him suddenly awoke joyful and youthful in his soul itvanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions of his lifebut he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to developexisted within him his meeting with pierre formed an epoch in princeandrews life though outwardly he continued to live in the same oldway inwardly he began a new lifeit was getting dusk when prince andrew and pierre drove up to the frontentrance of the house at bald hills as they approached the houseprince andrew with a smile drew pierres attention to a commotion goingon at the back porch a woman bent with age with a wallet on her backand a short longhaired young man in a black garment had rushed backto the gate on seeing the carriage driving up two women ran out afterthem and all four looking round at the carriage ran in dismay up thesteps of the back porchthose are marys gods folk said prince andrew they have mistakenus for my father this is the one matter in which she disobeys him heorders these pilgrims to be driven away but she receives thembut what are gods folk asked pierreprince andrew had no time to answer the servants came out to meet themand he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected backsoonthe old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minuteprince andrew led pierre to his own apartments which were always keptin perfect order and readiness for him in his fathers house he himselfwent to the nurserylet us go and see my sister he said to pierre when he returned ihave not found her yet she is hiding now sitting with her godsfolk it will serve her right she will be confused but you will seeher gods folk its really very curiouswhat are gods folk asked pierrecome and youll see for yourselfprincess mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her facewhen they went in in her snug room with lamps burning before the iconstand a young lad with a long nose and long hair wearing a monkscassock sat on the sofa beside her behind a

herpelageya stopped doubtfully but in pierres face there was such a lookof sincere penitence and prince andrew glanced so meekly now at her andnow at pierre that she was gradually reassuredthe pilgrim woman was appeased and being encouraged to talk gave along account of father amphilochus who led so holy a life that hishands smelled of incense and how on her last visit to kiev some monksshe knew let her have the keys of the catacombs and how she takingsome dried bread with her had spent two days in the catacombs with thesaints id pray awhile to one ponder awhile then go on to anotherid sleep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics and there wassuch peace all around such blessedness that one dont want to comeout even into the light of heaven againpierre listened to her attentively and seriously prince andrew went outof the room and then leaving gods folk to finish their teaprincess mary took pierre into the drawing roomyou are very kind she said to himoh i really did not mean to hurt her feelings i understand them sowell and have the greatest respect for themprincess mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionatelyi have known you a long time you see and am as fond of

spring hiswound reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away for a cure and iam also very much afraid for him spiritually he has not a characterlike us women who when we suffer can weep away our sorrows he keepsit all within him today he is cheerful and in good spirits but that isthe effect of your visithe is not often like that if you couldpersuade him to go abroad he needs activity and this quiet regularlife is very bad for him others dont notice it but i see ittoward ten oclock the men servants rushed to the front door hearingthe bells of the old princes carriage approaching prince andrew andpierre also went out into the porchwhos that asked the old prince noticing pierre as he got out of thecarriageah very glad kiss me he said having learned who the young strangerwasthe old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to pierrebefore supper prince andrew coming back to his fathers study foundhim disputing hotly with his visitor pierre was maintaining that a timewould come when there would be no more wars the old prince disputed itchaffingly but without getting angrydrain the blood from mens veins and put in water instead then therewill be no more war old womens nonsenseold womens nonsense herepeated but still he patted pierre affectionately on the shoulder andthen went up to the table where prince andrew evidently not wishing tojoin in the conversation was looking over the papers his father hadbrought from town the old prince went up to him and began to talkbusinessthe marshal a count rostov hasnt sent half his contingent he cameto town and wanted to invite me to dinneri gave him a prettydinner and there look at this well my boy the old princewent on addressing his son and patting pierre on the shoulder a finefellowyour friendi like him he stirs me up another says cleverthings and one doesnt care to listen but this one talks rubbish yetstirs an old fellow up well go get along perhaps ill come and sitwith you at supper well have another dispute make friends with mylittle fool princess mary he shouted after pierre through the dooronly now on his visit to bald hills did pierre fully realize thestrength and charm of his friendship with prince andrew that charm wasnot expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his familyand with the household with the stern old prince and the gentle timidprincess mary though he had scarcely known them pierre at once feltlike an old friend they were all fond of him already not only princessmary who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims gave him hermost radiant looks but even the oneyearold prince nicholas as hisgrandfather called him smiled at pierre and let himself be taken in hisarms and michael ivanovich and mademoiselle bourienne looked at himwith pleasant smiles when he talked to the old princethe old prince came in to supper this was evidently on pierresaccount and during the two days of the young mans visit he wasextremely kind to him and told him to visit them againwhen pierre had gone and the members of the household met together theybegan to express their opinions of him as people always do after a newacquaintance has left but as seldom happens no one said anything butwhat was good of himwhen returning from his leave rostov felt for the first time howclose was the bond that united him to denisov and the whole regimenton approaching it rostov felt as he had done when approaching his homein moscow when he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform ofhis regiment when he recognized redhaired dementyev and saw the picketropes of the roan horses when lavrushka gleefully shouted to hismaster the count has come and denisov who had been asleep on hisbed ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him and theofficers collected round to greet the new arrival rostov experiencedthe same feeling as when his mother his father and his sister hadembraced him and tears of joy choked him so that he could not speakthe regiment was also a home and as unalterably dear and precious ashis parents housewhen he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and hadbeen reassigned to his former squadron had been on duty and had goneout foraging when he had again entered into all the little interests ofthe regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in onenarrow unchanging frame he experienced the same sense of peace ofmoral support and the same sense of being at home here in his ownplace as he had felt under the parental roof but here was none of allthat turmoil of the world at large where he did not know his rightplace and took mistaken decisions here was no sonya with whom he oughtor ought not to have an explanation here was no possibility of goingthere or not going there here there were not twentyfour hours in theday which could be spent in such a variety of ways there was not thatinnumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him or fartherfrom him than another there were none of those uncertain and undefinedmoney relations with his father and nothing to recall that terribleloss to dolokhov here in the regiment all was clear and simple thewhole world was divided into two unequal parts one our pavlogradregiment the other all the rest and the rest was no concern of hisin the regiment everything was definite who was lieutenant whocaptain who was a good fellow who a bad one and most of all who wasa comrade the canteenkeeper gave one credit ones pay came every fourmonths there was nothing to think out or decide you had only to donothing that was considered bad in the pavlograd regiment and whengiven an order to do what was clearly distinctly and definitelyorderedand all would be wellhaving once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimentallife rostov felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down torest life in the regiment during this campaign was all the pleasanterfor him because after his loss to dolokhov for which in spite of allhis familys efforts to console him he could not forgive himself hehad made up his mind to atone for his fault by serving not as he haddone before but really well and by being a perfectly firstratecomrade and officerin a word a splendid man altogether a thing whichseemed so difficult out in the world but so possible in the regimentafter his losses he had determined to pay back his debt to his parentsin five years he received ten thousand rubles a year but now resolvedto take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to hisparentsour army after repeated retreats and advances and battles at pultuskand preussischeylau was concentrated near bartenstein it was awaitingthe emperors arrival and the beginning of a new campaignthe pavlograd regiment belonging to that part of the army which hadserved in the  campaign had been recruiting up to strength inrussia and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of thecampaign it had been neither at pultusk nor at preussischeylau andwhen it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaignwas attached to platovs divisionplatovs division was acting independently of the main army severaltimes parts of the pavlograd regiment had exchanged shots with theenemy had taken prisoners and once had even captured marshal oudinotscarriages in april the pavlograds were stationed immovably for someweeks near a totally ruined and deserted german villagea thaw had set in it was muddy and cold the ice on the river brokeand the roads became impassable for days neither provisions for the mennor fodder for the horses had been issued as no transports couldarrive the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villagessearching for potatoes but found few even of theseeverything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fledif anyremained they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be takenfrom them even the soldiers usually pitiless enough instead of takinganything from them often gave them the last of their rationsthe pavlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action but hadlost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness in the hospitalsdeath was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever or the swellingthat came from bad food preferred to remain on duty and hardly able todrag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals whenspring came on the soldiers found a plant just showing out of theground that looked like asparagus which for some reason they calledmashkas sweet root it was very bitter but they wandered about thefields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate it thoughthey were ordered not to do so as it was a noxious plant that spring anew disease broke out among the soldiers a swelling of the arms legsand face which the doctors attributed to eating this root but in spiteof all this the soldiers of denisovs squadron fed chiefly on mashkassweet root because it was the second week that the last of thebiscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man and thelast potatoes received had sprouted and frozenthe horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatchedroofs and had become terribly thin though still covered with tufts offelty winter hairdespite this destitution the soldiers and officers went on living justas usual despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms thehussars formed line for roll call kept things in order groomed theirhorses polished their arms brought in straw from the thatched roofs inplace of fodder and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which theyrose up hungry joking about their nasty food and their hunger asusual in their spare time they lit bonfires steamed themselves beforethem naked smoked picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes toldand listened to stories of potemkins and suvorovs campaigns or tolegends of alesha the sly or the priests laborer mikolkathe officers as usual lived in twos and threes in the roofless halfruined houses the seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and ingeneral food for the men the younger ones occupied themselves asbefore some playing cards there was plenty of money though there wasno food some with more innocent games such as quoits and skittlesthe general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of partly becausenothing certain was known about it partly because there was a vaguefeeling that in the main it was going badlyrostov lived as before with denisov and since their furlough they hadbecome more friendly than ever denisov never spoke of rostovs familybut by the tender friendship his commander showed him rostov felt thatthe elder hussars luckless love for natasha played a part instrengthening their friendship denisov evidently tried to expose rostovto danger as seldom as possible and after an action greeted his safereturn with evident joy on one of his foraging expeditions in adeserted and ruined village to which he had come in search ofprovisions rostov found a family consisting of an old pole and hisdaughter with an infant in arms they were half clad hungry too weakto get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a conveyance rostovbrought them to his quarters placed them in his own lodging and keptthem for some weeks while the old man was recovering one of hiscomrades talking of women began chaffing rostov saying that he wasmore wily than any of them and that it would not be a bad thing if heintroduced to them the pretty polish girl he had saved rostov took thejoke as an insult flared up and said such unpleasant things to theofficer that it was all denisov could do to prevent a duel when theofficer had gone away denisov who did not himself know what rostovsrelations with the polish girl might be began to upbraid him for hisquickness of temper and rostov repliedsay what you like she is like a sister to me and i cant tell youhow it offended me because well for that reasondenisov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the roomwithout looking at rostov as was his way at moments of deep feelingah what a mad bweed you wostovs are he muttered and rostov noticedtears in his eyesin april the troops were enlivened by news of the emperors arrival butrostov had no chance of being present at the review he held atbartenstein as the pavlograds were at the outposts far beyond thatplacethey were bivouacking denisov and rostov were living in an earth hutdug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf thehut was made in the following manner which had then come into vogue atrench was dug three and a half feet wide four feet eight inches deepand eight feet long at one end of the trench steps were cut out andthese formed the entrance and vestibule the trench itself was the roomin which the lucky ones such as the squadron commander had a boardlying on piles at the end opposite the entrance to serve as a table oneach side of the trench the earth was cut out to a breadth of about twoand a half feet and this did duty for bedsteads and couches the roofwas so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trenchand could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the tabledenisov who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his squadronliked him had also a board in the roof at the farther end with a pieceof broken but mended glass in it for a window when it was very coldembers from the soldiers campfire were placed on a bent sheet of ironon the steps in the reception roomas denisov called that part of thehutand it was then so warm that the officers of whom there werealways some with denisov and rostov sat in their shirt sleevesin april rostov was on orderly duty one morning between seven andeight returning after a sleepless night he sent for embers changedhis rainsoaked underclothes said his prayers drank tea got warmthen tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner and hisface glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but hisshirt lay down on his back putting his arms under his head he waspleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few daysfor his last reconnoitering expedition and was awaiting denisov whohad gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talksuddenly he heard denisov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hutevidently much excited rostov moved to the window to see whom he wasspeaking to and saw the quartermaster topcheenkoi ordered you not to let them eat that mashka woot stuff denisov wasshouting and i saw with my own eyes how lazarchuk bwought some fwomthe fieldsi have given the order again and again your honor but they dontobey answered the quartermasterrostov lay down again on his bed and thought complacently let him fussand bustle now my jobs done and im lying downcapitally he couldhear that lavrushkathat sly bold orderly of denisovswas talkingas well as the quartermaster lavrushka was saying something aboutloaded wagons biscuits and oxen he had seen when he had gone out forprovisionsthen denisovs voice was heard shouting farther and farther awaysaddle second platoonwhere are they off to now thought rostovfive minutes later denisov came into the hut climbed with muddy bootson the bed lit his pipe furiously scattered his things about took hisleaded whip buckled on his saber and went out again in answer torostovs inquiry where he was going he answered vaguely and crosslythat he had some businesslet god and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards said denisov goingout and rostov heard the hoofs of several horses splashing through themud he did not even trouble to find out where denisov had gone havinggot warm in his corner he fell asleep and did not leave the hut tilltoward evening denisov had not yet returned the weather had clearedup and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were playing svaykalaughing as they threw their missiles which buried themselves in thesoft mud rostov joined them in the middle of the game the officerssaw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny horsesbehind them the wagons escorted by the hussars drew up to the picketropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded themthere now denisov has been worrying said rostov and here are theprovisionsso they are said the officers wont the soldiers be glada little behind the hussars came denisov accompanied by two infantryofficers with whom he was talkingrostov went to meet themi warn you captain one of the officers a short thin man evidentlyvery angry was sayinghavent i told you i

saddlea dog astwide a fence a weal dog astwide a fence shouted denisovafter him the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to amounted infantryman and riding up to rostov he burst out laughingive taken twansports from the infantwy by force he said after allcant let our men starvethe wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to aninfantry regiment but learning from lavrushka that the transport wasunescorted denisov with his hussars had seized it by force thesoldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely and they even sharedthem with the other squadronsthe next day the regimental commander sent for denisov and holding hisfingers spread out before his eyes saidthis is how i look at this affair i know nothing about it and wontbegin proceedings but i advise you to ride over to the staff and settlethe business there in the commissariat department and if possible sign areceipt for such and such stores received if not as the demand wasbooked against an infantry regiment there will be a row and the affairmay end badlyfrom the regimental commanders denisov rode straight to the staff witha sincere desire to act on this advice in the evening he came back tohis dugout in a state such as rostov had never yet seen him in denisovcould not speak and gasped for breath when rostov asked what was thematter he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarsefeeble voicealarmed at denisovs condition rostov suggested that he should undressdrink some water and send for the doctortwy me for wobbewy oh some more water let them twy me but illalways thwash scoundwels and ill tell the empewo ice hemutteredthe regimental doctor when he came said it was absolutely necessary tobleed denisov a deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy armand

go to the commissioner i enter and atthe table who do you think no but wait a bit who is it thatsstarving us shouted denisov hitting the table with the fist of hisnewly bled arm so violently that the

are you shouting for calm yourself said rostov youve setyour arm bleeding afresh wait we must tie it up againdenisov was bandaged up again and put to bed next day he woke calm andcheerfulbut at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into rostovs anddenisovs dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showedthem a paper addressed to major denisov from the regimental commander inwhich inquiries were made about yesterdays occurrence the adjutanttold them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn that acourtmartial had been appointed and that in view of the severity withwhich marauding and insubordination were now regarded degradation tothe ranks would be the best that could be hoped forthe case as represented by the offended parties was that afterseizing the transports major denisov being drunk went to the chiefquartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief threatenedto strike him and on being led out had rushed into the office and giventwo officials a thrashing and dislocated the arm of one of themin answer to rostovs renewed questions denisov said laughing that hethought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up in it butthat it was all nonsense and rubbish and he did not in the least fearany kind of trial and that if those scoundrels dared attack him hewould give them an answer that they would not easily forgetdenisov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter but rostov knew himtoo well not to detect that while hiding it from others at heart hefeared a courtmartial and was worried over the affair which wasevidently taking a bad turn every day letters of inquiry and noticesfrom the court arrived and on the first of may denisov was ordered tohand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before thestaff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariatoffice on the previous day platov reconnoitered with two cossackregiments and two squadrons of hussars denisov as was his wont rodeout in front of the outposts parading his courage a bullet fired by afrench sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg perhaps atanother time denisov would not have left the regiment for so slight awound but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearingat the staff and went into hospitalin june the battle of friedland was fought in which the pavlograds didnot take part and after that an armistice was proclaimed rostov whofelt his friends absence very much having no news of him since he leftand feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of hisaffairs took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit denisovin hospitalthe hospital was in a small prussian town that had been twice devastatedby russian and french troops because it was summer when it is sobeautiful out in the fields the little town presented a particularlydismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences its foul streetstattered inhabitants and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering aboutthe hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames andpanes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fencethat had been pulled to pieces several bandaged soldiers with paleswollen faces were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in theyarddirectly rostov entered the door he was enveloped by a smell ofputrefaction and hospital air on the stairs he met a russian armydoctor smoking a cigar the doctor was followed by a russian assistanti cant tear myself to pieces the doctor was saying come to makaralexeevich in the evening i shall be therethe assistant asked some further questionsoh do the best you can isnt it all the same the doctor noticedrostov coming upstairswhat do you want sir said the doctor what do you want the bulletshaving spared you do you want to try typhus this is a pesthouse sirhow so asked rostovtyphus sir its death to go in only we two makeev and i hepointed to the assistant keep on here some five of us doctors havedied in this place when a new one comes he is done for in a weeksaid the doctor with evident satisfaction prussian doctors have beeninvited here but our allies dont like it at allrostov explained that he wanted to see major denisov of the hussars whowas woundedi dont know i cant tell you sir only think i am alone in chargeof three hospitals with more than four hundred patients its well thatthe charitable prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee and somelint each month or we should be lost he laughed four hundred sirand theyre always sending me fresh ones there are four

mollitendead i fancy eh makeev queried the doctor in a tone ofindifferencethe assistant however did not confirm the doctors wordsis he tall and with reddish hair asked the doctorrostov described denisovs appearancethere was one like that said the doctor as if pleased that one isdead i fancy however ill look up our list we had a list have yougot it makeevmakar alexeevich has the list answered the assistant but if youllstep into the officers wards youll see for yourself he addedturning to rostovah youd better not go sir said the doctor or you may have tostay here yourselfbut rostov bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant toshow him the wayonly dont blame me the doctor shouted up after himrostov and the assistant went into the dark corridor the smell was sostrong there that rostov held his nose and had to pause and collect hisstrength before he could go on a door opened to the right and anemaciated sallow man on crutches barefoot and in underclothing limpedout and leaning against the doorpost looked with glittering enviouseyes at those who were passing glancing in at the door rostov saw thatthe sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and overcoatsmay i go in and lookwhat is there to see said the assistantbut just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go inrostov entered the soldiers ward the foul air to which he had alreadybegun to get used in the corridor was still stronger here it was alittle different more pungent and one felt that this was where itoriginatedin the long room brightly lit up by the sun through the large windowsthe sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls andleaving a passage in the middle most of them were unconscious and paidno attention to the newcomers those who were conscious raisedthemselves or lifted their thin yellow faces and all looked intently atrostov with the same expression of hope of relief reproach and envyof anothers health rostov went to the middle of the room and lookingthrough the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same thingthere he stood still looking silently around he had not at allexpected such a sight just before him almost across the middle of thepassage on the bare floor lay a sick man probably a cossack to judgeby the cut of his hair the man lay on his back his huge arms and legsoutstretched his face was purple his eyes were rolled back so thatonly the whites were seen and on his bare legs and arms which werestill red the veins stood out like cords he was knocking the back ofhis head against the floor hoarsely uttering some word which he keptrepeating rostov listened and made out the word it was drink drinka drink rostov glanced round looking for someone who would put thisman back in his place and bring him waterwho looks after the sick here he asked the assistantjust then a commissariat soldier a hospital orderly came in from thenext room marching stiffly and drew up in front of rostovgood day your honor he shouted rolling his eyes at rostov andevidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authoritiesget him to his place and give him some water said rostov pointing tothe cossackyes your honor the soldier replied complacently and rolling hiseyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter but did notmoveno its impossible to do anything here thought rostov lowering hiseyes and he was going out but became aware of an intense look fixed onhim on his right and he turned close to the corner on an overcoatsat an old unshaven graybearded soldier as thin as a skeleton with astern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on rostov the mans neighboron one side whispered something to him pointing at rostov who noticedthat the old man wanted to speak to him he drew nearer and saw that theold man had only one leg bent under him the other had been amputatedabove the knee his neighbor on the other side who lay motionless somedistance from him with his head thrown back was a young soldier with asnub nose his pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes wererolled back rostov looked at the young soldier and a cold chill randown his backwhy this one seems he began turning to the assistantand how weve been begging your honor said the old soldier his jawquivering hes been dead since morning after all were men notdogsill send someone at once he shall be taken awaytaken away at oncesaid the assistant hurriedly let us go your honoryes yes let us go said rostov hastily and lowering his eyes andshrinking he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of reproachfulenvious eyes that were fixed upon him and went out of the roomgoing along the corridor the assistant led rostov to the officerswards consisting of three rooms the doors of which stood open therewere beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying orsitting on them some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressinggowns the first person rostov met in the officers ward was a thinlittle man with one arm who was walking about the first room in anightcap and hospital dressing gown with a pipe between his teethrostov looked at him trying to remember where he had seen him beforesee where weve met again said the little man tushin tushin dontyou remember who gave you a lift at schon grabern and ive had a bitcut off you see he went on with a smile pointing to the emptysleeve of his dressing gown looking for vasili dmitrich denisov myneighbor he added when he heard who rostov wanted here here andtushin led him into the next room from whence came sounds of severallaughing voiceshow can they laugh or even live at all here thought rostov stillaware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong in thesoldiers ward and still seeming to see fixed on him those enviouslooks which had followed him out from both sides and the face of thatyoung soldier with eyes rolled backdenisov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket though itwas nearly noonah wostov how are you how are you he called out still in the samevoice as in the regiment but rostov noticed sadly that under thishabitual ease and animation some new sinister hidden feeling showeditself in the expression of denisovs face and the intonations of hisvoicehis wound though a slight one had not yet healed even now six weeksafter he had been hit his face had the same swollen pallor as the facesof the other hospital patients but it was not this that struck rostovwhat struck him was that denisov did not seem glad to see him andsmiled at him unnaturally he did not ask about the regiment nor aboutthe general state of affairs and when rostov spoke of these matters didnot listenrostov even noticed that denisov did not like to be reminded of theregiment or in general of that other free life which was going onoutside the hospital he seemed to try to forget that old life and wasonly interested in the affair with the commissariat officers onrostovs inquiry as to how the matter stood he at once produced fromunder his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and therough draft of his answer to it he became animated when he beganreading his paper and specially drew rostovs attention to the stingingrejoinders he made to his enemies his hospital companions who hadgathered round rostova fresh arrival from the world outsidegraduallybegan to disperse as soon as denisov began reading his answer rostovnoticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had already heard thatstory more than once and were tired of it only the man who had the nextbed a stout uhlan continued to sit on his bed gloomily frowning andsmoking a pipe and little onearmed tushin still listened shaking hishead disapprovingly in the middle of the reading the uhlan interrupteddenisovbut what i say is he said turning to rostov it would be bestsimply to petition the emperor for pardon they say great rewards willnow be distributed and surely a pardon would be grantedme petition the empewo exclaimed denisov in a voice to which hetried hard to give the old energy and fire but which sounded like anexpression of irritable impotence what for if i were a wobber i wouldask mercy but im being courtmartialed for bwinging wobbers to booklet them twy me im not afwaid of anyone ive served the tsar and mycountwy honowably and have not stolen and am i to be degwadedlisten im witing to them stwaight this is what i say if i hadwobbed the tweasuwyits certainly well written said tushin but thats not the pointvasili dmitrich and he also turned to rostov one has to submit andvasili dmitrich doesnt want to you know the auditor told you it was abad businesswell let it be bad said denisovthe auditor wrote out a petition for you continued tushin and youought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it no doubt heindicating rostov has connections on the staff you wont find abetter opportunityhavent i said im not going to gwovel denisov interrupted him wenton reading his paperrostov had not the courage to persuade denisov though he instinctivelyfelt that the way advised by tushin and the other officers was thesafest and though he would have been glad to be of service to denisovhe knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty temperwhen the reading of denisovs virulent reply which took more than anhour was over rostov said nothing and he spent the rest of the day ina most dejected state of mind amid denisovs hospital comrades who hadgathered round him telling them what he knew and listening to theirstories denisov was moodily silent all the eveninglate in the evening when rostov was about to leave he asked denisovwhether he had no commission for himyes wait a bit said denisov glancing round at the officers andtaking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window where hehad an inkpot and sat down to writeit seems its no use knocking ones head against a wall he saidcoming from the window and giving rostov a large envelope in it was thepetition to the emperor drawn up by the auditor in which denisovwithout alluding to the offenses of the commissariat officials simplyasked for pardonhand it in it seemshe did not finish but gave a painfully unnatural smilehaving returned to the regiment and told the commander the state ofdenisovs affairs rostov rode to tilsit with the letter to the emperoron the thirteenth of june the french and russian emperors arrived intilsit boris drubetskoy had asked the important personage on whom hewas in attendance to include him in the suite appointed for the stay attilsiti should like to see the great man he said alluding to napoleonwhom hitherto he like everyone else had always called buonaparteyou are speaking of buonaparte asked the general smilingboris looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he wasbeing testedi am speaking prince of the emperor napoleon he replied thegeneral patted him on the shoulder with a smileyou will go far he said and took him to tilsit with himboris was among the few present at the niemen on the day the twoemperors met he saw the raft decorated with monograms saw napoleonpass before the french guards on the farther bank of the river saw thepensive face of the emperor alexander as he sat in silence in a tavernon the bank of the niemen awaiting napoleons arrival saw both emperorsget into boats and saw how napoleonreaching the raft firststeppedquickly forward to meet alexander and held out his hand to him and howthey both retired into the pavilion since he had begun to move in thehighest circles boris had made it his habit to watch attentively allthat went on around him and to note it down at the time of the meetingat tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with napoleon andabout the uniforms they wore and listened attentively to words spokenby important personages at the moment the emperors went into thepavilion he looked at his watch and did not forget to look at it againwhen alexander came out the interview had lasted an hour and fiftythree minutes he noted this down that same evening among other factshe felt to be of historic importance as the emperors suite was a verysmall one it was a matter of great importance for a man who valued hissuccess in the service to be at tilsit on the occasion of thisinterview between the two emperors and having succeeded in this borisfelt that henceforth his position was fully assured he had not onlybecome known but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted himtwice he had executed commissions to the emperor himself so that thelatter knew his face and all those at court far from coldshoulderinghim as at first when they considered him a newcomer would now have beensurprised had he been absentboris lodged with another adjutant the polish count zhilinskizhilinski a pole brought up in paris was rich and passionately fondof the french and almost every day of the stay at tilsit frenchofficers of the guard and from french headquarters were dining andlunching with him and borison the evening of the twentyfourth of june count zhilinski arranged asupper for his french friends the guest of honor was an aidedecamp ofnapoleons there were also several french officers of the guard and apage of napoleons a young lad of an old aristocratic french familythat same day rostov profiting by the darkness to avoid beingrecognized in civilian dress came to tilsit and went to the lodgingoccupied by boris and zhilinskirostov in common with the whole army from which he came was far fromhaving experienced the change of feeling toward napoleon and the frenchwho from being foes had suddenly become friendsthat had taken placeat headquarters and in boris in the army bonaparte and the french werestill regarded with mingled feelings of anger contempt and fear onlyrecently talking with one of platovs cossack officers rostov hadargued that if napoleon were taken prisoner he would be treated not as asovereign but as a criminal quite lately happening to meet a woundedfrench colonel on the road rostov had maintained with heat that peacewas impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the criminalbonaparte rostov was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence offrench officers in boris lodging dressed in uniforms he had beenaccustomed to see from quite a different point of view from the outpostsof the flank as soon as he noticed a french officer who thrust hishead out of the door that warlike feeling of hostility which he alwaysexperienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him he stopped atthe threshold and asked in russian whether drubetskoy lived thereboris hearing a strange voice in the anteroom came out to meet him anexpression of annoyance showed itself for a moment on his face on firstrecognizing rostovah its you very glad very glad to see you he said howevercoming toward him with a smile but rostov had noticed his firstimpulseive come at a bad time i think i should not have come but i havebusiness he said coldlyno i only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment dansun moment je suis a vous  he said answering someone who called him in a minute i shall be at your disposali see im intruding rostov repeatedthe look of annoyance had already disappeared from boris face havingevidently reflected and decided how to act he very quietly took bothrostovs hands and led him into the next room his eyes lookingserenely and steadily at rostov seemed to be veiled by something as ifscreened by blue spectacles of conventionality so it seemed to rostovoh come now as if you could come at a wrong time said boris and heled him into the room where the supper table was laid and introduced himto his guests explaining that he was not a civilian but an hussarofficer and an old friend of hiscount zhilinskile comte n nle capitaine s s said he naminghis guests rostov looked frowningly at the frenchmen bowedreluctantly and remained silentzhilinski evidently did not receive this new russian person verywillingly into his circle and did not speak to rostov boris did notappear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and with the samepleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which hehad met rostov tried to enliven the conversation one of the frenchmenwith the politeness characteristic of his countrymen addressed theobstinately taciturn rostov saying that the latter had probably come totilsit to see the emperorno i came on business replied rostov brieflyrostov had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look ofdissatisfaction on boris face and as always happens to those in a badhumor it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion andthat he was in everybodys way he really was in their way for he alonetook no part in the conversation which again became general the looksthe visitors cast on him seemed to say and what is he sitting herefor he rose and went up to borisanyhow im in your way he said in a low tone come and talk over mybusiness and ill go awayoh no not at all said boris but if you are tired come and liedown in my room and have a restyes reallythey went into the little room where boris slept rostov withoutsitting down began at once irritably as if boris were to blame insome way telling him about denisovs affair asking him whetherthrough his general he could and would intercede with the emperor ondenisovs behalf and get denisovs petition handed in when he and boriswere alone rostov felt for the first time that he could not look borisin the face without a sense of awkwardness boris with one leg crossedover the other and stroking his left hand with the slender fingers ofhis right listened to rostov as a general listens to the report of asubordinate now looking aside and now gazing straight into rostovseyes with the same veiled look each time this happened rostov feltuncomfortable and cast down his eyesi have heard of such cases and know that his majesty is very severe insuch affairs i think it would be best not to bring it before theemperor but to apply to the commander of the corps but in generali thinkso you dont want to do anything well then say so rostov almostshouted not looking boris in the faceboris smiledon the contrary i will do what i can only i thoughtat that moment zhilinskis voice was heard calling boriswell then go go go said rostov and refusing supper andremaining alone in the little room he walked up and down for a longtime hearing the lighthearted french conversation from the next roomrostov had come to tilsit the day least suitable for a petition ondenisovs behalf he could not himself go to the general in attendanceas he was in mufti and had come to tilsit without permission to do soand boris even had he wished to could not have done so on thefollowing day on that day june  the preliminaries of peace weresigned the emperors exchanged decorations alexander received the crossof the legion of honor and napoleon the order of st andrew of the firstdegree and a dinner had been arranged for the evening given by abattalion of the french guards to the preobrazhensk battalion theemperors were to be present at that banquetrostov felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with boris that when thelatter looked in after supper he pretended to be asleep and early nextmorning went away avoiding boris in his civilian clothes and a roundhat he wandered about the town staring at the french and theiruniforms and at the streets and houses where the russian and frenchemperors were staying in a square he saw tables being set up andpreparations made for the dinner he saw the russian and french colorsdraped from side to side of the streets with huge monograms a and n inthe windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayedboris doesnt want to help me and i dont want to ask him thatssettled thought nicholas all is over between us but i wont leavehere without having done all i can for denisov and certainly not withoutgetting his letter to the emperor the emperor he is here thoughtrostov who had unconsciously returned to the house where alexanderlodgedsaddled horses were standing before the house and the suite wereassembling evidently preparing for the emperor to come outi may see him at any moment thought rostov if only i were to handthe letter direct to him and tell him all could they really arrest mefor my civilian clothes surely not he would understand on whose sidejustice lies he understands everything knows everything who can bemore just more magnanimous than he and even if they did arrest me forbeing here what would it matter thought he looking at an officer whowas entering the house the emperor occupied after all people do goin its all nonsense ill go in and hand the letter to the emperormyself so much the worse for drubetskoy who drives me to it andsuddenly with a determination he himself did not expect rostov felt forthe letter in his pocket and went straight to the houseno i wont miss my opportunity now as i did after austerlitz hethought expecting every moment to meet the monarch and conscious ofthe blood that rushed to his heart at the thought i will fall at hisfeet and beseech him he will lift me up will listen and will eventhank me i am happy when i can do good but to remedy injustice is thegreatest happiness rostov fancied the sovereign saying and passingpeople who looked after him with curiosity he entered the porch of theemperors housea broad staircase led straight up from the entry and to the right hesaw a closed door below under the staircase was a door leading to thelower floorwhom do you want someone inquiredto hand in a letter a petition to his majesty said nicholas with atremor in his voicea petition this way to the officer on duty he was shown the doorleading downstairs only it wont be acceptedon hearing this indifferent voice rostov grew frightened at what he wasdoing the thought of meeting the emperor at any moment was sofascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run awaybut the official who had questioned him opened the door and rostoventereda short stout man of about thirty in white breeches and high boots anda batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on standing in thatroom and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a newpair of handsome silkembroidered braces that for some reasonattracted rostovs attention this man was speaking to someone in theadjoining rooma good figure and in her first bloom he was saying but on seeingrostov he stopped short and frownedwhat is it a petitionwhat is it asked the person in the other roomanother petitioner answered the man with the bracestell him to come later hell be coming out directly we must golater later tomorrow its too laterostov turned and was about to go but the man in the braces stoppedhimwhom have you come from who are youi come from major denisov answered rostovare you an officerlieutenant count rostovwhat audacity hand it in through your commander and go along withyou go and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed himrostov went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there weremany officers and generals in full parade uniform whom he had to passcursing his temerity his heart sinking at the thought of findinghimself at any moment face to face with the emperor and being put toshame and arrested in his presence fully alive now to the improprietyof his conduct and repenting of it rostov with downcast eyes wasmaking his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when afamiliar voice called him and a hand detained himwhat are you doing here sir in civilian dress asked a deep voiceit was a cavalry general who had obtained the emperors special favorduring this campaign and who had formerly commanded the division inwhich rostov was servingrostov in dismay began justifying himself but seeing the kindlyjocular face of the general he took him aside and in an excited voicetold him the whole affair asking him to intercede for denisov whom thegeneral knew having heard rostov to the end the general shook his headgravelyim sorry sorry for that fine fellow give me the letterhardly had rostov handed him the letter and finished explainingdenisovs case when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard onthe stairs and the general leaving him went to the porch thegentlemen of the emperors suite ran down the stairs and went to theirhorses hayne the same groom who had been at austerlitz led up theemperors horse and the faint creak of a footstep rostov knew at oncewas heard on the stairs forgetting the danger of being recognizedrostov went close to the porch together with some inquisitivecivilians and again after two years saw those features he adoredthat same face and same look and step and the same union of majesty andmildness and the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereignrose again in rostovs soul in all its old force in the uniform of thepreobrazhensk regimentwhite chamoisleather breeches and high bootsand wearing a star rostov did not know it was that of the legiondhonneur the monarch came out into the porch putting on his glovesand carrying his hat under his arm he stopped and looked about himbrightening everything around by his glance he spoke a few words tosome of the generals and recognizing the former commander of rostovsdivision smiled and beckoned to himall the suite drew back and rostov saw the general talking for some timeto the emperorthe emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horseagain the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers among whomwas rostov moved nearer to the emperor stopping beside his horse withhis hand on the saddle the emperor turned to the cavalry general andsaid in a loud voice evidently wishing to be heard by alli cannot do it general i cannot because the law is stronger than iand he raised his foot to the stirrupthe general bowed his head respectfully and the monarch mounted androde down the street at a gallop beside himself with enthusiasm rostovran after him with the crowdthe emperor rode to the square where facing one another a battalion ofthe preobrazhensk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of thefrench guards in their bearskin caps on the leftas the tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions which presentedarms another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank andat the head of them rostov recognized napoleon it could be no one elsehe came at a gallop wearing a small hat a blue uniform open over awhite vest and the st andrew ribbon over his shoulder he was riding avery fine thoroughbred gray arab horse with a crimson goldembroideredsaddlecloth on approaching alexander he raised his hat and as he didso rostov with his cavalrymans eye could not help noticing thatnapoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle the battalionsshouted hurrah and vive lempereur napoleon said something toalexander and both emperors dismounted and took each others handsnapoleons face wore an unpleasant and artificial smile alexander wassaying something affable to himin spite of the trampling of the french gendarmes horses which werepushing back the crowd rostov kept his eyes on every movement ofalexander and bonaparte it struck him as a surprise that alexandertreated bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease withthe tsar as if such relations with an emperor were an everyday matterto himalexander and napoleon with the long train of their suites approachedthe right flank of the preobrazhensk battalion and came straight up tothe crowd standing there the crowd unexpectedly found itself so closeto the emperors that rostov standing in the front row was afraid hemight be recognizedsire i ask your permission to present the legion of honor to thebravest of your soldiers said a sharp precise voice articulatingevery letterthis was said by the undersized napoleon looking up straight intoalexanders eyes alexander listened attentively to what was said to himand bending his head smiled pleasantlyto him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war addednapoleon accentuating each syllable as with a composure and assuranceexasperating to rostov he ran his eyes over the russian ranks drawn upbefore him who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on theiremperorwill your majesty allow me to consult the colonel said alexander andtook a few hasty steps toward prince kozlovski the commander of thebattalionbonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white handtore it in doing so and threw it away an aidedecamp behind himrushed forward and picked it upto whom shall it be given the emperor alexander asked koslovski inrussian in a low voiceto whomever your majesty commandsthe emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and glancing backremarkedbut we must give him an answerkozlovski scanned the ranks resolutely and included rostov in hisscrutinycan it be me thought rostovlazarev the colonel called with a frown and lazarev the firstsoldier in the rank stepped briskly forwardwhere are you off to stop here voices whispered to lazarev who didnot know where to go lazarev stopped casting a sidelong look at hiscolonel in alarm his face twitched as often happens to soldiers calledbefore the ranksnapoleon slightly turned his head and put his plump little hand outbehind him as if to take something the members of his suite guessingat once what he wanted moved about and whispered as they passedsomething from one to another and a pagethe same one rostov had seenthe previous evening at borisran forward and bowing respectfullyover the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a moment laid init an order on a red ribbon napoleon without looking pressed twofingers together and the badge was between them then he approachedlazarev who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own monarchlooked round at the emperor alexander to imply that what he was nowdoing was done for the sake of his ally and the small white handholding the order touched one of lazarevs buttons it was as ifnapoleon knew that it was only necessary for his hand to deign to touchthat soldiers breast for the soldier to be forever happy rewarded anddistinguished from everyone else in the world napoleon merely laid thecross on lazarevs breast and dropping his hand turned towardalexander as though sure that the cross would adhere there and itreally didofficious hands russian and french immediately seized the cross andfastened it to the uniform lazarev glanced morosely at the little manwith white hands who was doing something to him and still standingmotionless presenting arms looked again straight into alexanders eyesas if asking whether he should stand there or go away or do somethingelse but receiving no orders he remained for some time in that rigidpositionthe emperors remounted and rode away the preobrazhensk battalionbreaking rank mingled with the french guards and sat down at the tablesprepared for themlazarev sat in the place of honor russian and french officers embracedhim congratulated him and pressed his hands crowds of officers andcivilians drew near merely to see him a rumble of russian and frenchvoices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square twoofficers with flushed faces looking cheerful and happy passed byrostovwhat dyou think of the treat all on silver plate one of them wassaying have you seen lazarevi havetomorrow i hear the preobrazhenskis will give them a

emperor will send a st georgescross to the bravest of the french guards it has to be done he mustrespond in kindboris too with his friend zhilinski came to see the preobrazhenskbanquet on his way back he noticed rostov standing by the corner of ahouserostov how dyou do we missed one another he said and could notrefrain from asking what was the matter so strangely dismal andtroubled was rostovs facenothing nothing replied rostovyoull call roundyes i willrostov stood at that corner for a long time watching the feast from adistance in his mind a painful process was going on which he could notbring to a conclusion terrible doubts rose in his soul now heremembered denisov with his changed expression his submission and thewhole hospital with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease sovividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he lookedround to see where the smell came from next he thought of that selfsatisfied bonaparte with his small white hand who was now an emperorliked and respected by alexander then why those severed arms and legsand those dead men then again he thought of lazarev rewarded anddenisov punished and unpardoned he caught himself harboring suchstrange thoughts that he was frightenedthe smell of the food the preobrazhenskis were eating and a sense ofhunger recalled him from these reflections he had to get something toeat before going away he went to a hotel he had noticed that morningthere he found so many people among them officers who like himselfhad come in civilian clothes that he had difficulty in getting adinner two officers of his own division joined him the conversationnaturally turned on the peace the officers his comrades like most ofthe army were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle offriedland they said that had we held out a little longer napoleon wouldhave been done for as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunitionnicholas ate and drank chiefly the latter in silence he finished acouple of bottles of wine by himself the process in his mind went ontormenting him without reaching a conclusion he feared to give way tohis thoughts yet could not get rid of them suddenly on one of theofficers saying that it was humiliating to look at the french rostovbegan shouting with uncalledfor wrath and therefore much to thesurprise of the officershow can you judge whats best he cried the blood suddenly rushing tohis face how can you judge the emperors actions what right have weto argue we cannot comprehend either the emperors aims or hisactionsbut i never said a word about the emperor said the officerjustifying himself and unable to understand rostovs outburst excepton the supposition that he was drunkbut rostov did not listen to himwe are not diplomatic officials we are soldiers and nothing more hewent on if we are ordered to die we must die if were punished itmeans that we have deserved it its not for us to judge if the emperorpleases to recognize bonaparte as emperor and to conclude an alliancewith him it means that that is the right thing to do if once we beginjudging and arguing about everything nothing sacred will be left thatway we shall be saying there is no godnothing shouted nicholasbanging the tablevery little to the point as it seemed to hislisteners but quite relevantly to the course of his own thoughtsour business is to do our duty to fight and not to think thatsall said heand to drink said one of the officers not wishing to quarrelyes and to drink assented nicholas hullo there another bottlehe shoutedin  the emperor alexander went to erfurt for a fresh interview withthe emperor napoleon and in the upper circles of petersburg there wasmuch talk of the grandeur of this important meetingin  the intimacy between the worlds two arbiters as napoleon andalexander were called was such that when napoleon declared war onaustria a russian corps crossed the frontier to cooperate with our oldenemy bonaparte against our old ally the emperor of austria and incourt circles the possibility of marriage between napoleon and one ofalexanders sisters was spoken of but besides considerations of foreignpolicy the attention of russian society was at that time keenlydirected on the internal changes that were being undertaken in all thedepartments of governmentlife meanwhilereal life with its essential interests of health andsickness toil and rest and its intellectual interests in thoughtscience poetry music love friendship hatred and passionswent onas usual independently of and apart from political friendship or enmitywith napoleon bonaparte and from all the schemes of reconstructionprince andrew had spent two years continuously in the countryall the plans pierre had attempted on his estatesand constantlychanging from one thing to another had never accomplishedwere carriedout by prince andrew without display and without perceptible difficultyhe had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which pierre lackedand without fuss or strain on his part this set things goingon one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and becamefree agricultural laborersthis being one of the first examples of thekind in russia on other estates the serfs compulsory labor wascommuted for a quitrent a trained midwife was engaged for bogucharovoat his expense and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing tothe children of the peasants and household serfsprince andrew spent half his time at bald hills with his father and hisson who was still in the care of nurses the other half he spent inbogucharovo cloister as his father called prince andrews estatedespite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had expressed topierre he diligently followed all that went on received many booksand to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had visitors frompetersburg the very vortex of life these people lagged behind himselfwho never left the countryin knowledge of what was happening in homeand foreign affairsbesides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety ofbooks prince andrew was at this time busy with a critical survey of ourlast two unfortunate campaigns and with drawing up a proposal for areform of the army rules and regulationsin the spring of  he went to visit the ryazan estates which had beeninherited by his son whose guardian he waswarmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the caleche looking at the newgrass the first leaves on the birches and the first puffs of whitespring clouds floating across the clear blue sky he was not thinking ofanything but looked absentmindedly and cheerfully from side to sidethey crossed the ferry where he had talked with pierre the year beforethey went through the muddy village past threshing floors and greenfields of winter rye downhill where snow still lodged near the bridgeuphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain past strips ofstubble land and bushes touched with green here and there and into abirch forest growing on both sides of the road in the forest it wasalmost hot no wind could be felt the birches with their sticky greenleaves were motionless and lilaccolored flowers and the first bladesof green grass were pushing up and lifting last years leaves thecoarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and thereamong the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter on entering theforest the horses began to snort and sweated visiblypeter the footman made some remark to the coachman the latter assentedbut apparently the coachmans sympathy was not enough for peter and heturned on the box toward his masterhow pleasant it is your excellency he said with a respectful smilewhatits pleasant your excellencywhat is he talking about thought prince andrew oh the spring isuppose he thought as he turned round yes really everything isgreen already how early the birches and cherry and alders too arecoming out but the oaks show no sign yet ah here is one oakat the edge of the road stood an oak probably ten times the age of thebirches that formed the forest it was ten times as thick and twice astall as they it was an enormous tree its girth twice as great as a mancould embrace and evidently long ago some of its branches had beenbroken off and its bark scarred with its huge ungainly limbs sprawlingunsymmetrically and its gnarled hands and fingers it stood an agedstern and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees only thedeadlooking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest and this oakrefused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring orthe sunshinespring love happiness this oak seemed to say are you not weary ofthat stupid meaningless constantly repeated fraud always the same andalways a fraud there is no spring no sun no happiness look at thosecramped dead firs ever the same and at me too sticking out my brokenand barked fingers just where they have grown whether from my back ormy sides as they have grown so i stand and i do not believe in yourhopes and your liesas he passed through the forest prince andrew turned several times tolook at that oak as if expecting something from it under the oak toowere flowers and grass but it stood among them scowling rigidmisshapen and grim as everyes the oak is right a thousand times right thought prince andrewlet othersthe youngyield afresh to that fraud but we know lifeour life is finisheda whole sequence of new thoughts hopeless but mournfully pleasant rosein his soul in connection with that tree during this journey he as itwere considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusionrestful in its hopelessness that it was not for him to begin anythinganewbut that he must live out his life content to do no harm and notdisturbing himself or desiring anythingprince andrew had to see the marshal of the nobility for the district inconnection with the affairs of the ryazan estate of which he wastrustee this marshal was count ilya rostov and in the middle of mayprince andrew went to visit himit was now hot spring weather the whole forest was already clothed ingreen it was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed tobatheprince andrew depressed and preoccupied with the business about whichhe had to speak to the marshal was driving up the avenue in the groundsof the rostovs house at otradnoe he heard merry girlish cries behindsome trees on the right and saw a group of girls running to cross thepath of his caleche ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a darkhaired remarkably slim pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress with awhite handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hairescaped the girl was shouting something but seeing that he was astranger ran back laughing without looking at himsuddenly he did not know why he felt a pang the day was so beautifulthe sun so bright everything around so gay but that slim pretty girldid not know or wish to know of his existence and was contented andcheerful in her own separateprobably foolishbut bright and happylife what is she so glad about what is she thinking of not of themilitary regulations or of the arrangement of the ryazan serfsquitrents of what is she thinking why is she so happy prince andrewasked himself with instinctive curiosityin  count ilya rostov was living at otradnoe just as he had done informer years that is entertaining almost the whole province withhunts theatricals dinners and music he was glad to see princeandrew as he was to see any new visitor and insisted on his stayingthe nightduring the dull day in the course of which he was entertained by hiselderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors the old countshouse was crowded on account of an approaching name day prince andrewrepeatedly glanced at natasha gay and laughing among the youngermembers of the company and asked himself each time what is shethinking about why is she so gladthat night alone in new surroundings he was long unable to sleep heread awhile and then put out his candle but relit it it was hot in theroom the inside shutters of which were closed he was cross with thestupid old man as he called rostov who had made him stay by assuringhim that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town and hewas vexed with himself for having stayedhe got up and went to the window to open it as soon as he opened theshutters the moonlight as if it had long been watching for this burstinto the room he opened the casement the night was fresh bright andvery still just before the window was a row of pollard trees lookingblack on one side and with a silvery light on the other beneath thetrees grew some kind of lush wet bushy vegetation with silverlitleaves and stems here and there farther back beyond the dark trees aroof glittered with dew to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantlywhite trunk and branches and above it shone the moon nearly at itsfull in a pale almost starless spring sky prince andrew leaned hiselbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that skyhis room was on the first floor those in the rooms above were alsoawake he heard female voices overheadjust once more said a girlish voice above him which prince andrewrecognized at oncebut when are you coming to bed replied another voicei wont i cant sleep whats the use come now for the last timetwo girlish voices sang a musical passagethe end of some songoh how lovely now go to sleep and theres an end of ityou go to sleep but i cant said the first voice coming nearer tothe window she was evidently leaning right out for the rustle of herdress and even her breathing could be heard everything was stonestilllike the moon and its light and the shadows prince andrew too darednot stir for fear of betraying his unintentional presencesonya sonya he again heard the first speaker oh how can yousleep only look how glorious it is ah how glorious do wake upsonya she said almost with tears in her voice there never never wassuch a lovely night beforesonya made some reluctant replydo just come and see what a moon oh how lovely come heredarling sweetheart come here there you see i feel like sitting downon my heels putting my arms round my knees like this straining tightas tight as possible and flying away like thistake care youll fall outhe heard the sound of a scuffle and sonyas disapproving voice itspast one oclockoh you only spoil things for me all right go goagain all was silent but prince andrew knew she was still sittingthere from time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigho god o god what does it mean she suddenly exclaimed to bed thenif it must be and she slammed the casementfor her i might as well not exist thought prince andrew while helistened to her voice for some reason expecting yet fearing that shemight say something about him there she is again as if it were onpurpose thought hein his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthfulthoughts and hopes contrary to the whole tenor of his life that unableto explain his condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at oncenext morning having taken leave of no one but the count and notwaiting for the ladies to appear prince andrew set off for homeit was already the beginning of june when on his return journey he droveinto the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange andmemorable an impression on him in the forest the harness bells soundedyet more muffled than they had done six weeks before for now all wasthick shady and dense and the young firs dotted about in the forestdid not jar on the general beauty but lending themselves to the moodaround were delicately green with fluffy young shootsthe whole day had been hot somewhere a storm was gathering but only asmall cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly sprinkling the roadand the sappy leaves the left side of the forest was dark in the shadethe right side glittered in the sunlight wet and shiny and scarcelyswayed by the breeze everything was in blossom the nightingalestrilled and their voices reverberated now near now far awayyes here in this forest was that oak with which i agreed thoughtprince andrew but where is it he again wondered gazing at the leftside of the road and without recognizing it he looked with admirationat the very oak he sought the old oak quite transfigured spreadingout a canopy of sappy darkgreen foliage stood rapt and slightlytrembling in the rays of the evening sun neither gnarled fingers norold scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence nowthrough the hard centuryold bark even where there were no twigsleaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old veterancould have producedyes it is the same oak thought prince andrew and all at once he wasseized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal all thebest moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory austerlitz withthe lofty heavens his wifes dead reproachful face pierre at theferry that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night and that nightitself and the moon and all this rushed suddenly to his mindno life is not over at thirtyone prince andrew suddenly decidedfinally and decisively it is not enough for me to know what i have inmeeveryone must know it pierre and that young girl who wanted to flyaway into the sky everyone must know me so that my life may not belived for myself alone while others live so apart from it but so thatit may be reflected in them all and they and i may live in harmonyon reaching home prince andrew decided to go to petersburg that autumnand found all sorts of reasons for this decision a whole series ofsensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for himto go to petersburg and even to reenter the service kept springing upin his mind he could not now understand how he could ever even havedoubted the necessity of taking an active share in life just as a monthbefore he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet countrycould ever enter his head it now seemed clear to him that all hisexperience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it tosome kind of work and again played an active part in life he did noteven remember how formerly on the strength of similar wretched logicalarguments it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself ifhe now after the lessons he had had in life allowed himself to believein the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happinessor love now reason suggested quite the opposite after that journey toryazan he found the country dull his former pursuits no longerinterested him and often when sitting alone in his study he got upwent to the mirror and gazed a long time at his own face then he wouldturn away to the portrait of his dead lise who with hair curled a lagrecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame she didnot now say those former terrible words to him but looked simplymerrily and inquisitively at him and prince andrew crossing his armsbehind him long paced the room now frowning now smiling as hereflected on those irrational inexpressible thoughts secret as acrime which altered his whole life and were connected with pierre withfame with the girl at the window the oak and womans beauty and loveand if anyone came into his room at such moments he was particularlycold stern and above all unpleasantly logicalmy dear princess mary entering at such a moment would say littlenicholas cant go out today its very coldif it were hot prince andrew would reply at such times very dryly tohis sister he could go out in his smock but as it is cold he mustwear warm clothes which were designed for that purpose that is whatfollows from the fact that it is cold and not that a child who needsfresh air should remain at home he would add with extreme logic as ifpunishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that stirredwithin himat such moments princess mary would think how intellectual work driesmen upprince andrew arrived in petersburg in august  it was the timewhen the youthful speranski was at the zenith of his fame and hisreforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy that sameaugust the emperor was thrown from his caleche injured his leg andremained three weeks at peterhof receiving speranski every day and noone else at that time the two famous decrees were being prepared thatso agitated societyabolishing court ranks and introducing examinationsto qualify for the grades of collegiate assessor and state councilorand not merely these but a whole state constitution intended to changethe existing order of government in russia legal administrative andfinancial from the council of state down to the district tribunals nowthose vague liberal dreams with which the emperor alexander had ascendedthe throne and which he had tried to put into effect with the aid ofhis associates czartoryski novosiltsev kochubey and strogonovwhomhe himself in jest had called his comite de salut publicwere takingshape and being realizednow all these men were replaced by speranski on the civil side andarakcheev on the military soon after his arrival prince andrew as agentleman of the chamber presented himself at court and at a levee theemperor though he met him twice did not favor him with a single wordit had always seemed to prince andrew before that he was antipathetic tothe emperor and that the latter disliked his face and personalitygenerally and in the cold repellent glance the emperor gave him henow found further confirmation of this surmise the courtiers explainedthe emperors neglect of him by his majestys displeasure at bolkonskisnot having served since i know myself that one cannot help ones sympathies and antipathiesthought prince andrew so it will not do to present my proposal for thereform of the army regulations to the emperor personally but theproject will speak for itselfhe mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal a friend ofhis fathers the field marshal made an appointment to see him receivedhim graciously and promised to inform the emperor a few days laterprince andrew received notice that he was to go to see the minister ofwar count arakcheevon the appointed day prince andrew entered count arakcheevs waitingroom at nine in the morninghe did not know arakcheev personally had never seen him and all he hadheard of him inspired him with but little respect for the manhe is minister of war a man trusted by the emperor and i need notconcern myself about his personal qualities he has been commissioned toconsider my project so he alone can get it adopted thought princeandrew as he waited among a number of important and unimportant peoplein count arakcheevs waiting roomduring his service chiefly as an adjutant prince andrew had seen theanterooms of many important men and the different types of such roomswere well known to him count arakcheevs anteroom had quite a specialcharacter the faces of the unimportant people awaiting their turn foran audience showed embarrassment and servility the faces of those ofhigher rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness covered by a maskof unconcern and ridicule of themselves their situation and the personfor whom they were waiting some walked thoughtfully up and down otherswhispered and laughed prince andrew heard the nickname silaandreevich and the words uncle will give it to us hot in referenceto count arakcheev one general an important personage evidentlyfeeling offended at having to wait so long sat crossing and uncrossinghis legs and smiling contemptuously to himselfbut the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all facesthat of fear prince andrew for the second time asked the adjutant onduty to take in his name but received an ironical look and was toldthat his turn would come in due course after some others had been shownin and out of the ministers room by the adjutant on duty an officerwho struck prince andrew by his humiliated and frightened air wasadmitted at that terrible door this officers audience lasted a longtime then suddenly the grating sound of a harsh voice was heard fromthe other side of the door and the officerwith pale face andtrembling lipscame out and passed through the waiting room clutchinghis headafter this prince andrew was conducted to the door and the officer onduty said in a whisper to the right at the windowprince andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man offorty with a long waist a long closely cropped head deep wrinklesscowling brows above dull greenishhazel eyes and an overhanging rednose arakcheev turned his head toward him without looking at himwhat is your petition asked arakcheevi am not petitioning your excellency returned prince andrew quietlyarakcheevs eyes turned toward himsit down said he prince bolkonskii am not petitioning about anything his majesty the emperor hasdeigned to send your excellency a project submitted by meyou see my dear sir i have read your project interrupted arakcheevuttering only the first words amiably and thenagain without looking atprince andrewrelapsing gradually into a tone of grumbling contemptyou are proposing new military laws there are many laws but no one tocarry out the old ones nowadays everybody designs laws it is easierwriting than doingi came at his majesty the emperors wish to learn from your excellencyhow you propose to deal with the memorandum i have presented saidprince andrew politelyi have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to thecommittee i do not approve of it said arakcheev rising and taking apaper from his writing table here and he handed it to prince andrewacross the paper was scrawled in pencil without capital lettersmisspelled and without punctuation unsoundly constructed becauseresembles an imitation of the french military code and from the articlesof war needlessly deviatingto what committee has the memorandum been referred inquired princeandrewto the committee on army regulations and i have recommended that yourhonor should be appointed a member but without a salaryprince andrew smiledi dont want onea member without salary repeated arakcheev i have the honor ehcall the next one who else is there he shouted bowing to princeandrewwhile waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committeeprince andrew looked up his former acquaintances particularly those heknew to be in power and whose aid he might need in petersburg he nowexperienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle whentroubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the rulingcircles where the future on which the fate of millions depended wasbeing shaped from the irritation of the older men the curiosity of theuninitiated the reserve of the initiated the hurry and preoccupationof everyone and the innumerable committees and commissions of whoseexistence he learned every day he felt that now in  here inpetersburg a vast civil conflict was in preparation the commander inchief of which was a mysterious person he did not know but who wassupposed to be a man of geniussperanski and this movement ofreconstruction of which prince andrew had a vague idea and speranskiits chief promoter began to interest him so keenly that the question ofthe army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in hisconsciousnessprince andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in thehighest and most diverse petersburg circles of the day the reformingparty cordially welcomed and courted him in the first place because hewas reputed to be clever and very well read and secondly because byliberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberalthe party of the old and dissatisfied who censured the innovationsturned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of thereforms simply because he was the son of his father the femininesociety world welcomed him gladly because he was rich distinguished agood match and almost a newcomer with a halo of romance on account ofhis supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife besides this thegeneral opinion of all who had known him previously was that he hadgreatly improved during these last five years having softened and grownmore manly lost his former affectation pride and contemptuous ironyand acquired the serenity that comes with years people talked abouthim were interested in him and wanted to meet himthe day after his interview with count arakcheev prince andrew spentthe evening at count kochubeys he told the count of his interview withsila andreevich kochubey spoke of arakcheev by that nickname with thesame vague irony prince andrew had noticed in the minister of warsanteroommon cher even in this case you cant do without michael mikhaylovichsperanski he manages everything ill speak to him he has promised tocome this eveningwhat has speranski to do with the army regulations asked princeandrewkochubey shook his head smilingly as if surprised at bolkonskissimplicitywe were talking to him about you a few days ago kochubey continuedand about your freed plowmenoh is it you prince who have freed your serfs said an old man ofcatherines day turning contemptuously toward bolkonskiit was a small estate that brought in no profit replied princeandrew trying to extenuate his action so as not to irritate the old manuselesslyafraid of being late said the old man looking at kochubeytheres one thing i dont understand he continued who will plow theland if they are set free it is easy to write laws but difficult torule just the same as nowi ask you countwho will be heads ofthe departments when everybody has to pass examinationsthose who pass the examinations i suppose replied kochubey crossinghis legs and glancing roundwell i have pryanichnikov serving under me a splendid man apriceless man but hes sixty is he to go up for examinationyes thats a difficulty as education is not at all general butcount kochubey did not finish he rose took prince andrew by the armand went to meet a tall bald fair man of about forty with a large openforehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness who was justentering the newcomer wore a blue swallowtail coat with a crosssuspended from his neck and a star on his left breast it was speranskiprince andrew recognized him at once and felt a throb within him ashappens at critical moments of life whether it was from respect envyor anticipation he did not know speranskis whole figure was of apeculiar type that made him easily recognizable in the society in whichprince andrew lived he had never seen anyone who together with awkwardand clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and selfassurance he hadnever seen so resolute yet gentle an expression as that in those halfclosed rather humid eyes or so firm a smile that expressed nothingnor had he heard such a refined smooth soft voice above all he hadnever seen such delicate whiteness of face or handshands which werebroad but very plump soft and white such whiteness and softnessprince andrew had only seen on the faces of soldiers who had been longin hospital this was speranski secretary of state reporter to theemperor and his companion at erfurt where he had more than once met andtalked with napoleonsperanski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as peopleinvoluntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry tospeak he spoke slowly with assurance that he would be listened to andhe looked only at the person with whom he was conversingprince andrew followed speranskis every word and movement withparticular attention as happens to some people especially to men whojudge those near to them severely he always on meeting anyone newespecially anyone whom like speranski he knew by reputationexpectedto discover in him the perfection of human qualitiessperanski told kochubey he was sorry he had been unable to come sooneras he had been detained at the palace he did not say that the emperorhad kept him and prince andrew noticed this affectation of modestywhen kochubey introduced prince andrew speranski slowly turned his eyesto bolkonski with his customary smile and looked at him in silencei am very glad to make your acquaintance i had heard of you aseveryone has he said after a pausekochubey said a few words about the reception arakcheev had givenbolkonski speranski smiled more markedlythe chairman of the committee on army regulations is my good friendmonsieur magnitski he said fully articulating every word andsyllable and if you like i can put you in touch with him he pausedat the full stop i hope you will find him sympathetic and ready to cooperate in promoting all that is reasonablea circle soon formed round speranski and the old man who had talkedabout his subordinate pryanichnikov addressed a question to himprince andrew without joining in the conversation watched every movementof speranskis this man not long since an insignificant divinitystudent who now bolkonski thought held in his handsthose plumpwhite handsthe fate of russia prince andrew was struck by theextraordinarily disdainful composure with which speranski answered theold man he appeared to address condescending words to him from animmeasurable height when the old man began to speak too loud speranskismiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or disadvantage ofwhat pleased the sovereignhaving talked for a little while in the general circle speranski roseand coming up to prince andrew took him along to the other end of theroom it was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself inbolkonskii had no chance to talk with you prince during the animatedconversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me he saidwith a mildly contemptuous smile as if intimating by that smile that heand prince andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whomhe had just been talking this flattered prince andrew i have known ofyou for a long time first from your action with regard to your serfs afirst example of which it is very desirable that there should be moreimitators and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of thechamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new decreeconcerning the ranks allotted to courtiers which is causing so muchgossip and tittletattleno said prince andrew my father did not wish me to take advantageof the privilege i began the service from the lower gradeyour father a man of the last century evidently stands above ourcontemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely reestablishesnatural justicei think however that these condemnations have some ground returnedprince andrew trying to resist speranskis influence of which he beganto be conscious he did not like to agree with him in everything andfelt a wish to contradict though he usually spoke easily and well hefelt a difficulty in expressing himself now while talking withsperanski he was too much absorbed in observing the famous manspersonalitygrounds of personal ambition maybe speranski put in quietlyand of state interest to some extent said prince andrewwhat do you mean asked speranski quietly lowering his eyesi am an admirer of montesquieu replied prince andrew and his ideathat le principe des monarchies est lhonneur me parait incontestablecertains droits et privileges de la noblesse me paraissent etre desmoyens de soutenir ce sentiment  the principle of monarchies is honor seems to me incontestablecertain rights and privileges for the aristocracy appear to me a meansof maintaining that sentimentthe smile vanished from speranskis white face which was much improvedby the change probably prince andrews thought interested himsi vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue  he beganpronouncing french with evident difficulty and speaking even slowerthan in russian but quite calmly if you regard the question from that point of viewsperanski went on to say that honor lhonneur cannot be upheld byprivileges harmful to the service that honor lhonneur is either anegative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a source ofemulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards which recognize ithis arguments were concise simple and clearan institution upholding honor the source of emulation is one similarto the legion dhonneur of the great emperor napoleon not harmful buthelpful to the success of the service but not a class or courtprivilegei do not dispute that but it cannot be denied that court privilegeshave attained the same end returned prince andrew every courtierconsiders himself bound to maintain his position worthilyyet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege prince saidsperanski indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably anargument which was embarrassing for his companion if you will do methe honor of calling on me on wednesday he added i will aftertalking with magnitski let you know what may interest you and shallalso have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with youclosing his eyes he bowed a la francaise without taking leave andtrying to attract as little attention as possible he left the roomduring the first weeks of his stay in petersburg prince andrew felt thewhole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quiteovershadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that cityon returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook fouror five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours the mechanismof life the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhereabsorbed the greater part of his vital energy he did nothing did noteven think or find time to think but only talked and talkedsuccessfully of what he had thought while in the countryhe sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the sameremark on the same day in different circles but he was so busy forwhole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinkingof nothingas he had done on their first meeting at kochubeys speranski produceda strong impression on prince andrew on the wednesday when he receivedhim ttette at his own house and talked to him long andconfidentiallyto bolkonski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificantcreatures and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of thatperfection toward which he strove that he readily believed that insperanski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuousman had speranski sprung from the same class as himself and possessedthe same breeding and traditions bolkonski would soon have discoveredhis weak human unheroic sides but as it was speranskis strange andlogical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because hedid not quite understand him moreover speranski either because heappreciated the others capacity or because he considered it necessaryto win him to his side showed off his dispassionate calm reasonablenessbefore prince andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery whichgoes hand in hand with selfassurance and consists in a tacit assumptionthat ones companion is the only man besides oneself capable ofunderstanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the reasonablenessand profundity of ones own ideasduring their long conversation on wednesday evening speranski more thanonce remarked we regard everything that is above the common level ofrooted custom or with a smile but we want the wolves to be fedand the sheep to be safe or they cannot understand this andall in a way that seemed to say we you and i understand what theyare and who we arethis first long conversation with speranski only strengthened in princeandrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first meetinghe saw in him a remarkable clearthinking man of vast intellect who byhis energy and persistence had attained power which he was using solelyfor the welfare of russia in prince andrews eyes speranski was the manhe would himself have wished to beone who explained all the facts oflife reasonably considered important only what was rational and wascapable of applying the standard of reason to everything everythingseemed so simple and clear in speranskis exposition that prince andrewinvoluntarily agreed with him about everything if he replied andargued it was only because he wished to maintain his independence andnot submit to speranskis opinions entirely everything was right andeverything was as it should be only one thing disconcerted princeandrew this was speranskis cold mirrorlike look which did not allowone to penetrate to his soul and his delicate white hands which princeandrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the hands of those whopossess power this mirrorlike gaze and those delicate hands irritatedprince andrew he knew not why he was unpleasantly struck too by theexcessive contempt for others that he observed in speranski and by thediversity of lines of argument he used to support his opinions he madeuse of every kind of mental device except analogy and passed tooboldly it seemed to prince andrew from one to another now he wouldtake up the position of a practical man and condemn dreamers now thatof a satirist and laugh ironically at his opponents now grow severelylogical or suddenly rise to the realm of metaphysics this lastresource was one he very frequently employed he would transfer aquestion to metaphysical heights pass on to definitions of space timeand thought and having deduced the refutation he needed would againdescend to the level of the original discussionin general the trait of speranskis mentality which struck prince andrewmost was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and authorityof reason it was evident that the thought could never occur to himwhich to prince andrew seemed so natural namely that it is after allimpossible to express all one thinks and that he had never felt thedoubt is not all i think and believe nonsense and it was just thispeculiarity of speranskis mind that particularly attracted princeandrewduring the first period of their acquaintance bolkonski felt apassionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt forbonaparte the fact that speranski was the son of a village priest andthat stupid people might meanly despise him on account of his humbleorigin as in fact many did caused prince andrew to cherish hissentiment for him the more and unconsciously to strengthen iton that first evening bolkonski spent with him having mentioned thecommission for the revision of the code of laws speranski told himsarcastically that the commission had existed for a hundred and fiftyyears had cost millions and had done nothing except that rosenkampfhad stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codesand that is all the state has for the millions it has spent said hewe want to give the senate new juridical powers but we have no lawsthat is why it is a sin for men like you prince not to serve in thesetimesprince andrew said that for that work an education in jurisprudence wasneeded which he did not possessbut nobody possesses it so what would you have it is a vicious circlefrom which we must break a way outa week later prince andrew was a member of the committee on armyregulations andwhat he had not at all expectedwas chairman of asection of the committee for the revision of the laws at speranskisrequest he took the first part of the civil code that was being drawn upand with the aid of the code napoleon and the institutes of justinianhe worked at formulating the section on personal rightsnearly two years before this in  pierre on returning to petersburgafter visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leadingposition among the petersburg freemasons he arranged dining and funerallodge meetings enrolled new members and busied himself uniting variouslodges and acquiring authentic charters he gave money for the erectionof temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of almsin regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular hesupported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded inpetersburghis life meanwhile continued as before with the same infatuations anddissipations he liked to dine and drink well and though he consideredit immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of thebachelor circles in which he movedamid the turmoil of his activities and distractions however pierre atthe end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to restupon it the more masonic ground on which he stood gave way under himat the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him thecloser bound he involuntarily became to the order when he had joinedthe freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidentlysteps onto the smooth surface of a bog when he put his foot down itsank in to make quite sure of the firmness of the ground he put hisother foot down and sank deeper still became stuck in it andinvoluntarily waded kneedeep in the bogjoseph alexeevich was not in petersburghe had of late stood aside fromthe affairs of the petersburg lodges and lived almost entirely inmoscow all the members of the lodges were men pierre knew in ordinarylife and it was difficult for him to regard them merely as brothers infreemasonry and not as prince b or ivan vasilevich d whom he knew insociety mostly as weak and insignificant men under the masonic apronsand insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at which they aimed inordinary life often after collecting alms and reckoning up twenty tothirty rubles received for the most part in promises from a dozenmembers of whom half were as well able to pay as himself pierreremembered the masonic vow in which each brother promised to devote allhis belongings to his neighbor and doubts on which he tried not todwell arose in his soulhe divided the brothers he knew into four categories in the first heput those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodgesor in human affairs but were exclusively occupied with the mysticalscience of the order with questions of the threefold designation ofgod the three primordial elementssulphur mercury and saltor themeaning of the square and all the various figures of the temple ofsolomon pierre respected this class of brothers to which the elder oneschiefly belonged including pierre thought joseph alexeevich himselfbut he did not share their interests his heart was not in the mysticalaspect of freemasonryin the second category pierre reckoned himself and others like himseeking and vacillating who had not yet found in freemasonry a straightand comprehensible path but hoped to do soin the third category he included those brothers the majority who sawnothing in freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies and prizedthe strict performance of these forms without troubling about theirpurport or significance such were willarski and even the grand masterof the principal lodgefinally to the fourth category also a great many brothers belongedparticularly those who had lately joined these according to pierresobservations were men who had no belief in anything nor desire foranything but joined the freemasons merely to associate with the wealthyyoung brothers who were influential through their connections or rankand of whom there were very many in the lodgepierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing freemasonryat any rate as he saw it here sometimes seemed to him based merely onexternals he did not think of doubting freemasonry itself butsuspected that russian masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated fromits original principles and so toward the end of the year he wentabroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the orderin the summer of  pierre returned to petersburg our freemasons knewfrom correspondence with those abroad that bezukhov had obtained theconfidence of many highly placed persons had been initiated into manymysteries had been raised to a higher grade and was bringing back withhim much that might conduce to the advantage of the masonic cause inrussia the petersburg freemasons all came to see him tried toingratiate themselves with him and it seemed to them all that he waspreparing something for them and concealing ita solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened atwhich pierre promised to communicate to the petersburg brothers what hehad to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their order themeeting was a full one after the usual ceremonies pierre rose and beganhis addressdear brothers he began blushing and stammering with a writtenspeech in his hand it is not sufficient to observe our mysteries inthe seclusion of our lodgewe must actact we are drowsing but wemust act pierre raised his notebook and began to readfor the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph ofvirtue he read we must cleanse men from prejudice diffuseprinciples in harmony with the spirit of the times undertake theeducation of the young unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with thewisest men boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions infidelity andfolly and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by unityof purpose and possessed of authority and powerto attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over viceand must endeavor to secure that the honest man may even in this worldreceive a lasting reward for his virtue but in these great endeavors weare gravely hampered by the political institutions of today what is tobe done in these circumstances to favor revolutions overthroweverything repel force by force no we are very far from thatevery violent reform deserves censure for it quite fails to remedy evilwhile men remain what they are and also because wisdom needs noviolencethe whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of preparingmen of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of convictionaimingat the punishment of vice and folly and patronizing talent and virtueraising worthy men from the dust and attaching them to our brotherhoodonly then will our order have the power unobtrusively to bind the handsof the protectors of disorder and to control them without their beingaware of it in a word we must found a form of government holdinguniversal sway which should be diffused over the whole world withoutdestroying the bonds of citizenship and beside which all othergovernments can continue in their customary course and do everythingexcept what impedes the great aim of our order which is to obtain forvirtue the victory over vice this aim was that of christianity itselfit taught men to be wise and good and for their own benefit to followthe example and instruction of the best and wisest menat that time when everything was plunged in darkness preaching alonewas of course sufficient the novelty of truth endowed her with specialstrength but now we need much more powerful methods it is nownecessary that man governed by his senses should find in virtue acharm palpable to those senses it is impossible to eradicate thepassions but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim and it istherefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his passionswithin the limits of virtue our order should provide means to that endas soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state eachof them again training two others and all being closely unitedeverything will be possible for our order which has already in secretaccomplished much for the welfare of mankindthis speech not only made a strong impression but created excitement inthe lodge the majority of the brothers seeing in it dangerous designsof illuminism  met it with a coldness that surprised pierre the grandmaster began answering him and pierre began developing his views withmore and more warmth it was long since there had been so stormy ameeting parties were formed some accusing pierre of illuminism otherssupporting him at that meeting he was struck for the first time by theendless variety of mens minds which prevents a truth from everpresenting itself identically to two persons even those members whoseemed to be on his side understood him in their own way withlimitations and alterations he could not agree to as what he alwayswanted most was to convey his thought to others just as he himselfunderstood it the illuminati sought to substitute republican for monarchicalinstitutionsat the end of the meeting the grand master with irony and illwillreproved bezukhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtuealone but also a love of strife that had moved him in the disputepierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal wouldbe accepted he was told that it would not and without waiting for theusual formalities he left the lodge and went homeagain pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded for threedays after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa athome receiving no one and going nowhereit was just then that he received a letter from his wife who imploredhim to see her telling him how grieved she was about him and how shewished to devote her whole life to himat the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she wouldreturn to petersburg from abroadfollowing this letter one of the masonic brothers whom pierre respectedless than the others forced his way in to see him and turning theconversation upon pierres matrimonial affairs by way of fraternaladvice expressed the opinion that his severity to his wife was wrong andthat he was neglecting one of the first rules of freemasonry by notforgiving the penitentat the same time his motherinlaw prince vasilis wife sent to himimploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a mostimportant matter pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him andthat they wanted to reunite him with his wife and in the mood he thenwas this was not even unpleasant to him nothing mattered to himnothing in life seemed to him of much importance and under theinfluence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither hisliberty nor his resolution to punish his wifeno one is right and no one is to blame so she too is not to blame hethoughtif he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife itwas only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to takeany step had his wife come to him he would not have turned her awaycompared to what preoccupied him was it not a matter of indifferencewhether he lived with his wife or notwithout replying either to his wife or his motherinlaw pierre lateone night prepared for a journey and started for moscow to see josephalexeevich this is what he noted in his diarymoscow th novemberi have just returned from my benefactor and hasten to write down what ihave experienced joseph alexeevich is living poorly and has for threeyears been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder no one hasever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint from morning tilllate at night except when he eats his very plain food he is working atscience he received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed onwhich he lay i made the sign of the knights of the east and ofjerusalem and he responded in the same manner asking me with a mildsmile what i had learned and gained in the prussian and scottish lodgesi told him everything as best i could and told him what i had proposedto our petersburg lodge of the bad reception i had encountered and ofmy rupture with the brothers joseph alexeevich having remained silentand thoughtful for a good while told me his view of the matter whichat once lit up for me my whole past and the future path i should followhe surprised me by asking whether i remembered the threefold aim of theorder  the preservation and study of the mystery  thepurification and reformation of oneself for its reception and  theimprovement of the human race by striving for such purification whichis the principal aim of these three certainly selfreformation andselfpurification only to this aim can we always strive independentlyof circumstances but at the same time just this aim demands thegreatest efforts of us and so led astray by pride losing sight ofthis aim we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in ourimpurity we are unworthy to receive or seek the reformation of thehuman race while ourselves setting an example of baseness andprofligacy illuminism is not a pure doctrine just because it isattracted by social activity and puffed up by pride on this groundjoseph alexeevich condemned my speech and my whole activity and in thedepth of my soul i agreed with him talking of my family affairs he saidto me the chief duty of a true mason as i have told you lies inperfecting himself we often think that by removing all the difficultiesof our life we shall more quickly reach our aim but on the contrary mydear sir it is only in the midst of worldly cares that we can attainour three chief aims  selfknowledgefor man can only know himselfby comparison  selfperfecting which can only be attained byconflict and  the attainment of the chief virtuelove of deathonly the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop ourinnate love of death or of rebirth to a new life these words are allthe more remarkable because in spite of his great physical sufferingsjoseph alexeevich is never weary of life though he loves death forwhichin spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner manhe doesnot yet feel himself sufficiently prepared my benefactor then explainedto me fully the meaning of the great square of creation and pointed outto me that the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything headvised me not to avoid intercourse with the petersburg brothers but totake up only secondgrade posts in the lodge to try while divertingthe brothers from pride to turn them toward the true path selfknowledge and selfperfecting besides this he advised me for myselfpersonally above all to keep a watch over myself and to that end hegave me a notebook the one i am now writing in and in which i will infuture note down all my actionspetersburg rd novemberi am again living with my wife my motherinlaw came to me in tears andsaid that helene was here and that she implored me to hear her that shewas innocent and unhappy at my desertion and much more i knew that ifi once let myself see her i should not have strength to go on refusingwhat she wanted in my perplexity i did not know whose aid and advice toseek had my benefactor been here he would have told me what to do iwent to my room and reread joseph alexeevichs letters and recalled myconversations with him and deduced from it all that i ought not torefuse a supplicant and ought to reach a helping hand to everyoneespecially to one so closely bound to meand that i must bear my crossbut if i forgive her for the sake of doing right then let union withher have only a spiritual aim that is what i decided and what i wroteto joseph alexeevich i told my wife that i begged her to forget thepast to forgive me whatever wrong i may have done her and that i hadnothing to forgive it gave me joy to tell her this she need not knowhow hard it was for me to see her again i have settled on the upperfloor of this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling ofregenerationat that time as always happens the highest society that met at courtand at the grand balls was divided into several circles each with itsown particular tone the largest of these was the french circle of thenapoleonic alliance the circle of count rumyantsev and caulaincourt inthis group helene as soon as she had settled in petersburg with herhusband took a very prominent place she was visited by the members ofthe french embassy and by many belonging to that circle and noted fortheir intellect and polished mannershelene had been at erfurt during the famous meeting of the emperors andhad brought from there these connections with the napoleonicnotabilities at erfurt her success had been brilliant napoleon himselfhad noticed her in the theater and said of her cest un superbeanimal  her success as a beautiful and elegant woman did not surprisepierre for she had become even handsomer than before what did surprisehim was that during these last two years his wife had succeeded ingaining the reputation d une femme charmante aussi spirituelle quebelle  the distinguished prince de ligne wrote her eightpageletters bilibin saved up his epigrams to produce them in countessbezukhovas presence to be received in the countess bezukhovas salonwas regarded as a diploma of intellect young men read books beforeattending helenes evenings to have something to say in her salon andsecretaries of the embassy and even ambassadors confided diplomaticsecrets to her so that in a way helene was a power pierre who knewshe was very stupid sometimes attended with a strange feeling ofperplexity and fear her evenings and dinner parties where politicspoetry and philosophy were discussed at these parties his feelingswere like those of a conjuror who always expects his trick to be foundout at any moment but whether because stupidity was just what wasneeded to run such a salon or because those who were deceived foundpleasure in the deception at any rate it remained unexposed and helenebezukhovas reputation as a lovely and clever woman became so firmlyestablished that she could say the emptiest and stupidest things andeverybody would go into raptures over every word of hers and look for aprofound meaning in it of which she herself had no conception thats a superb animal  of a charming woman as witty as she is lovelypierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman he wasthat absentminded crank a grand seigneur husband who was in no onesway and far from spoiling the high tone and general impression of thedrawing room he served by the contrast he presented to her as anadvantageous background to his elegant and tactful wife pierre duringthe last two years as a result of his continual absorption in abstractinterests and his sincere contempt for all else had acquired in hiswifes circle which did not interest him that air of unconcernindifference and benevolence toward all which cannot be acquiredartificially and therefore inspires involuntary respect he entered hiswifes drawing room as one enters a theater was acquainted witheverybody equally pleased to see everyone and equally indifferent tothem all sometimes he joined in a conversation which interested himand regardless of whether any gentlemen of the embassy were presentor not lispingly expressed his views which were sometimes not at allin accord with the accepted tone of the moment but the general opinionconcerning the queer husband of the most distinguished woman inpetersburg was so well established that no one took his freaksseriouslyamong the many young men who frequented her house every day borisdrubetskoy who had already achieved great success in the service wasthe most intimate friend of the bezukhov household since helenes returnfrom erfurt helene spoke of him as mon page and treated him like achild her smile for him was the same as for everybody but sometimesthat smile made pierre uncomfortable toward him boris behaved with aparticularly dignified and sad deference this shade of deference alsodisturbed pierre he had suffered so painfully three years before fromthe mortification to which his wife had subjected him that he nowprotected himself from the danger of its repetition first by not beinga husband to his wife and secondly by not allowing himself to suspectno now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally renouncedher former infatuations he told himself there has never been aninstance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs of the hearta statement which though gathered from an unknown source he believedimplicitly yet strange to say boris presence in his wifes drawingroom and he was almost always there had a physical effect upon pierreit constricted his limbs and destroyed the unconsciousness and freedomof his movementswhat a strange antipathy thought pierre yet i used to like him verymuchin the eyes of the world pierre was a great gentleman the rather blindand absurd husband of a distinguished wife a clever crank who didnothing but harmed nobody and was a firstrate goodnatured fellow buta complex and difficult process of internal development was taking placeall this time in pierres soul revealing much to him and causing himmany spiritual doubts and joyspierre went on with his diary and this is what he wrote in it duringthat timeth novembergot up at eight read the scriptures then went to my duties by josephalexeevichs advice pierre had entered the service of the state andserved on one of the committees returned home for dinner and dinedalonethe countess had many visitors i do not like i ate and drankmoderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the brothersin the evening i went down to the countess and told a funny story aboutb and only remembered that i ought not to have done so when everybodylaughed loudly at iti am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind great god help me towalk

scripturesbut without proper feeling brother urusov came and we talked aboutworldly vanities he told me of the emperors new projects i began tocriticize them but remembered my rules and my benefactors wordsthata true freemason should be a zealous worker for the state when his aidis required and a quiet onlooker when not called on to assist my tongueis my enemy brothers g v and o visited me and we had a preliminarytalk about the reception of a new brother they laid on me the duty ofrhetor i feel myself weak and unworthy then our talk turned to theinterpretation of the seven pillars and steps of the temple the sevensciences the seven virtues the seven vices and the seven gifts of theholy spirit brother o was very eloquent in the evening the admissiontook place the new decoration of the premises contributed much to themagnificence of the spectacle it was boris drubetskoy who was admittedi nominated him and was the rhetor a strange feeling agitated me allthe time i was alone with him in the dark chamber i caught myselfharboring a feeling of hatred toward him which i vainly tried toovercome that is why i should really like to save him from evil andlead him into the path of truth but evil thoughts of him did not leaveme it seemed to me that his object in entering the brotherhood wasmerely to be intimate and in favor with members of our lodge apart fromthe fact that he had asked me several times whether n and s weremembers of our lodge a question to which i could not reply and thataccording to my observation he is incapable of feeling respect for ourholy order and is too preoccupied and satisfied with the outer man todesire spiritual improvement i had no cause to doubt him but he seemedto me insincere and all the time i stood alone with him in the darktemple it seemed to me that he was smiling contemptuously at my wordsand i wished really to stab his bare breast with the sword i held to iti could not be eloquent nor could i frankly mention my doubts to thebrothers and to the grand master great architect of nature help me tofind the true path out of the labyrinth of liesafter this three pages were left blank in the diary and then thefollowing was writteni have had a long and instructive talk alone with brother v whoadvised me to hold fast by brother a though i am unworthy much wasrevealed to me adonai is the name of the creator of the world

spiritual essencechrist the holy spirit himrd decemberawoke late read the scriptures but was apathetic afterwards went andpaced up and down the large hall i wished to meditate but instead myimagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago when dolokhovmeeting me in moscow after our duel said he hoped i was enjoyingperfect peace of mind in spite of my wifes absence at the time i gavehim no answer now i recalled every detail of that meeting and in mymind gave him the most malevolent and bitter replies i recollectedmyself and drove away that thought only when i found myself glowing withanger but i did not sufficiently repent afterwards boris drubetskoycame and began relating various adventures his coming vexed me from thefirst and i said something disagreeable to him he replied i flared upand said much that was unpleasant and even rude to him he becamesilent and i recollected myself only when it was too late my god icannot get on with him at all the cause of this is my egotism i setmyself above him and so become much worse than he for he is lenient tomy rudeness while i on the contrary nourish contempt for him o godgrant that in his presence i may rather see my own vileness and behaveso that he too may benefit after dinner i fell asleep and as i wasdrowsing off i clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear thy dayi dreamed that i was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded bydogs but i went on undismayed suddenly a smallish dog seized my leftthigh with its teeth and would not let go i began to throttle it withmy hands scarcely had i torn it off before another a bigger one beganbiting me i lifted it up but the higher i lifted it the bigger andheavier it grew and suddenly brother a came and taking my arm led meto a building to enter which we had to pass along a narrow plank istepped on it but it bent and gave way and i began to clamber up afence which i could scarcely reach with my hands after much effort idragged myself up so that my leg hung down on one side and my body onthe other i looked round and saw brother a standing on the fence andpointing me to a broad avenue and garden and in the garden was a largeand beautiful building i woke up o lord great architect of naturehelp me to tear from myself these dogsmy passions especially the lastwhich unites in itself the strength of all the former ones and aid meto enter that temple of virtue to a vision of which i attained in mydreamth decemberi dreamed that joseph alexeevich was sitting in my house and that i wasvery glad and wished to entertain him it seemed as if i chatteredincessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this couldnot please him and i wished to come close to him and embrace him butas soon as i drew near i saw that his face had changed and grown youngand he was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our orderbut so softly that i could not hear it then it seemed that we all leftthe room and something strange happened we were sitting or lying on thefloor he was telling me something and i wished to show him mysensibility and not listening to what he was saying i began picturingto myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of god sanctifyingme and tears came into my eyes and i was glad he noticed this but helooked at me with vexation and jumped up breaking off his remarks ifelt abashed and asked whether what he had been saying did not concernme but he did not reply gave me a kind look and then we suddenlyfound ourselves in my bedroom where there is a double bed he lay downon the edge of it and i burned with longing to caress him and lie downtoo and he said tell me frankly what is your chief temptation do youknow it i think you know it already abashed by this question ireplied that sloth was my chief temptation he shook his headincredulously and even more abashed i said that though i was livingwith my wife as he advised i was not living with her as her husband tothis he replied that one should not deprive a wife of ones embraces andgave me to understand that that was my duty but i replied that i shouldbe ashamed to do it and suddenly everything vanished and i awoke andfound in my mind the text from the gospel the life was the light ofmen and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended itnot joseph alexeevichs face had looked young and bright that day ireceived a letter from my benefactor in which he wrote about conjugaldutiesth decemberi had a dream from which i awoke with a throbbing heart i saw that iwas in moscow in my house in the big sitting room and josephalexeevich came in from the drawing room i seemed to know at once thatthe process of regeneration had already taken place in him and i rushedto meet him i embraced him and kissed his hands and he said hastthou noticed that my face is different i looked at him still holdinghim in my arms and saw that his face was young but that he had no hairon his head and his features were quite changed and i said i shouldhave known you had i met you by chance and i thought to myself am itelling the truth and suddenly i saw him lying like a dead body thenhe gradually recovered and went with me into my study carrying a largebook of sheets of drawing paper i said i drew that and he answeredby bowing his head i opened the book and on all the pages there wereexcellent drawings and in my dream i knew that these drawingsrepresented the love adventures of the soul with its beloved and on itspages i saw a beautiful representation of a maiden in transparentgarments and with a transparent body flying up to the clouds and iseemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a representationof the song of songs and looking at those drawings i dreamed i feltthat i was doing wrong but could not tear myself away from them lordhelp me my god if thy forsaking me is thy doing thy will be done butif i am myself the cause teach me what i should do i shall perish ofmy debauchery if thou utterly desertest methe rostovs monetary affairs had not improved during the two years theyhad spent in the countrythough nicholas rostov had kept firmly to his resolution and was stillserving modestly in an obscure regiment spending comparatively littlethe way of life at otradnoemitenkas management of affairs inparticularwas such that the debts inevitably increased every year theonly resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to applyfor an official post so he had come to petersburg to look for one andalso as he said to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last timesoon after their arrival in petersburg berg proposed to vera and wasacceptedthough in moscow the rostovs belonged to the best society withoutthemselves giving it a thought yet in petersburg their circle ofacquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one in petersburg they wereprovincials and the very people they had entertained in moscow withoutinquiring to what set they belonged here looked down on themthe rostovs lived in the same hospitable way in petersburg as in moscowand the most diverse people met at their suppers country neighbors fromotradnoe impoverished old squires and their daughters peronskaya amaid of honor pierre bezukhov and the son of their district postmasterwho had obtained a post in petersburg among the men who very soonbecame frequent visitors at the rostovs house in petersburg were borispierre whom the count had met in the street and dragged home with himand berg who spent whole days at the rostovs and paid the eldestdaughter countess vera the attentions a young man pays when he intendsto proposenot in vain had berg shown everybody his right hand wounded atausterlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left henarrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air thateveryone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed and he hadobtained two decorations for austerlitzin the finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself he had pickedup the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aidedecamp standing nearthe commanderinchief and had taken it to his commander just as he haddone after austerlitz he related this occurrence at such length and soinsistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to dothis and he received two decorations for the finnish war also in he was a captain in the guards wore medals and held some speciallucrative posts in petersburgthough some skeptics smiled when told of bergs merits it could not bedenied that he was a painstaking and brave officer on excellent termswith his superiors and a moral young man with a brilliant career beforehim and an assured position in societyfour years before meeting a german comrade in the stalls of a moscowtheater berg had pointed out vera rostova to him and had said ingerman das soll mein weib werden  and from that moment had made uphis mind to marry her now in petersburg having considered the rostovsposition and his own he decided that the time had come to propose that girl shall be my wifebergs proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was notflattering to him at first it seemed strange that the son of an obscurelivonian gentleman should propose marriage to a countess rostova butbergs chief characteristic was such a naive and good natured egotismthat the rostovs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thingsince he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good indeedexcellent moreover the rostovs affairs were seriously embarrassed asthe suitor could not but know and above all vera was twentyfour hadbeen taken out everywhere and though she was certainly goodlooking andsensible no one up to now had proposed to her so they gave theirconsentyou see said berg to his comrade whom he called friend onlybecause he knew that everyone has friends you see i have consideredit all and should not marry if i had not thought it all out or if itwere in any way unsuitable but on the contrary my papa and mamma arenow provided fori have arranged that rent for them in the balticprovincesand i can live in petersburg on my pay and with her fortuneand my good management we can get along nicely i am not marrying formoneyi consider that dishonorablebut a wife should bring her shareand a husband his i have my position in the service she hasconnections and some means in our times that is worth something isntit but above all she is a handsome estimable girl and she lovesmeberg blushed and smiledand i love her because her character is sensible and very good nowthe other sister though they are the same family is quite differentan unpleasant character and has not the same intelligence she is soyou know unpleasant but my fiancee well you will be cominghe was going to say to dine but changed his mind and said to taketea with us and quickly doubling up his tongue he blew a small roundring of tobacco smoke perfectly embodying his dream of happinessafter the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by bergsproposal the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times tookpossession of the family but the rejoicing was external and insincerein the familys feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness andconstraint was evident as if they were ashamed of not having loved verasufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands the oldcount felt this most he would probably have been unable to state thecause of his embarrassment but it resulted from the state of hisaffairs he did not know at all how much he had what his debts amountedto or what dowry he could give vera when his daughters were born hehad assigned to each of them for her dowry an estate with threehundred serfs but one of these estates had already been sold and theother was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it wouldhave to be sold so that it was impossible to give it to vera nor hadhe any moneyberg had already been engaged a month and only a week remained beforethe wedding but the count had not yet decided in his own mind thequestion of the dowry nor spoken to his wife about it at one time thecount thought of giving her the ryazan estate or of selling a forest atanother time of borrowing money on a note of hand a few days before thewedding berg entered the counts study early one morning and with apleasant smile respectfully asked his future fatherinlaw to let himknow what veras dowry would be the count was so disconcerted by thislongforeseen inquiry that without consideration he gave the first replythat came into his head i like your being businesslike about it ilike it you shall be satisfiedand patting berg on the shoulder he got up wishing to end theconversation but berg smiling pleasantly explained that if he did notknow for certain how much vera would have and did not receive at leastpart of the dowry in advance he would have to break matters offbecause consider countif i allowed myself to marry now withouthaving definite means to maintain my wife i should be acting badlythe conversation ended by the count who wished to be generous and toavoid further importunity saying that he would give a note of hand foreighty thousand rubles berg smiled meekly kissed the count on theshoulder and said that he was very grateful but that it was impossiblefor him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand inready money or at least twenty thousand count he added and then anote of hand for only sixty thousandyes yes all right said the count hurriedly only excuse me mydear fellow ill give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for eightythousand as well yes yes kiss menatasha was sixteen and it was the year  the very year to which shehad counted on her fingers with boris after they had kissed four yearsago since then she had not seen him before sonya and her mother ifboris happened to be mentioned she spoke quite freely of that episodeas of some childish longforgotten matter that was not worthmentioning but in the secret depths of her soul the question whetherher engagement to boris was a jest or an important binding promisetormented hersince boris left moscow in  to join the army he had not seen therostovs he had been in moscow several times and had passed nearotradnoe but had never been to see themsometimes it occurred to natasha that he did not wish to see her andthis conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spokeof himnowadays old friends are not remembered the countess would say whenboris was mentionedanna mikhaylovna also had of late visited them less frequently seemedto hold herself with particular dignity and always spoke rapturouslyand gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career onwhich he had entered when the rostovs came to petersburg boris calledon themhe drove to their house in some agitation the memory of natasha was hismost poetic recollection but he went with the firm intention of lettingher and her parents feel that the childish relations between himself andnatasha could not be binding either on her or on him he had a brilliantposition in society thanks to his intimacy with countess bezukhova abrilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage of animportant personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed and he wasbeginning to make plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses inpetersburg plans which might very easily be realized when he enteredthe rostovs drawing room natasha was in her own room when she heard ofhis arrival she almost ran into the drawing room flushed and beamingwith a more than cordial smileboris remembered natasha in a short dress with dark eyes shining fromunder her curls and boisterous childish laughter as he had known herfour years before and so he was taken aback when quite a differentnatasha entered and his face expressed rapturous astonishment thisexpression on his face pleased natashawell do you recognize your little madcap playmate asked thecountessboris kissed natashas hand and said that he was astonished at thechange in herhow handsome you have growni should think so replied natashas laughing eyesand is papa older she askednatasha sat down and without joining in boris conversation with thecountess silently and minutely studied her childhoods suitor he feltthe weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced at heroccasionallyboris uniform spurs tie and the way his hair was brushed were allcomme il faut and in the latest fashion this natasha noticed at oncehe sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess arrangingwith his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left handlike a skin and he spoke with a particularly refined compression of hislips about the amusements of the highest petersburg society recallingwith mild irony old times in moscow and moscow acquaintances it was notaccidentally natasha felt that he alluded when speaking of thehighest aristocracy to an ambassadors ball he had attended and toinvitations he had received from nn and ssall this time natasha sat silent glancing up at him from under herbrows this gaze disturbed and confused boris more and more he lookedround more frequently toward her and broke off in what he was sayinghe did not stay more than ten minutes then rose and took his leave thesame inquisitive challenging and rather mocking eyes still looked athim after his first visit boris said to himself that natasha attractedhim just as much as ever but that he must not yield to that feelingbecause to marry her a girl almost without fortune would mean ruin tohis career while to renew their former relations without intending tomarry her would be dishonorable boris made up his mind to avoid meetingnatasha but despite that resolution he called again a few days laterand began calling often and spending whole days at the rostovs itseemed to him that he ought to have an explanation with natasha and tellher that the old times must be forgotten that in spite of everythingshe could not be his wife that he had no means and they would neverlet her marry him but he failed to do so and felt awkward aboutentering on such an explanation from day to day he became more and moreentangled it seemed to her mother and sonya that natasha was in lovewith boris as of old she sang him his favorite songs showed him heralbum making him write in it did not allow him to allude to the pastletting it be understood how delightful was the present and every dayhe went away in a fog without having said what he meant to and notknowing what he was doing or why he came or how it would all end heleft off visiting helene and received reproachful notes from her everyday and yet he continued to spend whole days with the rostovsone night when the old countess in nightcap and dressing jacketwithout her false curls and with her poor little knob of hair showingunder her white cotton cap knelt sighing and groaning on a rug andbowing to the ground in prayer her door creaked and natasha also in adressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair incurlpapers ran in the countessher prayerful mood dispelledlookedround and frowned she was finishing her last prayer can it be thatthis couch will be my grave natasha flushed and eager seeing hermother in prayer suddenly checked her rush half sat down andunconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself seeing that hermother was still praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and rapidlyslipping one little foot against the other pushed off her slippers andjumped onto the bed the countess had feared might become her grave thiscouch was high with a feather bed and five pillows each smaller thanthe one below natasha jumped on it sank into the feather bed rolledover to the wall and began snuggling up the bedclothes as she settleddown raising her knees to her chin kicking out and laughing almostinaudibly now covering herself up head and all and now peeping at hermother the countess finished her prayers and came to the bed with astern face but seeing that natashas head was covered she smiled inher kind weak waynow then now then said shemamma can we have a talk yes said natasha now just one on yourthroat and another thatll do and seizing her mother round theneck she kissed her on the throat in her behavior to her mothernatasha seemed rough but she was so sensitive and tactful that howevershe clasped her mother she always managed to do it without hurting heror making her feel uncomfortable or displeasedwell what is it tonight said the mother having

had still to call at the taurida gardensperonskaya was quite ready in spite of her age and plainness she hadgone through the same process as the rostovs but with less flurryforto her it was a matter of routine her ugly old body was washedperfumed and powdered in just the same way she had washed behind herears just as carefully and when she entered her drawing room in heryellow dress wearing her badge as maid of honor her old ladys maidwas as full of rapturous admiration as the rostovs servants had beenshe praised the rostovs toilets they praised her taste and toilet andat eleven oclock careful of their coiffures and dresses they settledthemselves in their carriages and drove offnatasha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not oncehad time to think of what lay before herin the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage shefor the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there atthe ball in those brightly lighted roomswith music flowers dancesthe emperor and all the brilliant young people of petersburg theprospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true soout of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness of thecarriage she understood all that awaited her only when after steppingover the red baize at the entrance she entered the hall took off herfur cloak and beside sonya and in front of her mother mounted thebrightly illuminated stairs between the flowers only then did sheremember how she must behave at a ball and tried to assume the majesticair she considered indispensable for a girl on such an occasion butfortunately for her she felt her eyes growing misty she saw nothingclearly her pulse beat a hundred to the minute and the blood throbbedat her heart she could not assume that pose which would have made herridiculous and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and tryingwith all her might to conceal it and this was the very attitude thatbecame her best before and behind them other visitors were enteringalso talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses the mirrors on thelanding reflected ladies in white paleblue and pink dresses withdiamonds and pearls on their bare necks and armsnatasha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her reflectionfrom the others all was blended into one brilliant procession onentering the ballroom the regular hum of voices footsteps andgreetings deafened natasha and the light and glitter dazzled her stillmore the host and hostess who had already been standing at the doorfor half an hour repeating the same words to the various arrivalscharme de vous voir  greeted the rostovs and peronskaya in the samemanner delighted to see youthe two girls in their white dresses each with a rose in her blackhair both curtsied in the same way but the hostess eye involuntarilyrested longer on the slim natasha she looked at her and gave her alonea special smile in addition to her usual smile as hostess looking ather she may have recalled the golden irrecoverable days of her owngirlhood and her own first ball the host also followed natasha with hiseyes and asked the count which was his daughtercharming said he kissing the tips of his fingersin the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting theemperor the countess took up a position in one of the front rows ofthat crowd natasha heard and felt that several people were asking abouther and looking at her she realized that those noticing her liked herand this observation helped to calm herthere are some like ourselves and some worse she thoughtperonskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important people atthe ballthat is the dutch ambassador do you see that grayhaired man shesaid indicating an old man with a profusion of silvergray curly hairwho was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he saidah here she is the queen of petersburg countess bezukhova saidperonskaya indicating helene who had just entered how lovely she isquite equal to marya antonovna see how the men young and old paycourt to her beautiful and clever they say princeis quite madabout her but see those two though not goodlooking are even morerun aftershe pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very plaindaughtershe is a splendid match a millionairess said peronskaya and lookhere come her suitorsthat is bezukhovas brother anatole kuragin she said indicating ahandsome officer of the horse guards who passed by them with head erectlooking at something over the heads of the ladies hes handsome isnthe i hear they will marry him to

as if he were a king all the samethe french are charming very charming no one more charming in societyah here she is yes she is still the most beautiful of them all ourmarya antonovna and how simply she is dressed lovely and that stoutone in spectacles is the universal freemason she went on indicatingpierre put him beside his wife and he looks a regular buffoonpierre swaying his stout body advanced making way through the crowdand nodding to right and left as casually and goodnaturedly as if hewere passing through a crowd at a fair he pushed through evidentlylooking for someonenatasha looked joyfully at the familiar face of pierre the buffoonas peronskaya had called him and knew he was looking for them and forher in particular he had promised to be at the ball and introducepartners to herbut before he reached them pierre stopped beside a very handsome darkman of middle height and in a white uniform who stood by a windowtalking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon natasha at oncerecognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform it wasbolkonski who seemed to her to have grown much younger happier andbetterlookingtheres someone else we knowbolkonski do you see mamma saidnatasha pointing out prince andrew you remember he stayed a nightwith us at otradnoeoh you know him said peronskaya i cant bear him il fait apresent la pluie et le beau temps  hes too proud for anything takesafter his father and hes hand in glove with speranski writing someproject or other just look how he treats the ladies theres onetalking to him and he has turned away she said pointing at him idgive it to him if he treated me as he does those ladies he is all the rage just nowsuddenly everybody stirred began talking and pressed forward and thenback and between the two rows which separated the emperor entered tothe sounds of music that had immediately struck up behind him walkedhis host and hostess he walked in rapidly bowing to right and left asif anxious to get the first moments of the reception over the bandplayed the polonaise in vogue at that time on account of the words thathad been set to it beginning alexander elisaveta all our hearts youravish quite the emperor passed on to the drawing room the crowdmade a rush for the doors and several persons with excited faceshurried there and back again then the crowd hastily retired from thedrawingroom door at which the emperor reappeared talking to thehostess a young man looking distraught pounced down on the ladiesasking them to move aside some ladies with faces betraying completeforgetfulness of all the rules of decorum pushed forward to thedetriment of their toilets the men began to choose partners and taketheir places for the polonaiseeveryone moved back and the emperor came smiling out of the drawingroom leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the musicthe host followed with marya antonovna naryshkina then cameambassadors ministers and various generals whom peronskaya diligentlynamed more than half the ladies already had partners and were takingup or preparing to take up their positions for the polonaise natashafelt that she would be left with her mother and sonya among a minorityof women who crowded near the wall not having been invited to danceshe stood with her slender arms hanging down her scarcely defined bosomrising and falling regularly and with bated breath and glitteringfrightened eyes gazed straight before her evidently prepared for theheight of joy or misery she was not concerned about the emperor or anyof those great people whom peronskaya was pointing outshe had but onethought is it possible no one will ask me that i shall not be amongthe first to dance is it possible that not one of all these men willnotice me they do not even seem to see me or if they do they look asif they were saying ah shes not the one im after so its not worthlooking at her no its impossible she thought they must know howi long to dance how splendidly i dance and how they would enjoydancing with methe strains of the polonaise which had continued for a considerabletime had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to natashas ears shewanted to cry peronskaya had left them the count was at the other endof the room she and the countess and sonya were standing by themselvesas in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers with no oneinterested in them and not wanted by anyone prince andrew with a ladypassed by evidently not recognizing them the handsome anatole wassmilingly talking to a partner on his arm and looked at natasha as onelooks at a wall boris passed them twice and each time turned away bergand his wife who were not dancing came up to themthis family gathering seemed humiliating to natashaas if there werenowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball she did notlisten to or look at vera who was telling her something about her owngreen dressat last the emperor stopped beside his last partner he had danced withthree and the music ceased a worried aidedecamp ran up to therostovs requesting them to stand farther back though as it was theywere already close to the wall and from the gallery resounded thedistinct precise enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz the emperorlooked smilingly down the room a minute passed but no one had yet begundancing an aidedecamp the master of ceremonies went up to countessbezukhova and asked her to dance she smilingly raised her hand and laidit on his shoulder without looking at him the aidedecamp an adept inhis art grasping his partner firmly round her waist with confidentdeliberation started smoothly gliding first round the edge of thecircle then at the corner of the room he caught helenes left hand andturned her the only sound audible apart from the everquickeningmusic being the rhythmic click of the spurs on his rapid agile feetwhile at every third beat his partners velvet dress spread out andseemed to flash as she whirled round natasha gazed at them and wasready to cry because it was not she who was dancing that first turn ofthe waltzprince andrew in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel wearingstockings and dancing shoes stood looking animated and bright in thefront row of the circle not far from the rostovs baron firhoff wastalking to him about the first sitting of the council of state to beheld next day prince andrew as one closely connected with speranskiand participating in the work of the legislative commission could givereliable information about that sitting concerning which various rumorswere current but not listening to what firhoff was saying he wasgazing now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance whohad not yet gathered courage to enter the circleprince andrew was watching these men abashed by the emperors presenceand the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to dancepierre came up to him and caught him by the armyou always dance i have a protegee the young rostova here ask herhe saidwhere is she asked bolkonski excuse me he added turning to thebaron we will finish this conversation elsewhereat a ball one mustdance he stepped forward in the direction pierre indicated thedespairing dejected expression of natashas face caught his eye herecognized her guessed her feelings saw that it was her debutremembered her conversation at the window and with an expression ofpleasure on his face approached countess rostovaallow me to introduce you to my daughter said the countess withheightened colori have the pleasure of being already acquainted if the countessremembers me said prince andrew with a low and courteous bow quitebelying peronskayas remarks about his rudeness and approaching natashahe held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed hisinvitation he asked her to waltz that tremulous expression onnatashas face prepared either for despair or rapture suddenlybrightened into a happy grateful childlike smilei have long been waiting for you that frightened happy little girlseemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears as sheraised her hand to prince andrews shoulder they were the second coupleto enter the circle prince andrew was one of the best dancers of hisday and natasha danced exquisitely her little feet in their white satindancing shoes did their work swiftly lightly and independently ofherself while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness her slender barearms and neck were not beautifulcompared to helenes her shoulderslooked thin and her bosom undeveloped but helene seemed as it werehardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had scannedher person while natasha was like a girl exposed for the first timewho would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured that thiswas absolutely necessaryprince andrew liked dancing and wishing to escape as quickly aspossible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed tohim wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he dislikedcaused by the emperors presence he danced and had chosen natashabecause pierre pointed her out to him and because she was the firstpretty girl who caught his eye but scarcely had he embraced thatslender supple figure and felt her stirring so close to him and smilingso near him than the wine of her charm rose to his head and he felthimself revived and rejuvenated when after leaving her he stoodbreathing deeply and watching the other dancersafter prince andrew boris came up to ask natasha for a dance and thenthe aidedecamp who had opened the ball and several other young menso that flushed and happy and passing on her superfluous partners tosonya she did not cease dancing all the evening she noticed and sawnothing of what occupied everyone else not only did she fail to noticethat the emperor talked a long time with the french ambassador and howparticularly gracious he was to a certain lady or that prince soandsoand soandso did and said this and that and that helene had greatsuccess and was honored by the special attention of soandso but shedid not even see the emperor and only noticed that he had gone becausethe ball became livelier after his departure for one of the merrycotillions before supper prince andrew was again her partner hereminded her of their first encounter in the otradnoe avenue and howshe had been unable to sleep that moonlight night and told her how hehad involuntarily overheard her natasha blushed at that recollectionand tried to excuse herself as if there had been something to beashamed of in what prince andrew had overheardlike all men who have grown up in society prince andrew liked meetingsomeone there not of the conventional society stamp and such wasnatasha with her surprise her delight her shyness and even hermistakes in speaking french with her he behaved with special care andtenderness sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and mostunimportant matters he admired her shy grace in the middle of thecotillion having completed one of the figures natasha still out ofbreath was returning to her seat when another dancer chose her she wastired and panting and evidently thought of declining but immediatelyput her hand gaily on the mans shoulder smiling at prince andrewid be glad to sit beside you and rest im tired but you see how theykeep asking me and im glad of it im happy and i love everybody andyou and i understand it all and much much more was said in her smilewhen her partner left her natasha ran across the room to choose twoladies for the figureif she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady she will bemy wife said prince andrew to himself quite to his own surprise as hewatched her she did go first to her cousinwhat rubbish sometimes enters ones head thought prince andrew butwhat is certain is that that girl is so charming so original that shewont be dancing here a month before she will be married such as sheare rare here he thought as natasha readjusting a rose that wasslipping on her bodice settled herself beside himwhen the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up tothe dancers he invited prince andrew to come and see them and askedhis daughter whether she was enjoying herself natasha did not answer atonce but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully how canyou ask such a questioni have never enjoyed myself so much before she said and princeandrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace herfather and instantly dropped again natasha was happier than she hadever been in her life she was at that height of bliss when one becomescompletely kind and good and does not believe in the possibility ofevil unhappiness or sorrowat that ball pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the positionhis wife occupied in court circles he was gloomy and absentminded adeep furrow ran across his forehead and standing by a window he staredover his spectacles seeing no oneon her way to supper natasha passed himpierres gloomy unhappy look struck her she stopped in front of himshe wished to help him to bestow on him the superabundance of her ownhappinesshow delightful it is count said she isnt itpierre smiled absentmindedly evidently not grasping what she saidyes i am very glad he saidhow can people be dissatisfied with anything thought natashaespecially such a capital fellow as bezukhov in natashas eyes allthe people at the ball alike were good kind and splendid peopleloving one another none of them capable of injuring anotherand sothey ought all to be happynext day prince andrew thought of the ball but his mind did not dwellon it long yes it was a very brilliant ball and then yes thatlittle rostova is very charming theres something fresh original unpetersburglike about her that distinguishes her that was all hethought about yesterdays ball and after his morning tea he set toworkbut either from fatigue or want of sleep he was illdisposed for workand could get nothing done he kept criticizing his own work as heoften did and was glad when he heard someone comingthe visitor was bitski who served on various committees frequented allthe societies in petersburg and a passionate devotee of the new ideasand of speranski and a diligent petersburg newsmongerone of those menwho choose their opinions like their clothes according to the fashionbut who for that very reason appear to be the warmest partisans hardlyhad he got rid of his hat before he ran into prince andrews room with apreoccupied air and at once began talking he had just heard particularsof that mornings sitting of the council of state opened by the emperorand he spoke of it enthusiastically the emperors speech had beenextraordinary it had been a speech such as only constitutional monarchsdeliver the sovereign plainly said that the council and senate areestates of the realm he said that the government must rest not onauthority but on secure bases the emperor said that the fiscal systemmust be reorganized and the accounts published recounted bitskiemphasizing certain words and opening his eyes significantlyah yes todays events mark an epoch the greatest epoch in ourhistory he concludedprince andrew listened to the account of the opening of the council ofstate which he had so impatiently awaited and to which he had attachedsuch importance and was surprised that this event now that it hadtaken place did not affect him and even seemed quite insignificant helistened with quiet irony to bitskis enthusiastic account of it a verysimple thought occurred to him what does it matter to me or to bitskiwhat the emperor was pleased to say at the council can all that make meany happier or betterand this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest princeandrew had felt in the impending reforms he was going to dine thatevening at speranskis with only a few friends as the host had saidwhen inviting him the prospect of that dinner in the intimate homecircle of the man he so admired had greatly interested prince andrewespecially as he had not yet seen speranski in his domesticsurroundings but now he felt disinclined to go to itat the appointed hour however he entered the modest house speranskiowned in the taurida gardens in the parqueted dining room this smallhouse remarkable for its extreme cleanliness suggesting that of amonastery prince andrew who was rather late found the friendlygathering of speranskis intimate acquaintances already assembled atfive oclock there were no ladies present except speranskis littledaughter longfaced like her father and her governess the otherguests were gervais magnitski and stolypin while still in theanteroom prince andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato laughalaugh such as one hears on the stage someoneit sounded likesperanskiwas distinctly ejaculating hahaha prince andrew had neverbefore heard speranskis famous laugh and this ringing highpitchedlaughter from a statesman made a strange impression on himhe entered the dining room the whole company were standing between twowindows at a small table laid with horsdoeuvres speranski wearing agray swallowtail coat with a star on the breast and evidently stillthe same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting ofthe council of state stood at the table with a beaming countenance hisguests surrounded him magnitski addressing himself to speranski wasrelating an anecdote and speranski was laughing in advance at whatmagnitski was going to say when prince andrew entered the roommagnitskis words were again crowned by laughter stolypin gave a deepbass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese gervais laughedsoftly with a hissing chuckle and speranski in a highpitched staccatomannerstill laughing speranski held out his soft white hand to prince andrewvery pleased to see you prince he said one moment he went onturning to magnitski and interrupting his story we have agreed thatthis is a dinner for recreation with not a word about business andturning again to the narrator he began to laugh afreshprince andrew looked at the laughing speranski with astonishmentregret and disillusionment it seemed to him that this was notsperanski but someone else everything that had formerly appearedmysterious and fascinating in speranski suddenly became plain andunattractiveat dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed toconsist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes before magnitskihad finished his story someone else was anxious to relate somethingstill funnier most of the anecdotes if not relating to the stateservice related to people in the service it seemed that in thiscompany the insignificance of those people was so definitely acceptedthat the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humoredridicule speranski related how at the council that morning a deafdignitary when asked his opinion replied that he thought so toogervais gave a long account of an official revision remarkable for thestupidity of everybody concerned stolypin stuttering broke into theconversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existedunder the former order of thingsthreatening to give a serious turn tothe conversation magnitski starting quizzing stolypin about hisvehemence gervais intervened with a joke and the talk reverted to itsformer lively toneevidently speranski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement ina circle of friends and his guests understanding his wish tried toenliven him and amuse themselves but their gaiety seemed to princeandrew mirthless and tiresome speranskis highpitched voice struck himunpleasantly and the incessant laughter grated on him like a falsenote prince andrew did not laugh and feared that he would be a damperon the spirits of the company but no one took any notice of his beingout of harmony with the general mood they all seemed very gayhe tried several times to join in the conversation but his remarks weretossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water and he couldnot jest with themthere was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said it was witty andmight have been funny but it lacked just that something which is thesalt of mirth and they were not even aware that such a thing existedafter dinner speranskis daughter and her governess rose he patted thelittle girl with his white hand and kissed her and that gesture tooseemed unnatural to prince andrewthe men remained at table over their portenglish fashion in the midstof a conversation that was started about napoleons spanish affairswhich they all agreed in approving prince andrew began to express acontrary opinion speranski smiled and with an evident wish to preventthe conversation from taking an unpleasant course told a story that hadno connection with the previous conversation for a few moments all weresilenthaving sat some time at table speranski corked a bottle of wine andremarking nowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair passed itto the servant and got up all rose and continuing to talk loudly wentinto the drawing room two letters brought by a courier were handed tosperanski and he took them to his study as soon as he had left the roomthe general merriment stopped and the guests began to converse sensiblyand quietly with one anothernow for the recitation said speranski on returning from his study awonderful talent he said to prince andrew and magnitski immediatelyassumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses in french whichhe had composed about various wellknown petersburg people he wasinterrupted several times by applause when the verses were finishedprince andrew went up to speranski and took his leavewhere are you off to so early asked speranskii promised to go to a receptionthey said no more prince andrew looked closely into those mirrorlikeimpenetrable eyes and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to haveexpected anything from speranski and from any of his own activitiesconnected with him or ever to have attributed importance to whatsperanski was doing that precise mirthless laughter rang in princeandrews ears long after he had left the housewhen he reached home prince andrew began thinking of his life inpetersburg during those last four months as if it were something new herecalled his exertions and solicitations and the history of his projectof army reform which had been accepted for consideration and which theywere trying to pass over in silence simply because another a very poorone had already been prepared and submitted to the emperor he thoughtof the meetings of a committee of which berg was a member he rememberedhow carefully and at what length everything relating to form andprocedure was discussed at those meetings and how sedulously andpromptly all that related to the gist of the business was evaded herecalled his labors on the legal code and how painstakingly he hadtranslated the articles of the roman and french codes into russian andhe felt ashamed of himself then he vividly pictured to himselfbogucharovo his occupations in the country his journey to ryazan heremembered the peasants and dron the village elder and mentallyapplying to them the personal rights he had divided into paragraphs hefelt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such uselessworknext day prince andrew called at a few houses he had not visited beforeand among them at the rostovs with whom he had renewed acquaintance atthe ball apart from considerations of politeness which demanded thecall he wanted to see that original eager girl who had left such apleasant impression on his mind in her own homenatasha was one of the first to meet him she was wearing a darkbluehouse dress in which prince andrew thought her even prettier than in herball dress she and all the rostov family welcomed him as an old friendsimply and cordially the whole family whom he had formerly judgedseverely now seemed to him to consist of excellent simple and kindlypeople the old counts hospitality and good nature which struck oneespecially in petersburg as a pleasant surprise were such that princeandrew could not refuse to stay to dinner yes he thought they arecapital people who of course have not the slightest idea what atreasure they possess in natasha but they are kindly folk and form thebest possible setting for this strikingly poetic charming girloverflowing with lifein natasha prince andrew was conscious of a strange world completelyalien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him a different world thatin the otradnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night hadalready begun to disconcert him now this world disconcerted him nolonger and was no longer alien to him but he himself having entered itfound in it a new enjoymentafter dinner natasha at prince andrews request went to the clavichordand began singing prince andrew stood by a window talking to the ladiesand listened to her in the midst of a phrase he ceased speaking andsuddenly felt tears choking him a thing he had thought impossible forhim he looked at natasha as she sang and something new and joyfulstirred in his soul he felt happy and at the same time sad he hadabsolutely nothing to weep about yet he was ready to weep what abouthis former love the little princess his disillusionments his hopesfor the future yes and no the chief reason was a sudden vividsense of the terrible contrast between something infinitely great andillimitable within him and that limited and material something that heand even she was this contrast weighed on and yet cheered him whileshe sangas soon as natasha had finished she went up to him and asked how heliked her voice she asked this and then became confused feeling thatshe ought not to have asked it he smiled looking at her and said heliked her singing as he liked everything she didprince andrew left the rostovs late in the evening he went to bed fromhabit but soon realized that he could not sleep having lit his candlehe sat up in bed then got up then lay down again not at all troubledby his sleeplessness his soul was as fresh and joyful as if he hadstepped out of a stuffy room into gods own fresh air it did not enterhis head that he was in love with natasha he was not thinking abouther but only picturing her to himself and in consequence all lifeappeared in a new light why do i strive why do i toil in this narrowconfined frame when life all life with all its joys is open to mesaid he to himself and for the first time for a very long while hebegan making happy plans for the future he decided that he must attendto his sons education by finding a tutor and putting the boy in hischarge then he ought to retire from the service and go abroad and seeengland switzerland and italy i must use my freedom while i feel somuch strength and youth in me he said to himself pierre was rightwhen he said one must believe in the possibility of happiness in orderto be happy and now i do believe in it let the dead bury their deadbut while one has life one must live and be happy thought heone morning colonel berg whom pierre knew as he knew everybody inmoscow and petersburg came to see him berg arrived in an immaculatebrandnew uniform with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over histemples as the emperor alexander wore his hairi have just been to see the countess your wife unfortunately shecould not grant my request but i hope count i shall be more fortunatewith you he said with a smilewhat is it you wish colonel i am at your servicei have now quite settled in my new rooms count berg said this withperfect conviction that this information could not but be agreeableand so i wish to arrange just a small party for my own and my wifesfriends he smiled still more pleasantly i wished to ask thecountess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea and to supperonly countess helene considering the society of such people as thebergs beneath her could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitationberg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at his house a smallbut select company and why this would give him pleasure and why thoughhe grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful he was preparedto run into some expense for the sake of good societythat pierre couldnot refuse and promised to comebut dont be late count if i may venture to ask about ten minutes toeight please we shall make up a rubber our general is coming he isvery good to me we shall have supper count so you will do me thefavorcontrary to his habit of being late pierre on that day arrived at thebergs house not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eighthaving prepared everything necessary for the party the bergs were readyfor their guests arrivalin their new clean and light study with its small busts and picturesand new furniture sat berg and his wife berg closely buttoned up inhis new uniform sat beside his wife explaining to her that one alwayscould and should be acquainted with people above one because only thendoes one get satisfaction from acquaintancesyou can get to know something you can ask for something see how imanaged from my first promotion berg measured his life not by yearsbut by promotions my comrades are still nobodies while i am onlywaiting for a vacancy to command a regiment and have the happiness tobe your husband he rose and kissed veras hand and on the way to herstraightened out a turnedup corner of the carpet and how have iobtained all this chiefly by knowing how to choose my aquaintances itgoes without saying that one must be conscientious and methodicalberg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman andpaused reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weakwoman who could not understand all that constitutes a mans dignitywhat it was ein mann zu sein  vera at the same time smiling with asense of superiority over her good conscientious husband who all thesame understood life wrongly as according to vera all men did bergjudging by his wife thought all women weak and foolish vera judgingonly by her husband and generalizing from that observation supposedthat all men though they understand nothing and are conceited andselfish ascribe common sense to themselves alone to be a manberg rose and embraced his wife carefully so as not to crush her lacefichu for which he had paid a good price kissing her straight on thelipsthe only thing is we mustnt have children too soon he continuedfollowing an unconscious sequence of ideasyes answered vera i dont at all want that we must live forsocietyprincess yusupova wore one exactly like this said berg pointing tothe fichu with a happy and kindly smilejust then count bezukhov was announced husband and wife glanced at oneanother both smiling with selfsatisfaction and each mentally claimingthe honor of this visitthis is what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances thought bergthis is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneselfbut please dont interrupt me when i am entertaining the guests saidvera because i know what interests each of them and what to say todifferent peopleberg smiled againit cant be helped men must sometimes have masculine conversationsaid hethey received pierre in their small new drawingroom where it wasimpossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetryneatness and order so it was quite comprehensible and not strange thatberg having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchairor of the sofa for his dear guest but being apparently painfullyundecided on the matter himself eventually left the visitor to settlethe question of selection pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving achair for himself and berg and vera immediately began their eveningparty interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain theirguestvera having decided in her own mind that pierre ought to be entertainedwith conversation about the french embassy at once began accordinglyberg having decided that masculine conversation was requiredinterrupted his wifes remarks and touched on the question of the warwith austria and unconsciously jumped from the general subject topersonal considerations as to the proposals made him to take part in theaustrian campaign and the reasons why he had declined them though theconversation was very incoherent and vera was angry at the intrusion ofthe masculine element both husband and wife felt with satisfactionthat even if only one guest was present their evening had begun verywell and was as like as two peas to every other evening party with itstalk tea and lighted candlesbefore long boris bergs old comrade arrived there was a shade ofcondescension and patronage in his treatment of berg and vera afterboris came a lady with the colonel then the general himself then therostovs and the party became unquestionably exactly like all otherevening parties berg and vera could not repress their smiles ofsatisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing room atthe sound of the disconnected talk the rustling of dresses and thebowing and scraping everything was just as everybody always has itespecially so the general who admired the apartment patted berg on theshoulder and with parental authority superintended the setting out ofthe table for boston the general sat down by count ilya rostov who wasnext to himself the most important guest the old people sat with theold the young with the young and the hostess at the tea table onwhich stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a silver cake basket asthe panins had at their party everything was just as it was everywhereelsepierre as one of the principal guests had to sit down to boston withcount rostov the general and the colonel at the card table hehappened to be directly facing natasha and was struck by a curiouschange that had come over her since the ball she was silent and notonly less pretty than at the ball but only redeemed from plainness byher look of gentle indifference to everything aroundwhats the matter with her thought pierre glancing at her she wassitting by her sister at the tea table and reluctantly without lookingat him made some reply to boris who sat down beside her after playingout a whole suit and to his partners delight taking five trickspierre hearing greetings and the steps of someone who had entered theroom while he was picking up his tricks glanced again at natashawhat has happened to her he asked himself with still greatersurpriseprince andrew was standing before her saying something to her with alook of tender solicitude she having raised her head was looking upat him flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing andthe bright glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was againalight in her she was completely transformed and from a plain girl hadagain become what she had been at the ballprince andrew went up to pierre and the latter noticed a new andyouthful expression in his friends facepierre changed places several times during the game sitting now withhis back to natasha and now facing her but during the whole of the sixrubbers he watched her and his friendsomething very important is happening between them thought pierreand a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and made himneglect the gameafter six rubbers the general got up saying that it was no use playinglike that and pierre was released natasha on one side was talking withsonya and boris and vera with a subtle smile was saying something toprince andrew pierre went up to his friend and asking whether theywere talking secrets sat down beside them vera having noticed princeandrews attentions to natasha decided that at a party a real eveningparty subtle allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessaryand seizing a moment when prince andrew was alone began a conversationwith him about feelings in general and about her sister with sointellectual a guest as she considered prince andrew to be she feltthat she had to employ her diplomatic tactwhen pierre went up to them he noticed that vera was being carried awayby her selfsatisfied talk but that prince andrew seemed embarrassed athing that rarely happened with himwhat do you think vera was saying with an arch smile you are sodiscerning prince and understand peoples characters so well at aglance what do you think of natalie could she be constant in herattachments could she like other women vera meant herself love aman once for all and remain true to him forever that is what i considertrue love what do you think princei know your sister too little replied prince andrew with a sarcasticsmile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment to be able tosolve so delicate a question and then i have noticed that the lessattractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be he addedand looked up at pierre who was just approaching themyes that is true prince in our days continued veramentioningour days as people of limited intelligence are fond of doingimagining that they have discovered and appraised the peculiarities ofour days and that human characteristics change with the timesin ourdays a girl has so much freedom that the pleasure of being courted oftenstifles real feeling in her and it must be confessed that natalie isvery susceptible this return to the subject of natalie caused princeandrew to knit his brows with discomfort he was about to rise but veracontinued with a still more subtle smilei think no one has been more courted than she she went on but tillquite lately she never cared seriously for anyone now you know countshe said to pierre even our dear cousin boris who between ourselveswas very far gone in the land of tenderness alluding to a map oflove much in vogue at that timeprince andrew frowned and remained silentyou are friendly with boris arent you asked verayes i know himi expect he has told you of his childish love for natashaoh there was childish love suddenly asked prince andrew blushingunexpectedlyyes you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love lecousinage est un dangereux voisinage  dont you think so cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhoodoh undoubtedly said prince andrew and with sudden and unnaturalliveliness he began chaffing pierre about the need to be very carefulwith his fiftyyearold moscow cousins and in the midst of thesejesting remarks he rose taking pierre by the arm and drew him asidewell asked pierre seeing his friends strange animation withsurprise and noticing the glance he turned on natasha as he rosei must i must have a talk with you said prince andrew you knowthat pair of womens gloves he referred to the masonic gloves givento a newly initiated brother to present to the woman he loved ibut no i will talk to you later on and with a strange light in hiseyes and restlessness in his movements prince andrew approached natashaand sat down beside her pierre saw how prince andrew asked hersomething and how she flushed as she repliedbut at that moment berg came to pierre and began insisting that heshould take part in an argument between the general and the colonel onthe affairs in spainberg was satisfied and happy the smile of pleasure never left his facethe party was very successful and quite like other parties he had seeneverything was similar the ladies subtle talk the cards the generalraising his voice at the card table and the samovar and the tea cakesonly one thing was lacking that he had always seen at the eveningparties he wished to imitate they had not yet had a loud conversationamong the men and a dispute about something important and clever nowthe general had begun such a discussion and so berg drew pierre to itnext day having been invited by the count prince andrew dined with therostovs and spent the rest of the day thereeveryone in the house realized for whose sake prince andrew came andwithout concealing it he tried to be with natasha all day not only inthe soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured natasha but in thewhole house there was a feeling of awe at something important that wasbound to happen the countess looked with sad and sternly serious eyesat prince andrew when he talked to natasha and timidly started someartificial conversation about trifles as soon as he looked her waysonya was afraid to leave natasha and afraid of being in the way whenshe was with them natasha grew pale in a panic of expectation whenshe remained alone with him for a moment prince andrew surprised her byhis timidity she felt that he wanted to say something to her but couldnot bring himself to do soin the evening when prince andrew had left the countess went up tonatasha and whispered well whatmamma for heavens sake dont ask me anything now one cant talkabout that said natashabut all the same that night natasha now agitated and now frightenedlay a long time in her mothers bed gazing straight before her she toldher how he had complimented her how he told her he was going abroadasked her where they were going to spend the summer and then how he hadasked her about borisbut such a such a never happened to me before she said only ifeel afraid in his presence i am always afraid when im with him whatdoes that mean does it mean that its the real thing yes mamma areyou asleepno my love i am frightened myself answered her mother now goall the same i shant sleep what silliness to sleep mummy mummysuch a thing never happened to me before she said surprised andalarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself and could we everhave thoughtit seemed to natasha that even at the time she first saw prince andrewat otradnoe she had fallen in love with him it was as if she fearedthis strange unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she hadthen chosen she was firmly convinced she had done so and of findinghim as it seemed not indifferent to herand it had to happen that he should come specially to petersburg whilewe are here and it had to happen that we should meet at that ball itis fate clearly it is fate that everything led up to this alreadythen directly i saw him i felt something peculiarwhat else did he say to you what are those verses read them saidher mother thoughtfully referring to some verses prince andrew hadwritten in natashas albummamma one need not be ashamed of his being a widowerdont natasha pray to god marriages are made in heaven said hermotherdarling mummy how i love you how happy i am cried natasha sheddingtears of joy and excitement and embracing her motherat that very time prince andrew was sitting with pierre and telling himof his love for natasha and his firm resolve to make her his wifethat day countess helene had a reception at her house the frenchambassador was there and a foreign prince of the blood who had of latebecome a frequent visitor of hers and many brilliant ladies andgentlemen pierre who had come downstairs walked through the rooms andstruck everyone by his preoccupied absentminded and morose airsince the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depressionand had made desperate efforts to combat it since the intimacy of hiswife with the royal prince pierre had unexpectedly been made agentleman of the bedchamber and from that time he had begun to feeloppressed and ashamed in court society and dark thoughts of the vanityof all things human came to him oftener than before at the same timethe feeling he had noticed between his protegee natasha and princeandrew accentuated his gloom by the contrast between his own positionand his friends he tried equally to avoid thinking about his wife andabout natasha and prince andrew and again everything seemed to himinsignificant in comparison with eternity again the question for whatpresented itself and he forced himself to work day and night at masoniclabors hoping to drive away the evil spirit that threatened him towardmidnight after he had left the countess apartments he was sittingupstairs in a shabby dressing gown copying out the original transactionof the scottish lodge of freemasons at a table in his low room cloudywith tobacco smoke when someone came in it was prince andrewah its you said pierre with a preoccupied dissatisfied air andi you see am hard at it he pointed to his manuscript book with thatair of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy people look attheir workprince andrew with a beaming ecstatic expression of renewed life onhis face paused in front of pierre and not noticing his sad looksmiled at him with the egotism of joywell dear heart said he i wanted to tell you about it yesterdayand i have come to do so today i never experienced anything like itbefore i am in love my friendsuddenly pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person down onthe sofa beside prince andrewwith natasha rostova yes said heyes yes who else should it be i should never have believed it butthe feeling is stronger than i yesterday i tormented myself andsuffered but i would not exchange even that torment for anything in theworld i have not lived till now at last i live but i cant livewithout her but can she love me i am too old for her why dontyou speaki i what did i tell you said pierre suddenly rising and beginningto pace up and down the room i always thought it that girl is sucha treasure she is a rare girl my dear friend i entreat youdont philosophize dont doubt marry marry marry and i am surethere will not be a happier man than youbut what of hershe loves youdont talk rubbish said prince andrew smiling and looking intopierres eyesshe does i know pierre cried fiercelybut do listen returned prince andrew holding him by the arm do youknow the condition i am in i must talk about it to someonewell go on go on i am very glad said pierre and his face reallychanged his brow became smooth and he listened gladly to princeandrew prince andrew seemed and really was quite a different quite anew man where was his spleen his contempt for life hisdisillusionment pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mindto speak openly and to him he told all that was in his soul now heboldly and lightly made plans for an extended future said he could notsacrifice his own happiness to his fathers caprice and spoke of how hewould either make his father consent to this marriage and love her orwould do without his consent then he marveled at the feeling that hadmastered him as at something strange apart from and independent ofhimselfi should not have believed anyone who told me that i was capable ofsuch love said prince andrew it is not at all the same feeling thati knew in the past the whole world is now for me divided into twohalves one half is she and there all is joy hope light the otherhalf is everything where she is not and there is all gloom anddarknessdarkness and gloom reiterated pierre yes yes i understand thati cannot help loving the light it is not my fault and i am veryhappy you understand me i know you are glad for my sakeyes yes pierre assented looking at his friend with a touched andsad expression in his eyes the brighter prince andrews lot appeared tohim the gloomier seemed his ownprince andrew needed his fathers consent to his marriage and to obtainthis he started for the country next dayhis father received his sons communication with external composure butinward wrath he could not comprehend how anyone could wish to alter hislife or introduce anything new into it when his own life was alreadyending if only they would let me end my days as i want to thoughtthe old man then they might do as they please with his son howeverhe employed the diplomacy he reserved for important occasions andadopting a quiet tone discussed the whole matterin the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regardsbirth wealth or rank secondly prince andrew was no longer as youngas he had been and his health was poor the old man laid special stresson this while she was very young thirdly he had a son whom it wouldbe a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl fourthly and finally thefather said looking ironically at his son i beg you to put it off fora year go abroad take a cure look out as you wanted to for a germantutor for prince nicholas then if your love or passion or obstinacyasyou pleaseis still as great marry and thats my last word on itmind the last concluded the prince in a tone which showed thatnothing would make him alter his decisionprince andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings orhis fiancees would not stand a years test or that he the old princehimself would die before then and he decided to conform to hisfathers wishto propose and postpone the wedding for a yearthree weeks after the last evening he had spent with the rostovs princeandrew returned to petersburgnext day after her talk with her mother natasha expected bolkonski allday but he did not come on the second and third day it was the samepierre did not come either and natasha not knowing that prince andrewhad gone to see his father could not explain his absence to herselfthree weeks passed in this way natasha had no desire to go out anywhereand wandered from room to room like a shadow idle and listless shewept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in the evenings sheblushed continually and was irritable it seemed to her that everybodyknew about her disappointment and was laughing at her and pitying herstrong as was her inward grief this wound to her vanity intensified hermiseryonce she came to her mother tried to say something and suddenly beganto cry her tears were those of an offended child who does not know whyit is being punishedthe countess began to soothe natasha who after first listening to hermothers words suddenly interrupted herleave off mamma i dont think and dont want to think about it hejust came and then left off left offher voice trembled and she again nearly cried but recovered and wenton quietlyand i dont at all want to get married and i am afraid of him i havenow become quite calm quite calmthe day after this conversation natasha put on the old dress which sheknew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in themornings and that day she returned to the old way of life which she hadabandoned since the ball having finished her morning tea she went tothe ballroom which she particularly liked for its loud resonance andbegan singing her solfeggio when she had finished her first exerciseshe stood still in the middle of the room and sang a musical phrase thatparticularly pleased her she listened joyfully as though she had notexpected it to the charm of the notes reverberating filling the wholeempty ballroom and slowly dying away and all at once she feltcheerful whats the good of making so much of it things are nice asit is she said to herself and she began walking up and down the roomnot stepping simply on the resounding parquet but treading with eachstep from the heel to the toe she had on a new and favorite pair ofshoes and listening to the regular tap of the heel and creak of the toeas gladly as she had to the sounds of her own voice passing a mirrorshe glanced into it there thats me the expression of her faceseemed to say as she caught sight of herself well and very nice tooi need nobodya footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but shewould not let him and having closed the door behind him continued herwalk that morning she had returned to her favorite moodlove of anddelight in herself how charming that natasha is she said againspeaking as some third collective male person pretty a good voiceyoung and in nobodys way if only they leave her in peace but howevermuch they left her in peace she could not now be at peace andimmediately felt thisin the hall the porch door opened and someone asked at home andthen footsteps were heard natasha was looking at the mirror but didnot see herself she listened to the sounds in the hall when she sawherself her face was pale it was he she knew this for certain thoughshe hardly heard his voice through the closed doorspale and agitated natasha ran into the drawing roommamma bolkonski has come she said mamma it is awful it isunbearable i dont want to be tormented what am i to dobefore the countess could answer prince andrew entered the room with anagitated and serious face as soon as he saw natasha his facebrightened he kissed the countess hand and natashas and sat downbeside the sofait is long since we had the pleasure began the countess but princeandrew interrupted her by answering her intended question obviously

deep sigh as her daughter ran awaynatasha never remembered how she entered the drawing room when she camein and saw him she paused is it possible that this stranger has nowbecome everything to me she asked herself and immediately answeredyes everything he alone is now dearer to me than everything in theworld prince andrew came up to her with downcast eyesi have loved you from the very first moment

began to sobwhat is it whats the matteroh i am so happy she replied smiled through her tears bent overcloser to him paused for an instant as if asking herself whether shemight and then kissed himprince andrew held her hands looked into her eyes and did not find inhis heart his former love for her something in him had suddenlychanged there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm ofdesire but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness fearat her devotion and trustfulness and an oppressive yet joyful sense ofthe duty that now bound him to her forever the present feeling thoughnot so bright and poetic as the former was stronger and more seriousdid your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year asked princeandrew still looking into her eyesis it possible that ithe chit of a girl as everybody called methought natashais it possible that i am now to be the wife and theequal of this strange dear clever man whom even my father looks up tocan it be true can

whole year natasha repeated suddenly only now realizing that themarriage was to be postponed for a year but why a year why ayearprince andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delaynatasha did not hear himand cant it be helped she asked prince andrew did not reply buthis face expressed the impossibility of altering that decisionits awful oh its awful awful natasha suddenly cried and againburst into sobs i shall die waiting a year its impossible itsawful she looked into her lovers face and saw in it a look ofcommiseration and perplexityno no ill do anything she said suddenly checking her tears i amso happythe father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed coupletheir blessingfrom that day prince andrew began to frequent the rostovs as natashasaffianced loverno betrothal ceremony took place and natashas engagement to bolkonskiwas not announced prince andrew insisted on that he said that as hewas responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole burden of itthat he had given his word and bound himself forever but that he didnot wish to bind natasha and gave her perfect freedom if after sixmonths she felt that she did not love him she would have full right toreject him naturally neither natasha nor her parents wished to hear ofthis but prince andrew was firm he came every day to the rostovs butdid not behave to natasha as an affianced lover he did not use thefamiliar thou but said you to her and kissed only her hand aftertheir engagement quite different intimate and natural relationssprang up between them it was as if they had not known each other tillnow both liked to recall how they had regarded each other when as yetthey were nothing to one another they felt themselves now quitedifferent beings then they were artificial now natural and sincere atfirst the family felt some constraint in intercourse with prince andrewhe seemed a man from another world and for a long time natasha trainedthe family to get used to him proudly assuring them all that he onlyappeared to be different but was really just like all of them and thatshe was not afraid of him and no one else ought to be after a few daysthey grew accustomed to him and without restraint in his presencepursued their usual way of life in which he took his part he couldtalk about rural economy with the count fashions with the countess andnatasha and about albums and fancywork with sonya sometimes thehousehold both among themselves and in his presence expressed theirwonder at how it had all happened and at the evident omens there hadbeen of it prince andrews coming to otradnoe and their coming topetersburg and the likeness between natasha and prince andrew which hernurse had noticed on his first visit and andrews encounter withnicholas in  and many other incidents betokening that it had to bein the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which alwaysaccompanies the presence of a betrothed couple often when all sittingtogether everyone kept silent sometimes the others would get up and goaway and the couple left alone still remained silent they rarelyspoke of their future life prince andrew was afraid and ashamed tospeak of it natasha shared this as she did all his feelings which sheconstantly divined once she began questioning him about his son princeandrew blushed as he often did nownatasha particularly liked it inhimand said that his son would not live with themwhy not asked natasha in a frightened tonei cannot take him away from his grandfather and besideshow i should have loved him said natasha immediately guessing histhought but i know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding faultwith ussometimes the old count would come up kiss prince andrew and ask hisadvice about petyas education or nicholas service the old countesssighed as she looked at them sonya was always getting frightened lestshe should be in the way and tried to find excuses for leaving themalone even when they did not wish it when prince andrew spoke hecould tell a story very well natasha listened to him with pride whenshe spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed attentively andscrutinizingly at her she asked herself in perplexity what does helook for in me he is trying to discover something by looking at mewhat if what he seeks in me is not there sometimes she fell into oneof the mad merry moods characteristic of her and then she particularlyloved to hear and see how prince andrew laughed he seldom laughed butwhen he did he abandoned himself entirely to his laughter and aftersuch a laugh she always felt nearer to him natasha would have beencompletely happy if the thought of the separation awaiting her anddrawing near had not terrified her just as the mere thought of it madehim turn pale and coldon the eve of his departure from petersburg prince andrew brought withhim pierre who had not been to the rostovs once since the ball pierreseemed disconcerted and embarrassed he was talking to the countess andnatasha sat down beside a little chess table with sonya therebyinviting prince andrew to come too he did soyou have known bezukhov a long time he asked do you like himyes hes a dear but very absurdand as usual when speaking of pierre she began to tell anecdotes of hisabsentmindedness some of which had even been invented about himdo you know i have entrusted him with our secret i have known him fromchildhood he has a heart of gold i beg you natalie prince andrewsaid with sudden seriousnessi am going away and heaven knows what mayhappen you may cease to all right i know i am not to say that onlythis then whatever may happen to you when i am not herewhat can happenwhatever trouble may come prince andrew continued i beg youmademoiselle sophie whatever may happen to turn to him alone foradvice and help he is a most absentminded and absurd fellow but hehas a heart of goldneither her father nor her mother nor sonya nor prince andrew himselfcould have foreseen how the separation from her lover would act onnatasha flushed and agitated she went about the house all that daydryeyed occupied with most trivial matters as if not understandingwhat awaited her she did not even cry when on taking leave he kissedher hand for the last time dont go she said in a tone that made himwonder whether he really ought not to stay and which he remembered longafterwards nor did she cry when he was gone but for several days shesat in her room dryeyed taking no interest in anything and only sayingnow and then oh why did he go awaybut a fortnight after his departure to the surprise of those aroundher she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and becameher old self again but with a change in her moral physiognomy as achild gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of faceduring that year after his sons departure prince nicholas bolkonskishealth and temper became much worse he grew still more irritable andit was princess mary who generally bore the brunt of his frequent fitsof unprovoked anger he seemed carefully to seek out her tender spots soas to torture her mentally as harshly as possible princess mary had twopassions and consequently two joysher nephew little nicholas andreligionand these were the favorite subjects of the princes attacksand ridicule whatever was spoken of he would bring round to thesuperstitiousness of old maids or the petting and spoiling of childrenyou want to make himlittle nicholasinto an old maid likeyourself a pity prince andrew wants a son and not an old maid hewould say or turning to mademoiselle bourienne he would ask her inprincess marys presence how she liked our village priests and icons andwould joke about themhe continually hurt princess marys feelings and tormented her but itcost her no effort to forgive him could he be to blame toward her orcould her father whom she knew loved her in spite of it all be unjustand what is justice the princess never thought of that proud wordjustice all the complex laws of man centered for her in one clear andsimple lawthe law of love and selfsacrifice taught us by him wholovingly suffered for mankind though he himself was god what had she todo with the justice or injustice of other people she had to endure andlove and that she didduring the winter prince andrew had come to bald hills and had been gaygentle and more affectionate than princess mary had known him for along time past she felt that something had happened to him but he saidnothing to her about his love before he left he had a long talk withhis father about something and princess mary noticed that before hisdeparture they were dissatisfied with one anothersoon after prince andrew had gone princess mary wrote to her friendjulie karagina in petersburg whom she had dreamed as all girls dreamof marrying to her brother and who was at that time in mourning for herown brother killed in turkeysorrow it seems is our common lot my dear tender friend julieyour loss is so terrible that i can only explain it to myself as aspecial providence of god who loving you wishes to try you and yourexcellent mother oh my friend religion and religion alone caniwill not say comfort usbut save us from despair religion alone canexplain to us what without its help man cannot comprehend why for whatcause kind and noble beings able to find happiness in lifenot merelyharming no one but necessary to the happiness of othersare called awayto god while cruel useless harmful persons or such as are a burdento themselves and to others are left living the first death i saw andone i shall never forgetthat of my dear sisterinlawleft thatimpression on me just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother hadto die so i asked why that angel lise who not only never wrongedanyone but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts had todie and what do you think dear friend five years have passed sincethen and already i with my petty understanding begin to see clearlywhy she had to die and in what way that death was but an expression ofthe infinite goodness of the creator whose every action thoughgenerally incomprehensible to us is but a manifestation of his infinitelove for his creatures perhaps i often think she was too angelicallyinnocent to have the strength to perform all a mothers duties as ayoung wife she was irreproachable perhaps she could not have been so asa mother as it is not only has she left us and particularly princeandrew with the purest regrets and memories but probably she willthere receive a place i dare not hope for myself but not to speak ofher alone that early and terrible death has had the most beneficentinfluence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief then atthe moment of our loss these thoughts could not occur to me i shouldthen have dismissed them with horror but now they are very clear andcertain i write all this to you dear friend only to convince you ofthe gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life not asingle hair of our heads will fall without his will and his will isgoverned only by infinite love for us and so whatever befalls us is forour goodyou ask whether we shall spend next winter in moscow in spite of mywish to see you i do not think so and do not want to do so you will besurprised to hear that the reason for this is buonaparte the case isthis my fathers health is growing noticeably worse he cannot standany contradiction and is becoming irritable this irritability is asyou know chiefly directed to political questions he cannot endure thenotion that buonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all thesovereigns of europe and particularly with our own the grandson of thegreat catherine as you know i am quite indifferent to politics butfrom my fathers remarks and his talks with michael ivanovich i know allthat goes on in the world and especially about the honors conferred onbuonaparte who only at bald hills in the whole world it seems is notaccepted as a great man still less as emperor of france and my fathercannot stand this it seems to me that it is chiefly because of hispolitical views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to moscowfor he foresees the encounters that would result from his way ofexpressing his views regardless of anybody all the benefit he mightderive from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of thedisputes about buonaparte which would be inevitable in any case it willbe decided very shortlyour family life goes on in the old way except for my brother andrewsabsence he as i wrote you before has changed very much of late afterhis sorrow he only this year quite recovered his spirits he has againbecome as i used to know him when a child kind affectionate with thatheart of gold to which i know no equal he has realized it seems to methat life is not over for him but together with this mental change hehas grown physically much weaker he has become thinner and morenervous i am anxious about him and glad he is taking this trip abroadwhich the doctors recommended long ago i hope it will cure him youwrite that in petersburg he is spoken of as one of the most activecultivated and capable of the young men forgive my vanity as arelation but i never doubted it the good he has done to everybodyhere from his peasants up to the gentry is incalculable on hisarrival in petersburg he received only his due i always wonder at theway rumors fly from petersburg to moscow especially such false ones asthat you write abouti mean the report of my brothers betrothal to thelittle rostova i do not think my brother will ever marry again andcertainly not her and this is why first i know that though he rarelyspeaks about the wife he has lost the grief of that loss has gone toodeep in his heart for him ever to decide to give her a successor and ourlittle angel a stepmother secondly because as far as i know that girlis not the kind of girl who could please prince andrew i do not thinkhe would choose her for a wife and frankly i do not wish it but i amrunning on too long and am at the end of my second sheet goodbye mydear friend may god keep you in his holy and mighty care my dearfriend mademoiselle bourienne sends you kissesmaryin the middle of the summer princess mary received an unexpected letterfrom prince andrew in switzerland in which he gave her strange andsurprising news he informed her of his engagement to natasha rostovathe whole letter breathed loving rapture for his betrothed and tenderand confiding affection for his sister he wrote that he had never lovedas he did now and that only now did he understand and know what lifewas he asked his sister to forgive him for not having told her of hisresolve when he had last visited bald hills though he had spoken of itto his father he had not done so for fear princess mary should ask herfather to give his consent irritating him and having to bear the bruntof his displeasure without attaining her object besides he wrotethe matter was not then so definitely settled as it is now my fatherthen insisted on a delay of a year and now already six months half ofthat period have passed and my resolution is firmer than ever if thedoctors did not keep me here at the spas i should be back in russia butas it is i have to postpone my return for three months you know me andmy relations with father i want nothing from him i have been andalways shall be independent but to go against his will and arouse hisanger now that he may perhaps remain with us such a short time woulddestroy half my happiness i am now writing to him about the samequestion and beg you to choose a good moment to hand him the letter andto let me know how he looks at the whole matter and whether there ishope that he may consent to reduce the term by four monthsafter long hesitations doubts and prayers princess mary gave theletter to her father the next day the old prince said to her quietlywrite and tell your brother to wait till i am dead it wont belongi shall soon set him freethe princess was about to reply but her father would not let her speakand raising his voice more and more criedmarry marry my boy a good family clever people eh rich ehyes a nice stepmother little nicholas will have write and tell himthat he may marry tomorrow if he likes she will be little nicholasstepmother and ill marry bourienne ha ha ha he mustnt bewithout a stepmother either only one thing no more women are wanted inmy houselet him marry and live by himself perhaps you will go andlive with him too he added turning to princess mary go in heavensname go out into the frost the frost the frostafter this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the matterbut repressed vexation at his sons poorspirited behavior foundexpression in his treatment of his daughter to his former pretexts forirony a fresh one was now addedallusions to stepmothers andamiabilities to mademoiselle bouriennewhy shouldnt i marry her he asked his daughter shell make asplendid princessand latterly to her surprise and bewilderment princess mary noticedthat her father was really associating more and more with thefrenchwoman she wrote to prince andrew about the reception of hisletter but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to theidealittle nicholas and his education her brother andrew and religion wereprincess marys joys and consolations but besides that since everyonemust have personal hopes princess mary in the profoundest depths of herheart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the chief consolation ofher life this comforting dream and hope were given her by gods folkthe halfwitted and other pilgrims who visited her without the princesknowledge the longer she lived the more experience and observation shehad of life the greater was her wonder at the shortsightedness of menwho seek enjoyment and happiness here on earth toiling sufferingstruggling and harming one another to obtain that impossiblevisionary sinful happiness prince andrew had loved his wife she diedbut that was not enough he wanted to bind his happiness to anotherwoman her father objected to this because he wanted a moredistinguished and wealthier match for andrew and they all struggled andsuffered and tormented one another and injured their souls theireternal souls for the attainment of benefits which endure but for aninstant not only do we know this ourselves but christ the son of godcame down to earth and told us that this life is but for a moment and isa probation yet we cling to it and think to find happiness in it howis it that no one realizes this thought princess mary no one exceptthese despised gods folk who wallet on back come to me by the backdoor afraid of being seen by the prince not for fear of illusage byhim but for fear of causing him to sin to leave family home and allthe cares of worldly welfare in order without clinging to anything towander in hempen rags from place to place under an assumed name doingno one any harm but praying for allfor those who drive one away aswell as for those who protect one higher than that life and truth thereis no life or truththere was one pilgrim a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty calledtheodosia who for over thirty years had gone about barefoot and wornheavy chains princess mary was particularly fond of her once when ina room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon theodosia was talking ofher life the thought that theodosia alone had found the true path oflife suddenly came to princess mary with such force that she resolved tobecome a pilgrim herself when theodosia had gone to sleep princess marythought about this for a long time and at last made up her mind thatstrange as it might seem she must go on a pilgrimage she disclosedthis thought to no one but to her confessor father akinfi the monkand he approved of her intention under guise of a present for thepilgrims princess mary prepared a pilgrims complete costume forherself a coarse smock bast shoes a rough coat and a black kerchiefoften approaching the chest of drawers containing this secret treasureprincess mary paused uncertain whether the time had not already come toput her project into executionoften listening to the pilgrims tales she was so stimulated by theirsimple speech mechanical to them but to her so full of deep meaningthat several times she was on the point of abandoning everything andrunning away from home in imagination she already pictured herself bytheodosias side dressed in coarse rags walking with a staff a walleton her back along the dusty road directing her wanderings from onesaints shrine to another free from envy earthly love or desire andreaching at last the place where there is no more sorrow or sighing buteternal joy and blissi shall come to a place and pray there and before having time to getused to it or getting to love it i shall go farther i will go on tillmy legs fail and ill lie down and die somewhere and shall at lastreach that eternal quiet haven where there is neither sorrow norsighing thought princess marybut afterwards when she saw her father and especially little kokonicholas her resolve weakened she wept quietly and felt that shewas a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than godthe bible legend tells us that the absence of laboridlenesswas acondition of the first mans blessedness before the fall fallen man hasretained a love of idleness but the curse weighs on the race not onlybecause we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows but becauseour moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at ease aninner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle if man couldfind a state in which he felt that though idle he was fulfilling hisduty he would have found one of the conditions of mans primitiveblessedness and such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idlenessis the lot of a whole classthe military the chief attraction ofmilitary service has consisted and will consist in this compulsory andirreproachable idlenessnicholas rostov experienced this blissful condition to the full whenafter  he continued to serve in the pavlograd regiment in which healready commanded the squadron he had taken over from denisovrostov had become a bluff goodnatured fellow whom his moscowacquaintances would have considered rather bad form but who was likedand respected by his comrades subordinates and superiors and was wellcontented with his life of late in  he found in letters from homemore frequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were fallinginto greater and greater disorder and that it was time for him to comeback to gladden and comfort his old parentsreading these letters nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to takehim away from surroundings in which protected from all theentanglements of life he was living so calmly and quietly he felt thatsooner or later he would have to reenter that whirlpool of life withits embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out its accounts withstewards quarrels and intrigues its ties society and with sonyaslove and his promise to her it was all dreadfully difficult andcomplicated and he replied to his mother in cold formal letters infrench beginning my dear mamma and ending your obedient sonwhich said nothing of when he would return in  he received lettersfrom his parents in which they told him of natashas engagement tobolkonski and that the wedding would be in a years time because theold prince made difficulties this letter grieved and mortifiednicholas in the first place he was sorry that natasha for whom hecared more than for anyone else in the family should be lost to thehome and secondly from his hussar point of view he regretted not tohave been there to show that fellow bolkonski that connection with himwas no such great honor after all and that if he loved natasha he mightdispense with permission from his dotard father for a moment hehesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see natashabefore she was married but then came the maneuvers and considerationsabout sonya and about the confusion of their affairs and nicholas againput it off but in the spring of that year he received a letter fromhis mother written without his fathers knowledge and that letterpersuaded him to return she wrote that if he did not come and takematters in hand their whole property would be sold by auction and theywould all have to go begging the count was so weak and trusted mitenkaso much and was so goodnatured that everybody took advantage of himand things were going from bad to worse for gods sake i implore youcome at once if you do not wish to make me and the whole familywretched wrote the countessthis letter touched nicholas he had that common sense of a matteroffact man which showed him what he ought to dothe right thing now was if not to retire from the service at any rateto go home on leave why he had to go he did not know but after hisafterdinner nap he gave orders to saddle mars an extremely viciousgray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time and when hereturned with the horse all in a lather he informed lavrushkadenisovs servant who had remained with him and his comrades whoturned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was goinghome difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he wouldgo away without having heard from the staffand this interested himextremelywhether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive theorder of st anne for the last maneuvers strange as it was to thinkthat he would go away without having sold his three roans to the polishcount golukhovski who was bargaining for the horses rostov had bettedhe would sell for two thousand rubles incomprehensible as it seemedthat the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the polishmademoiselle przazdziecka out of rivalry to the uhlans who had givenone in honor of their polish mademoiselle borzozowska would take placewithout himhe knew he must go away from this good bright world tosomewhere where everything was stupid and confused a week later heobtained his leave his hussar comradesnot only those of his ownregiment but the whole brigadegave rostov a dinner to which thesubscription was fifteen rubles a head and at which there were twobands and two choirs of singers rostov danced the trepak with majorbasov the tipsy officers tossed embraced and dropped rostov thesoldiers of the third squadron tossed him too and shouted hurrah andthen they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the firstpost stationduring the first half of the journeyfrom kremenchug to kievallrostovs thoughts as is usual in such cases were behind him with thesquadron but when he had gone more than halfway he began to forget histhree roans and dozhoyveyko his quartermaster and to wonder anxiouslyhow things would be at otradnoe and what he would find there thoughtsof home grew stronger the nearer he approached itfar stronger asthough this feeling of his was subject to the law by which the force ofattraction is in inverse proportion to the square of the distance atthe last post station before otradnoe he gave the driver a threerubletip and on arriving he ran breathlessly like a boy up the steps ofhis homeafter the rapture of meeting and after that odd feeling of unsatisfiedexpectationthe feeling that everything is just the same so why did ihurrynicholas began to settle down in his old home world his fatherand mother were much the same only a little older what was new in themwas a certain uneasiness and occasional discord which there used not tobe and which as nicholas soon found out was due to the bad state oftheir affairs sonya was nearly twenty she had stopped growing prettierand promised nothing more than she was already but that was enough sheexhaled happiness and love from the time nicholas returned and thefaithful unalterable love of this girl had a gladdening effect on himpetya and natasha surprised nicholas most petya was a big handsome boyof thirteen merry witty and mischievous with a voice that wasalready breaking as for natasha for a long while nicholas wondered andlaughed whenever he looked at heryoure not the same at all he saidhow am i uglieron the contrary but what dignity a princess he whispered to heryes yes yes cried natasha joyfullyshe told him about her romance with prince andrew and of his visit tootradnoe and showed him his last letterwell are you glad natasha asked i am so tranquil and happy nowvery glad answered nicholas he is an excellent fellow and areyou very much in lovehow shall i put it replied natasha i was in love with boris withmy teacher and with denisov but this is quite different i feel atpeace and settled i know that no better man than he exists and i amcalm and contented now not at all as beforenicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the marriagefor a year but natasha attacked her brother with exasperation provingto him that it could not be otherwise and that it would be a bad thingto enter a family against the fathers will and that she herself wishedit soyou dont at all understand she saidnicholas was silent and agreed with herher brother often wondered as he looked at her she did not seem at alllike a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband she was eventempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old this amazed nicholasand even made him regard bolkonskis courtship skeptically he could notbelieve that her fate was sealed especially as he had not seen her withprince andrew it always seemed to him that there was something notquite right about this intended marriagewhy this delay why no betrothal he thought once when he hadtouched on this topic with his mother he discovered to his surpriseand somewhat to his satisfaction that in the depth of her soul she toohad doubts about this marriageyou see he writes said she showing her son a letter of princeandrews with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to adaughters future married happiness he writes that he wont comebefore december what can be keeping him illness probably his healthis very delicate dont tell natasha and dont attach importance to herbeing so bright thats because shes living through the last days ofher girlhood but i know what she is like every time we receive a letterfrom him however god grant that everything turns out well shealways ended with these words he is an excellent manafter reaching home nicholas was at first serious and even dull he wasworried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid businessmatters for which his mother had called him home to throw off thisburden as quickly as possible on the third day after his arrival hewent angry and scowling and without answering questions as to where hewas going to mitenkas lodge and demanded an account of everything butwhat an account of everything might be nicholas knew even less than thefrightened and bewildered mitenka the conversation and the examinationof the accounts with mitenka did not last long the village elder apeasant delegate and the village clerk who were waiting in thepassage heard with fear and delight first the young counts voiceroaring and snapping and rising louder and louder and then words ofabuse dreadful words ejaculated one after the otherrobber ungrateful wretch ill hack the dog to pieces im notmy father robbing us and so onthen with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count red inthe face and with bloodshot eyes dragged mitenka out by the scruff ofthe neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great agilityat convenient moments between the words shouting be off never let mesee your face here again you villainmitenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into theshrubbery this shrubbery was a wellknown haven of refuge for culpritsat otradnoe mitenka himself returning tipsy from the town used tohide there and many of the residents at otradnoe hiding from mitenkaknew of its protective qualitiesmitenkas wife and sistersinlaw thrust their heads and frightenedfaces out of the door of a room where a bright samovar was boiling andwhere the stewards high bedstead stood with its patchwork quiltthe young count paid no heed to them but breathing hard passed bywith resolute strides and went into the housethe countess who heard at once from the maids what had happened at thelodge was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would certainlyimprove but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect thisexcitement might have on her son she went several times to his door ontiptoe and listened as he lighted one pipe after anothernext day the old count called his son aside and with an embarrassedsmile said to himbut you know my dear boy its a pity you got excited mitenka hastold me all about iti knew thought nicholas that i should never understand anything inthis crazy worldyou were angry that he had not entered those  rubles but they werecarried forwardand you did not look at the other pagepapa he is a blackguard and a thief i know he is and what i havedone i have done but if you like i wont speak to him againno my dear boy the count too felt embarrassed he knew he hadmismanaged his wifes property and was to blame toward his children buthe did not know how to remedy it no i beg you to attend to thebusiness i am old ino papa forgive me if i have caused you unpleasantness i understandit all less than you dodevil take all these peasants and money matters and carryings forwardfrom page to page he thought i used to understand what a cornerand the stakes at cards meant but carrying forward to another page idont understand at all said he to himself and after that he did notmeddle in business affairs but once the countess called her son andinformed him that she had a promissory note from anna mikhaylovna fortwo thousand rubles and asked him what he thought of doing with itthis answered nicholas you say it rests with me well i dont likeanna mikhaylovna and i dont like boris but they were our friends andpoor well then this and he tore up the note and by so doing causedthe old countess to weep tears of joy after that young rostov took nofurther part in any business affairs but devoted himself withpassionate enthusiasm to what was to him a new pursuitthe chaseforwhich his father kept a large establishmentthe weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts congealed anearth saturated by autumn rains the verdure had thickened and itsbright green stood out sharply against the brownish strips of winter ryetrodden down by the cattle and against the paleyellow stubble of thespring buckwheat the wooded ravines and the copses which at the end ofaugust had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble hadbecome golden and brightred islands amid the green winter rye thehares had already half changed their summer coats the fox cubs werebeginning to scatter and the young wolves were bigger than dogs it wasthe best time of the year for the chase the hounds of that ardent youngsportsman rostov had not merely reached hard winter condition but wereso jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them athree days rest and then on the sixteenth of september to go on adistant expedition starting from the oak grove where there was anundisturbed litter of wolf cubsall that day the hounds remained at home it was frosty and the air wassharp but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began to thawon the fifteenth when young rostov in his dressing gown looked out ofthe window he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting it wasas if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any windthe only motion in the air was that of the dripping microscopicparticles of drizzling mist the bare twigs in the garden were hung withtransparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves the earth inthe kitchen garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seedand at a short distance merged into the dull moist veil of mistnicholas went out into the wet and muddy porch there was a smell ofdecaying leaves and of dog milka a blackspotted broadhaunched bitchwith prominent black eyes got up on seeing her master stretched herhind legs lay down like a hare and then suddenly jumped up and lickedhim right on his nose and mustache another borzoi a dog catchingsight of his master from the garden path arched his back and rushingheadlong toward the porch with lifted tail began rubbing himselfagainst his legsohoy came at that moment that inimitable huntsmans call whichunites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor and round the cornercame daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman a gray wrinkled oldman with hair cut straight over his forehead ukrainian fashion a longbent whip in his hand and that look of independence and scorn ofeverything that is only seen in huntsmen he doffed his circassian capto his master and looked at him scornfully this scorn was not offensiveto his master nicholas knew that this daniel disdainful of everybodyand who considered himself above them was all the same his serf andhuntsmandaniel nicholas said timidly conscious at the sight of the weatherthe hounds and the huntsman that he was being carried away by thatirresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all his previousresolutions as a lover forgets in the presence of his mistresswhat orders your excellency said the huntsman in his deep bass deepas a protodeacons and hoarse with hallooingand two flashing blackeyes gazed from under his brows at his master who was silent can youresist it those eyes seemed to be askingits a good day eh for a hunt and a gallop eh asked nicholasscratching milka behind the earsdaniel did not answer but winked insteadi sent uvarka at dawn to listen his bass boomed out after a minutespause he says shes moved them into the otradnoe enclosure they werehowling there this meant that the shewolf about whom they bothknew had moved with her cubs to the otradnoe copse a small place amile and a half from the housewe ought to go dont you think so said nicholas come to me withuvarkaas you pleasethen put off feeding themyes sirfive minutes later daniel and uvarka were standing in nicholas bigstudy though daniel was not a big man to see him in a room was likeseeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture andsurroundings of human life daniel himself felt this and as usual stoodjust inside the door trying to speak softly and not move for fear ofbreaking something in the masters apartment and he hastened to say allthat was necessary so as to get from under that ceiling out into theopen under the sky once morehaving finished his inquiries and extorted from daniel an opinion thatthe hounds were fit daniel himself wished to go hunting nicholasordered the horses to be saddled but just as daniel was about to gonatasha came in with rapid steps not having done up her hair orfinished dressing and with her old nurses big shawl wrapped round herpetya ran in at the same timeyou are going asked natasha i knew you would sonya said youwouldnt go but i knew that today is the sort of day when you couldnthelp goingyes we are going replied nicholas reluctantly for today as heintended to hunt seriously he did not want to take natasha and petyawe are going but only wolf hunting it would be dull for youyou know it is my greatest pleasure said natasha its not fair youare going by yourself are having the horses saddled and said nothing tous about itno barrier bars a russians pathwell go shouted petyabut you cant mamma said you mustnt said nicholas to natashayes ill go i shall certainly go said natasha decisively danieltell them to saddle for us and michael must come with my dogs sheadded to the huntsmanit seemed to daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all but tohave anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible he castdown his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his businesscareful as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on the youngladythe old count who had always kept up an enormous hunting establishmentbut had now handed it all completely over to his sons care being invery good spirits on this fifteenth of september prepared to go outwith the othersin an hours time the whole hunting party was at the porch nicholaswith a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time forattending to trifles went past natasha and petya who were trying totell him something he had a look at all the details of the hunt sent apack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the quarry mounted hischestnut donets and whistling to his own leash of borzois set offacross the threshing ground to a field leading to the otradnoe wood theold counts horse a sorrel gelding called viflyanka was led by thegroom in attendance on him while the count himself was to drive in asmall trap straight to a spot reserved for himthey were taking fiftyfour hounds with six hunt attendants andwhippersin besides the family there were eight borzoi kennelmen andmore than forty

huntsmen had not yet reached their places when countilya rostov cheerful flushed and with quivering cheeks drove up withhis black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for himwhere a wolf might come out having straightened his coat and fastenedon his hunting knives and horn he mounted his good sleek wellfedand comfortable horse viflyanka which was turning gray like himselfhis horses and trap were sent home count ilya rostov though not atheart a keen sportsman knew the rules of the hunt well and rode to thebushy edge of the road where he was to stand arranged his reinssettled himself in the saddle and feeling that he was ready lookedabout with a smilebeside him was simon chekmar his personal attendant an old horsemannow somewhat stiff in the saddle chekmar held in leash three formidablewolfhounds who had however grown fat like their master and his horsetwo wise old dogs lay down unleashed some hundred paces farther alongthe edge of the wood stood mitka the counts other groom a daringhorseman and keen rider to hounds before the hunt by old custom thecount had drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy taken a snack andwashed it down with half a bottle of his favorite bordeauxhe was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive his eyes wererather moist and glittered more than usual and as he sat in his saddlewrapped up in his fur coat he looked like a child taken out for anoutingthe thin hollowcheeked chekmar having got everything ready keptglancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of terms forthirty years and understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasantchat a third person rode up circumspectly through the wood it wasplain that he had had a lesson and stopped behind the count thisperson was a graybearded old man in a womans cloak with a tall peakedcap on his head he was the buffoon who went by a womans namenastasya ivanovnawell nastasya ivanovna whispered the count winking at him if youscare away the beast

fearful place what a sightwhen they rushed from the covert the horse worth a thousand rublesand the rider beyond all price yes one would have to search far tofind another as smartto search far repeated the count evidently sorry simon had notsaid more to search far he said turning back the skirt of his coatto get at his snuffboxthe other day when he came out from mass in full uniform michaelsidorych simon did not finish for on the still air he haddistinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three houndsgiving tongue he bent down his head and listened shaking a warningfinger at his master they are on the scent of the cubs hewhispered straight to the lyadov uplandsthe count forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face looked intothe distance straight before him down the narrow open space holdingthe snuffbox in his hand but not taking any after the cry of the houndscame the deep tones of the wolf call from daniels hunting horn thepack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full crywith that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after awolf the whippersin no longer set on the hounds but changed to thecry of ulyulyu and above the others rose daniels voice now a deepbass now piercingly shrill his voice seemed to fill the whole wood andcarried far beyond out into the open fieldafter listening a few moments in silence the count and his attendantconvinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs thesound of the larger pack eagerly giving tongue began to die away inthe distance the other pack rushed by the wood past the count and itwas with this that daniels voice was heard calling ulyulyu the soundsof both packs mingled and broke apart again but both were becoming moredistantsimon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi hadentangled the count too sighed and noticing the snuffbox in his handopened it and took a pinch back cried simon to a borzoi that waspushing forward out of the wood the count started and dropped thesnuffbox nastasya ivanovna dismounted to pick it up the count andsimon were looking at himthen unexpectedly as often happens the sound of the hunt suddenlyapproached as if the hounds in full cry and daniel ulyulyuing were justin front of themthe count turned and saw on his right mitka staring at him with eyesstarting out of his head raising his cap and pointing before him to theother sidelook out he shouted in a voice plainly showing that he had longfretted to utter that word and letting the borzois slip he gallopedtoward the countthe count and simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left awolf which softly swaying from side to side was coming at a quiet lopefarther to the left to the very place where they were standing theangry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past thehorses feet at the wolfthe wolf paused turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardlylike a man suffering from the quinsy and still slightly swaying fromside to side gave a couple of leaps and with a swish of its taildisappeared into the skirt of the wood at the same instant with a crylike a wail first one hound then another and then another spranghelterskelter from the wood opposite and the whole pack rushed acrossthe field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared the hazelbushes parted behind the hounds and daniels chestnut horse appeareddark with sweat on its long back sat daniel hunched forward caplesshis disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed perspiring faceulyulyulyu ulyulyu he cried when he caught sight of the counthis eyes flashed lightningblast you he shouted holding up his whip threateningly at the countyouve let the wolf go what sportsmen and as if scorning to saymore to the frightened and shamefaced count he lashed the heavingflanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count hadaroused and flew off after the hounds the count like a punishedschoolboy looked round trying by a smile to win simons sympathy forhis plight but simon was no longer there he was galloping round by thebushes while the field was coming up on both sides all trying to headthe wolf but it vanished into the wood before they could do sonicholas rostov meanwhile remained at his post waiting for the wolf bythe way the hunt approached and receded by the cries of the dogs whosenotes were familiar to him by the way the voices of the huntsmenapproached receded and rose he realized what was happening at thecopse he knew that young and old wolves were there that the hounds hadseparated into two packs that somewhere a wolf was being chased andthat something had gone wrong he expected the wolf to come his way anymoment he made thousands of different conjectures as to where and fromwhat side the beast would come and how he would set upon it hopealternated with despair several times he addressed a prayer to god thatthe wolf should come his way he prayed with that passionate andshamefaced feeling with which men pray at moments of great excitementarising from trivial causes what would it be to thee to do this forme he said to god i know thou art great and that it is a sin to askthis of thee but for gods sake do let the old wolf come my way and letkaray spring at itin sight of uncle who is watching from over thereand seize it by the throat in a death grip a thousand times duringthat halfhour rostov cast eager and restless glances over the edge ofthe wood with the two scraggy oaks rising above the aspen undergrowthand the gully with its waterworn side and uncles cap just visibleabove the bush on his rightno i shant have such luck thought rostov yet what wouldnt it beworth it is not to be everywhere at cards and in war i am alwaysunlucky memories of austerlitz and of dolokhov flashed rapidly andclearly through his mind only once in my life to get an old wolf iwant only that thought he straining eyes and ears and looking to theleft and then to the right and listening to the slightest variation ofnote in the cries of the dogsagain he looked to the right and saw something running toward him acrossthe deserted field no it cant be thought rostov taking a deepbreath as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for theheight of happiness was reachedand so simply without warning ornoise or display that rostov could not believe his eyes and remainedin doubt for over a second the wolf ran forward and jumped heavily overa gully that lay in her path she was an old animal with a gray back andbig reddish belly she ran without hurry evidently feeling sure that noone saw her rostov holding his breath looked round at the borzoisthey stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situationold karay had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleasbaring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legsulyulyulyu whispered rostov pouting his lips the borzois jumped upjerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears karay finishedscratching his hindquarters and cocking his ears got up with quiveringtail from which tufts of matted hair hung downshall i loose them or not nicholas asked himself as the wolfapproached him coming from the copse suddenly the wolfs wholephysiognomy changed she shuddered seeing what she had probably neverseen beforehuman eyes fixed upon herand turning her head a littletoward rostov she pausedback or forward eh no matter forward the wolf seemed to say toherself and she moved forward without again looking round and with aquiet long easy yet resolute lopeulyulyu cried nicholas in a voice not his own and of its own accordhis good horse darted headlong downhill leaping over gullies to headoff the wolf and the borzois passed it running faster still nicholasdid not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping nor see theborzois nor the ground over which he went he saw only the wolf whoincreasing her speed bounded on in the same direction along the hollowthe first to come into view was milka with her black markings andpowerful quarters gaining upon the wolf nearer and nearer now shewas ahead of it but the wolf turned its head to face her and insteadof putting on speed as she usually did milka suddenly raised her tailand stiffened her forelegsulyulyulyulyu shouted nicholasthe reddish lyubim rushed forward from behind milka sprang impetuouslyat the wolf and seized it by its hindquarters but immediately jumpedaside in terror the wolf crouched gnashed her teeth and again roseand bounded forward followed at the distance of a couple of feet by allthe borzois who did not get any closer to hershell get away no its impossible thought nicholas still shoutingwith a hoarse voicekaray ulyulyu he shouted looking round for the old borzoi whowas now his only hope karay with all the strength age had left himstretched himself to the utmost and watching the wolf galloped heavilyaside to intercept it but the quickness of the wolfs lope and theborzois slower pace made it plain that karay had miscalculatednicholas could already see not far in front of him the wood where thewolf would certainly escape should she reach it but coming toward himhe saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost straight at the wolfthere was still hope a long yellowish young borzoi one nicholas didnot know from another leash rushed impetuously at the wolf from infront and almost knocked her over but the wolf jumped up more quicklythan anyone could have expected and gnashing her teeth flew at theyellowish borzoi which with a piercing yelp fell with its head on theground bleeding from a gash in its sidekaray old fellow wailed nicholasthanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolfs path the olddog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five paces ofit as if aware of her danger the wolf turned her eyes on karay tuckedher tail yet further between her legs and increased her speed but herenicholas only saw that something happened to karaythe borzoi wassuddenly on the wolf and they rolled together down into a gully just infront of themthat instant when nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully withthe dogs while from under them could be seen her gray hair andoutstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head with her earslaid back karay was pinning her by the throat was the happiest momentof his life with his hand on his saddlebow he was ready to dismountand stab the wolf when she suddenly thrust her head up from among thatmass of dogs and then her forepaws were on the edge of the gully sheclicked her teeth karay no longer had her by the throat leaped with amovement of her hind legs out of the gully and having disengagedherself from the dogs with tail tucked in again went forward karayhis hair bristling and probably bruised or wounded climbed withdifficulty out of the gullyoh my god why nicholas cried in despairuncles huntsman was galloping from the other side across the wolfspath and his borzois once more stopped the animals advance she wasagain hemmed innicholas and his attendant with uncle and his huntsman were allriding round the wolf crying ulyulyu shouting and preparing todismount each moment that the wolf crouched back and starting forwardagain every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where shewould be safealready at the beginning of this chase daniel hearing the ulyulyuinghad rushed out from the wood he saw karay seize the wolf and checkedhis horse supposing the affair to be over but when he saw that thehorsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself and ran forsafety daniel set his chestnut galloping not at the wolf but straighttoward the wood just as karay had run to cut the animal off as aresult of this he galloped up to the wolf just when she had beenstopped a second time by uncles borzoisdaniel galloped up silently holding a naked dagger in his left hand andthrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as ifit were a flailnicholas neither saw nor heard daniel until the chestnut breathingheavily panted past him and he heard the fall of a body and saw daniellying on the wolfs back among the dogs trying to seize her by theears it was evident to the dogs the hunters and to the wolf herselfthat all was now over the terrified wolf pressed back her ears andtried to rise but the borzois stuck to her daniel rose a little tooka step and with his whole weight as if lying down to rest fell on thewolf seizing her by the ears nicholas was about to stab her butdaniel whispered dont well gag her and changing his positionset his foot on the wolfs neck a stick was thrust between her jaws andshe was fastened with a leash as if bridled her legs were boundtogether and daniel rolled her over once or twice from side to sidewith happy exhausted faces they laid the old wolf alive on a shyingand snorting horse and accompanied by the dogs yelping at her took herto the place where they were all to meet the hounds had killed two ofthe cubs and the borzois three the huntsmen assembled with their bootyand their stories and all came to look at the wolf which with herbroadbrowed head hanging down and the bitten stick between her jawsgazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and men surroundingher when she was touched she jerked her bound legs and looked wildlyyet simply at everybody old count rostov also rode up and touched thewolfoh what a formidable one said he a formidable one eh he askeddaniel who was standing nearyes your excellency answered daniel quickly doffing his capthe count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter withdanielah but you are a crusty fellow friend said the countfor sole reply daniel gave him a shy childlike meek and amiablesmilethe old count went home and natasha and petya promised to return verysoon but as it was still early the hunt went farther at midday theyput the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young treesnicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whipsfacing him lay a field of winter rye there his own huntsman stood alonein a hollow behind a hazel bush the hounds had scarcely been loosedbefore nicholas heard one he knew voltorn giving tongue at intervalsother hounds joined in now pausing and now again giving tongue amoment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a fox had beenfound and the whole pack joining together rushed along the ravinetoward the ryefield and away from nicholashe saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of theravine he even saw the hounds and was expecting a fox to show itselfat any moment on the ryefield oppositethe huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois andnicholas saw a queer shortlegged red fox with a fine brush going hardacross the field the borzois bore down on it now they drew close tothe fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharpercurves trailing its brush when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashedin followed by a black one and everything was in confusion the borzoisformed a starshaped figure scarcely swaying their bodies and withtails turned away from the center of the group two huntsmen galloped upto the dogs one in a red cap the other a stranger in a green coatwhats this thought nicholas wheres that huntsman from he is notuncles manthe huntsmen got the fox but stayed there a long time without strappingit to the saddle their horses bridled and with high saddles stoodnear them and there too the dogs were lying the huntsmen waved theirarms and did something to the fox then from that spot came the sound ofa horn with the signal agreed on in case of a fightthats ilagins huntsman having a row with our ivan said nicholasgroomnicholas sent the man to call natasha and petya to him and rode at afootpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds togetherseveral of the field galloped to the spot where the fight was going onnicholas dismounted and with natasha and petya who had ridden upstopped near the hounds waiting to see how the matter would end out ofthe bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward hisyoung master with the fox tied to his crupper while still at adistance he took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully but he waspale and breathless and his face was angry one of his eyes was blackbut he probably was not even aware of itwhat has happened asked nicholasa likely thing killing a fox our dogs had hunted and it was my graybitch that caught it go to law indeed he snatches at the fox igave him one with the fox here it is on my saddle do you want a tasteof this said the huntsman pointing to his dagger and probablyimagining himself still speaking to his foenicholas not stopping to talk to the man asked his sister and petya towait for him and rode to the spot where the enemys ilagins huntingparty wasthe victorious huntsman rode off to join the field and theresurrounded by inquiring sympathizers recounted his exploitsthe facts were that ilagin with whom the rostovs had a quarrel and wereat law hunted over places that belonged by custom to the rostovs andhad now as if purposely sent his men to the very woods the rostovswere hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had chasednicholas though he had never seen ilagin with his usual absence ofmoderation in judgment hated him cordially from reports of hisarbitrariness and violence and regarded him as his bitterest foe herode in angry agitation toward him firmly grasping his whip and fullyprepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish hisenemyhardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in abeaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome ravenblack horseaccompanied by two hunt servantsinstead of an enemy nicholas found in ilagin a stately and courteousgentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young countsacquaintance having ridden up to nicholas ilagin raised his beaver capand said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the manpunished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone elsesborzois he hoped to become better acquainted with the count and invitedhim to draw his covertnatasha afraid that her brother would do something dreadful hadfollowed him in some excitement seeing the enemies exchanging friendlygreetings she rode up to them ilagin lifted his beaver cap stillhigher to natasha and said with a pleasant smile that the youngcountess resembled diana in her passion for the chase as well as in herbeauty of which he had heard muchto expiate his huntsmans offense ilagin pressed the rostovs to come toan upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for himself andwhich he said swarmed with hares nicholas agreed and the hunt nowdoubled moved onthe way to iligins upland was across the fields the hunt servants fellinto line the masters rode together uncle rostov and ilagin keptstealthily glancing at one anothers dogs trying not to be observed bytheir companions and searching uneasily for rivals to their own borzoisrostov was particularly struck by the beauty of a small purebred redspotted bitch on ilagins leash slender but with muscles like steel adelicate muzzle and prominent black eyes he had heard of the swiftnessof ilagins borzois and in that beautiful bitch saw a rival to his ownmilkain the middle of a sober conversation begun by ilagin about the yearsharvest nicholas pointed to the redspotted bitcha fine little bitch that said he in a careless tone is she swiftthat one yes shes a good dog gets what shes after answeredilagin indifferently of the redspotted bitch erza for which a yearbefore he had given a neighbor three families of house serfs so inyour parts too the harvest is nothing to boast of count he went oncontinuing the conversation they had begun and considering it polite toreturn the young counts compliment ilagin looked at his borzois andpicked out milka who attracted his attention by her breadth thatblackspotted one of yours is finewell shaped said heyes shes fast enough replied nicholas and thought if only afullgrown hare would cross the field now id show you what sort ofborzoi she is and turning to his groom he said he would give a rubleto anyone who found a harei dont understand continued ilagin how some sportsmen can be sojealous about game and dogs for myself i can tell you count i enjoyriding in company such as this what could be better he againraised his cap to natasha but as for counting skins and what onetakes i dont care about thatof course notor being upset because someone elses borzoi and not mine catchessomething all i care about is to enjoy seeing the chase is it not socount for i consider thatatu came the longdrawn cry of one of the borzoi whippersin whohad halted he stood on a knoll in the stubble holding his whip aloftand again repeated his longdrawn cry atu this call and theuplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hareah he has found one i think said ilagin carelessly yes we mustride up shall we both course it answered nicholas seeing in erzaand uncles red rugay two rivals he had never yet had a chance ofpitting against his own borzois and suppose they outdo my milka atonce he thought as he rode with uncle and ilagin toward the harea fullgrown one asked ilagin as he approached the whip who hadsighted the hareand not without agitation he looked round and whistledto erzaand you michael nikanorovich he said addressing unclethe latter was riding with a sullen expression on his facehow can i join in why youve given a village for each of yourborzois thats it come on yours are worth thousands try yoursagainst one another you two and ill look onrugay hey hey he shouted rugayushka he added involuntarily bythis diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes he placed on thisred borzoi natasha saw and felt the agitation the two elderly men andher brother were trying to conceal and was herself excited by itthe huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and thegentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace the hounds that were far off onthe horizon turned away from the hare and the whips but not thegentlefolk also moved away all were moving slowly and sedatelyhow is it pointing asked nicholas riding a hundred paces toward thewhip who had sighted the harebut before the whip could reply the hare scenting the frost comingnext morning was unable to rest and leaped up the pack on leash rusheddownhill in full cry after the hare and from all sides the borzois thatwere not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare all the huntwho had been moving slowly shouted stop calling in the houndswhile the borzoi whips with a cry of atu galloped across the fieldsetting the borzois on the hare the tranquil ilagin nicholas natashaand uncle flew reckless of where and how they went seeing only theborzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight even for an instantof the chase the hare they had started was a strong and swift one whenhe jumped up he did not run at once but pricked his ears listening tothe shouting and trampling that resounded from all sides at once hetook a dozen bounds not very quickly letting the borzois gain on himand finally having chosen his direction and realized his danger laidback his ears and rushed off headlong he had been lying in the stubblebut in front of him was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft thetwo borzois of the huntsman who had sighted him having been thenearest were the first to see and pursue him but they had not gone farbefore ilagins redspotted erza passed them got within a length flewat the hare with terrible swiftness aiming at his scut and thinkingshe had seized him rolled over like a ball the hare arched his backand bounded off yet more swiftly from behind erza rushed the broadhaunched blackspotted milka and began rapidly gaining on the haremilashka dear rose nicholas triumphant cry it looked as if milkawould immediately pounce on the hare but she overtook him and flewpast the hare had squatted again the beautiful erza reached him butwhen close to the hares scut paused as if measuring the distance so asnot to make a mistake this time but seize his hind legerza darling ilagin wailed in a voice unlike his own erza did nothearken to his appeal at the very moment when she would have seized herprey the hare moved and darted along the balk between the winter ryeand the stubble again erza and milka were abreast running like a pairof carriage horses and began to overtake the hare but it was easierfor the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not overtake him soquicklyrugay rugayushka thats it come on came a third voice just thenand uncles red borzoi straining and curving its back caught up withthe two foremost borzois pushed ahead of them regardless of theterrible strain put on speed close to the hare knocked it off the balkonto the ryefield again put on speed still more viciously sinking tohis knees in the muddy field and all one could see was how muddyinghis back he rolled over with the hare a ring of borzois surroundedhim a moment later everyone had drawn up round the crowd of dogs onlythe delighted uncle dismounted and cut off a pad shaking the harefor the blood to drip off and anxiously glancing round with restlesseyes while his arms and legs twitched he spoke without himself knowingwhom to or what about thats it come on thats a dog there ithas beaten them all the thousandruble as well as the onerubleborzois thats it come on said he panting and looking wrathfullyaround as if he were abusing someone as if they were all his enemiesand had insulted him and only now had he at last succeeded injustifying himself there are your thousandruble ones thats itcome onrugay heres a pad for you he said throwing down the hares muddypad youve deserved it thats it come onshed tired herself out shed run it down three times by herselfsaid nicholas also not listening to anyone and regardless of whether hewere heard or notbut what is there in running across it like that said ilagins groomonce she had missed it and turned it away any mongrel could take itilagin was saying at the same time breathless from his gallop and hisexcitement at the same moment natasha without drawing breath screamedjoyously ecstatically and so piercingly that it set everyones eartingling by that shriek she expressed what the others expressed by alltalking at once and it was so strange that she must herself have beenashamed of so wild a cry and everyone else would have been amazed at itat any other time uncle himself twisted up the hare threw it neatlyand smartly across his horses back as if by that gesture he meant torebuke everybody and with an air of not wishing to speak to anyonemounted his bay and rode off the others all followed dispirited andshamefaced and only much later were they able to regain their formeraffectation of indifference for a long time they continued to look atred rugay who his arched back spattered with mud and clanking the ringof his leash walked along just behind uncles horse with the sereneair of a conquerorwell i am like any other dog as long as its not a question ofcoursing but when it is then look out his appearance seemed tonicholas to be sayingwhen much later uncle rode up to nicholas and began talking to himhe felt flattered that after what had happened uncle deigned tospeak to himtoward evening ilagin took leave of nicholas who found that they wereso far from home that he accepted uncles offer that the hunting partyshould spend the night in his little village of mikhaylovnaand if you put up at my house that will be better still thats itcome on said uncle you see its damp weather and you could restand the little countess could be driven home in a trapuncles offer was accepted a huntsman was sent to otradnoe for atrap while nicholas rode with natasha and petya to uncles housesome five male domestic serfs big and little rushed out to the frontporch to meet their master a score of women serfs old and young aswell as children popped out from the back entrance to have a look atthe hunters who were arriving the presence of natashaa woman a ladyand on horsebackraised the curiosity of the serfs to such a degreethat many of them came up to her stared her in the face and unabashedby her presence made remarks about her as though she were some prodigyon show and not a human being able to hear or understand what was saidabout herarinka look she sits sideways there she sits and her skirtdangles see shes got a little hunting horngoodness gracious see her knifeisnt she a tartarhow is it you didnt go head over heels asked the boldest of alladdressing natasha directlyuncle dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which stoodin the midst of an overgrown garden and after a glance at hisretainers shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should takethemselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made toreceive the guests and the visitorsthe serfs all dispersed uncle lifted natasha off her horse and takingher hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch the housewith its bare unplastered log walls was not overcleanit did not seemthat those living in it aimed at keeping it spotlessbut neither was itnoticeably neglected in the entry there was a smell of fresh applesand wolf and fox skins hung aboutuncle led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with afolding table and red chairs then into the drawing room with a roundbirchwood table and a sofa and finally into his private room wherethere was a tattered sofa a worn carpet and portraits of suvorov ofthe hosts father and mother and of himself in military uniform thestudy smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs uncle asked his visitors tosit down and make themselves at home and then went out of the roomrugay his back still muddy came into the room and lay down on thesofa cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth leading from the studywas a passage in which a partition with ragged curtains could be seenfrom behind this came womens laughter and whispers natasha nicholasand petya took off their wraps and sat down on the sofa petya leaningon his elbow fell asleep at once natasha and nicholas were silenttheir faces glowed they were hungry and very cheerful they looked atone another now that the hunt was over and they were in the housenicholas no longer considered it necessary to show his manly superiorityover his sister natasha gave him a wink and neither refrained longfrom bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before they had apretext ready to account for itafter a while uncle came in in a cossack coat blue trousers andsmall top boots and natasha felt that this costume the very one shehad regarded with surprise and amusement at otradnoe was just the rightthing and not at all worse than a swallowtail or frock coat uncletoo was in high spirits and far from being offended by the brothers andsisters laughter it could never enter his head that they might belaughing at his way of life he himself joined in the merrimentthats right young countess thats it come on i never saw anyonelike her said he offering nicholas a pipe with a long stem and witha practiced motion of three fingers taking down another that

woman ofabout forty with a double chin and full red lips entered carrying alarge loaded tray with hospitable dignity and cordiality in her glanceand in every motion she looked at the visitors and with a pleasantsmile bowed respectfully in spite of her exceptional stoutness whichcaused her to protrude her chest and stomach and throw back her headthis woman who was uncles housekeeper trod very lightly she wentto the table set down the tray and with her plump white hands deftlytook from it the bottles and various hors doeuvres and dishes andarranged them on the table when she had finished

brandy rostov and uncle talked ofpast and future hunts of rugay and ilagins dogs while natasha satupright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes she tried severaltimes to wake petya that he might eat something but he only mutteredincoherent words without waking up natasha felt so lighthearted andhappy in these novel surroundings that she only feared the trap wouldcome for her too soon

theycalled the room for the hunt servantsthere was a rapid patter of bare feet and an unseen hand opened thedoor into the huntsmens room from which came the clear sounds of abalalayka on which someone who was evidently a master of the art wasplaying natasha had been listening to those strains for some time andnow went out into the passage to hear betterthats mitka my coachman i have got him a good balalayka im fondof it said uncleit was the custom for mitka to play the balalayka in the huntsmens roomwhen uncle returned from the chase uncle was fond of such musichow good really very good said nicholas with some unintentionalsuperciliousness as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased himvery muchvery good said natasha reproachfully noticing her brothers tonenot very good its simply deliciousjust as uncles pickled mushrooms honey and cherry brandy had seemedto her the best in the world so also that song at that moment seemedto her the acme of musical delightmore please more cried natasha at the door as soon as the balalaykaceased mitka tuned up afresh and recommenced thrumming the balalaykato the air of my lady with trills and variations uncle satlistening slightly smiling with his head on one side the air wasrepeated a hundred times the balalayka was retuned several times andthe same notes were thrummed again but the listeners did not grow wearyof it and wished to hear it again and again anisya fedorovna came inand leaned her portly person against the doorpostyou like listening she said to natasha with a smile extremely likeuncles thats a good player of ours she addedhe doesnt play that part right said uncle suddenly with anenergetic gesture here he ought to burst outthats it come onought to burst outdo you play then asked natashauncle did not answer but smiledanisya go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right i haventtouched it for a long time thats itcome on ive given it upanisya fedorovna with her light step willingly went to fulfill hererrand and brought back the guitarwithout looking at anyone uncle blew the dust off it and tapping thecase with his bony fingers tuned the guitar and settled himself in hisarmchair he took the guitar a little above the fingerboard arching hisleft elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture and with a wink atanisya fedorovna struck a single chord pure and sonorous and thenquietly smoothly and confidently began playing in very slow time notmy lady but the wellknown song came a maiden down the street thetune played with precision and in exact time began to thrill in thehearts of nicholas and natasha arousing in them the same kind of sobermirth as radiated from anisya fedorovnas whole being anisya fedorovnaflushed and drawing her kerchief over her face went laughing out of theroom uncle continued to play correctly carefully with energeticfirmness looking with a changed and inspired expression at the spotwhere anisya fedorovna had just stood something seemed to be laughing alittle on one side of his face under his gray mustaches especially asthe song grew brisker and the time quicker and when here and there ashe ran his fingers over the strings something seemed to snaplovely lovely go on uncle go on shouted natasha as soon as he hadfinished she jumped up and hugged and kissed him nicholas nicholasshe said turning to her brother as if asking him what is it moves mesonicholas too was greatly pleased by uncles playing and uncleplayed the piece over again anisya fedorovnas smiling face reappearedin the doorway and behind hers other facesfetching water clear and sweet stop dear maiden i entreatplayed uncle once more running his fingers skillfully over thestrings and then he stopped short and jerked his shouldersgo on uncle dear natasha wailed in an imploring tone as if her lifedepended on ituncle rose and it was as if there were two men in him one of themsmiled seriously at the merry fellow while the merry fellow struck anaive and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dancenow then niece he exclaimed waving to natasha the hand that hadjust struck a chordnatasha threw off the shawl from her shoulders ran forward to faceuncle and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with hershoulders and struck an attitudewhere how and when had this young countess educated by an emigreefrench governess imbibed from the russian air she breathed that spiritand obtained that manner which the pas de chale  would one would havesupposed long ago have effaced but the spirit and the movements werethose inimitable and unteachable russian ones that uncle had expectedof her as soon as she had struck her pose and smiled triumphantlyproudly and with sly merriment the fear that had at first seizednicholas and the others that she might not do the right thing was at anend and they were already admiring her the french shawl danceshe did the right thing with such precision such complete precisionthat anisya fedorovna who had at once handed her the handkerchief sheneeded for the dance had tears in her eyes though she laughed as shewatched this slim graceful countess reared in silks and velvets and sodifferent from herself who yet was able to understand all that was inanisya and in anisyas father and mother and aunt and in every russianman and womanwell little countess thats itcome on cried uncle with ajoyous laugh having finished the dance well done niece now a fineyoung fellow must be found as husband for you thats itcome onhes chosen already said nicholas smilingoh said uncle in surprise looking inquiringly at natasha whonodded her head with a happy smileand such a one she said but as soon as she had said it a new trainof thoughts and feelings arose in her what did nicholas smile meanwhen he said chosen already is he glad of it or not it is as if hethought my bolkonski would not approve of or understand our gaiety buthe would understand it all where is he now she thought and her facesuddenly became serious but this lasted only a second dont dare tothink about it she said to herself and sat down again smilinglybeside uncle begging him to play something moreuncle played another song and a valse then after a pause he clearedhis throat and sang his favorite hunting songas twas growing dark last night fell the snow so soft and lightuncle sang as peasants sing with full and naive conviction that thewhole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes ofitself and that apart from the words there is no tune which existsonly to give measure to the words as a result of this the unconsideredtune like the song of a bird was extraordinarily good natasha was inecstasies over uncles singing she resolved to give up learning theharp and to play only the guitar she asked uncle for his guitar andat once found the chords of the songafter nine oclock two traps and three mounted men who had been sent tolook for them arrived to fetch natasha and petya the count andcountess did not know where they were and were very anxious said one ofthe menpetya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the twotraps natasha and nicholas got into the other uncle wrapped natashaup warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness heaccompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be crossedso that they had to go round by the ford and he sent huntsmen to ridein front with lanternsgoodbye dear niece his voice called out of the darknessnot thevoice natasha had known previously but the one that had sung as twasgrowing dark last nightin the village through which they passed there were red lights and acheerful smell of smokewhat a darling uncle is said natasha when they had come out onto thehighroadyes returned nicholas youre not coldno im quite quite all right i feel so comfortable answerednatasha almost perplexed by her feelings they remained silent a longwhile the night was dark and damp they could not see the horses butonly heard them splashing through the unseen mudwhat was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caughtand assimilated all the diverse impressions of life how did they allfind place in her but she was very happy as they were nearing home shesuddenly struck up the air of as twas growing dark last nightthe tuneof which she had all the way been trying to get and had at last caughtgot it said nicholaswhat were you thinking about just now nicholas inquired natashathey were fond of asking one another that questioni said nicholas trying to remember well you see first i thoughtthat rugay the red hound was like uncle and that if he were a man hewould always keep uncle near him if not for his riding then for hismanner what a good fellow uncle is dont you think so well andyoui wait a bit wait yes first i thought that we are driving alongand imagining that we are going home but that heaven knows where we arereally going in the darkness and that we shall arrive and suddenly findthat we are not in otradnoe but in fairyland and then i thought nonothing elsei know i expect you thought of him said nicholas smiling as natashaknew by the sound of his voiceno said natasha though she had in reality been thinking about princeandrew at the same time as of the rest and of how he would have likeduncle and then i was saying to myself all the way how well anisyacarried herself how well and nicholas heard her spontaneous happyringing laughter and do you know she suddenly said i know that ishall never again be as happy and tranquil as i am nowrubbish nonsense humbug exclaimed nicholas and he thought howcharming this natasha of mine is i have no other friend like her andnever shall have why should she marry we might always drive abouttogetherwhat a darling this nicholas of mine is thought natashaah there are still lights in the drawingroom she said pointing tothe windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the moist velvetydarkness of the nightcount ilya rostov had resigned the position of marshal of the nobilitybecause it involved him in too much expense but still his affairs didnot improve natasha and nicholas often noticed their parents conferringtogether anxiously and privately and heard suggestions of selling thefine ancestral rostov house and estate near moscow it was not necessaryto entertain so freely as when the count had been marshal and life atotradnoe was quieter than in former years but still the enormous houseand its lodges were full of people and more than twenty sat down totable every day these were all their own people who had settled down inthe house almost as members of the family or persons who were itseemed obliged to live in the counts house such were dimmler themusician and his wife vogel the dancing master and his family belovaan old maiden lady an inmate of the house and many others such aspetyas tutors the girls former governess and other people who simplyfound it preferable and more advantageous to live in the counts housethan at home they had not as many visitors as before but the oldhabits of life without which the count and countess could not conceiveof existence remained unchanged there was still the huntingestablishment which nicholas had even enlarged the same fifty horsesand fifteen grooms in the stables the same expensive presents anddinner parties to the whole district on name days there were still thecounts games of whist and boston at whichspreading out his cards sothat everybody could see themhe let himself be plundered of hundredsof rubles every day by his neighbors who looked upon an opportunity toplay a rubber with count rostov as a most profitable source of incomethe count moved in his affairs as in a huge net trying not to believethat he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every step andfeeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work carefully andpatiently to disentangle them the countess with her loving heart feltthat her children were being ruined that it was not the counts faultfor he could not help being what he wasthat though he tried to hideit he himself suffered from the consciousness of his own and hischildrens ruin and she tried to find means of remedying the positionfrom her feminine point of view she could see only one solution namelyfor nicholas to marry a rich heiress she felt this to be their lasthope and that if nicholas refused the match she had found for him shewould have to abandon the hope of ever getting matters right this matchwas with julie karagina the daughter of excellent and virtuous parentsa girl the rostovs had known from childhood and who had now become awealthy heiress through the death of the last of her brothersthe countess had written direct to julies mother in moscow suggesting amarriage between their children and had received a favorable answer fromher karagina had replied that for her part she was agreeable andeverything depend on her daughters inclination she invited nicholas tocome to moscowseveral times the countess with tears in her eyes told her son thatnow both her daughters were settled her only wish was to see himmarried she said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if thatwere accomplished then she told him that she knew of a splendid girland tried to discover what he thought about marriageat other times she praised julie to him and advised him to go to moscowduring the holidays to amuse himself nicholas guessed what his mothersremarks were leading to and during one of these conversations inducedher to speak quite frankly she told him that her only hope of gettingtheir affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying julie karaginabut mamma suppose i loved a girl who has no fortune would you expectme to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of money heasked his mother not realizing the cruelty of his question and onlywishing to show his noblemindednessno you have not understood me said his mother not knowing how tojustify herself you have not understood me nikolenka it is yourhappiness i wish for she added feeling that she was telling anuntruth and was becoming entangled she began to crymamma dont cry only tell me that you wish it and you know i willgive my life anything to put you at ease said nicholas i wouldsacrifice anything for youeven my feelingsbut the countess did not want the question put like that she did notwant a sacrifice from her son she herself wished to make a sacrificefor himno you have not understood me dont let us talk about it shereplied wiping away her tearsmaybe i do love a poor girl said nicholas to himself am i tosacrifice my feelings and my honor for money i wonder how mamma couldspeak so to me because sonya is poor i must not love her he thoughtmust not respond to her faithful devoted love yet i should certainlybe happier with her than with some dolllike julie i can alwayssacrifice my feelings for my familys welfare he said to himself buti cant coerce my feelings if i love sonya that feeling is for mestronger and higher than all elsenicholas did not go to moscow and the countess did not renew theconversation with him about marriage she saw with sorrow and sometimeswith exasperation symptoms of a growing attachment between her son andthe portionless sonya though she blamed herself for it she could notrefrain from grumbling at and worrying sonya often pulling her upwithout reason addressing her stiffly as my dear and using theformal you instead of the intimate thou in speaking to her thekindhearted countess was the more vexed with sonya because that poordarkeyed niece of hers was so meek so kind so devotedly grateful toher benefactors and so faithfully unchangingly and unselfishly inlove with nicholas that there were no grounds for finding fault withhernicholas was spending the last of his leave at home a fourth letter hadcome from prince andrew from rome in which he wrote that he would havebeen on his way back to russia long ago had not his wound unexpectedlyreopened in the warm climate which obliged him to defer his return tillthe beginning of the new year natasha was still as much in love withher betrothed found the same comfort in that love and was still asready to throw herself into all the pleasures of life as before but atthe end of the fourth month of their separation she began to have fitsof depression which she could not master she felt sorry for herselfsorry that she was being wasted all this time and of no use to anyonewhile she felt herself so capable of loving and being lovedthings were not cheerful in the rostovs homechristmas came and except for the ceremonial mass the solemn andwearisome christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants and thenew dresses everyone put on there were no special festivities thoughthe calm frost of twenty

with two oldladies natasha came into the room went up to sonya glanced at whatshe was doing and then went up to her mother and stood withoutspeakingwhy are you wandering about like an outcast asked her mother whatdo you wanthim i want him now this minute i want him said natasha withglittering eyes and no sign of a smilethe countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughterdont look

quickly tohide them and left the roomshe passed into the sitting room stood there thinking awhile and thenwent into the maids room there an old maidservant was grumbling at ayoung girl who stood

one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble asnatasha did she could not see people unconcernedly but had to sendthem on some errand she seemed to be trying whether any of them wouldget angry or sulky with her but the serfs fulfilled no ones orders soreadily as they did hers what can i do where can i go thought sheas she went slowly along the passagenastasya ivanovna what sort of children shall i have she asked thebuffoon who was coming toward her in a womans jacketwhy fleas crickets grasshoppers answered the buffoono lord o lord its always the same oh where am i to go what am ito do with myself and tapping with her heels she ran quickly upstairsto see vogel and his wife who lived on the upper storytwo governesses were sitting with the vogels at a table on which wereplates of raisins walnuts and almonds the governesses were discussingwhether it was cheaper to live in moscow or odessa natasha sat downlistened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air and then gotup againthe island of madagascar she said madagascar she repeatedarticulating each syllable distinctly and not replying to madameschoss who asked her what she was saying she went out of the roomher brother petya was upstairs too with the man in attendance on him hewas preparing fireworks to let off that nightpetya petya she called to him carry me downstairspetya ran up and offered her his back she jumped on it putting herarms round his neck and he pranced along with herno dont the island of madagascar she said and jumping off hisback she went downstairshaving as it were reviewed her kingdom tested her power and made surethat everyone was submissive but that all the same it was dull natashabetook herself to the ballroom picked up her guitar sat down in a darkcorner behind a bookcase and began to run her fingers over the stringsin the bass picking out a passage she recalled from an opera she hadheard in petersburg with prince andrew what she drew from the guitarwould have had no meaning for other listeners but in her imagination awhole series of reminiscences arose from those sounds she sat behindthe bookcase with her eyes fixed on a streak of light escaping from thepantry door and listened to herself and pondered she was in a mood forbrooding on the pastsonya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand natasha glanced ather and at the crack in the pantry door and it seemed to her that sheremembered the light falling through that crack once before and sonyapassing with a glass in her hand yes it was exactly the same thoughtnatashasonya what is this she cried twanging a thick stringoh you are there said sonya with a start and came near andlistened i dont know a storm she ventured timidly afraid of beingwrongthere thats just how she started and just how she came up smilingtimidly when all this happened before thought natasha and in justthe same way i thought there was something lacking in herno its the chorus from the watercarrier listen and natasha sangthe air of the chorus so that sonya should catch it where were yougoing she askedto change the water in this glass i am just finishing the designyou always find something to do but i cant said natasha andwheres nicholasasleep i thinksonya go and wake him said natasha tell him i want him to come andsingshe sat awhile wondering what the meaning of it all having happenedbefore could be and without solving this problem or at all regrettingnot having done so she again passed in fancy to the time when she waswith him and he was looking at her with a lovers eyesoh if only he would come quicker i am so afraid it will never beand worst of all i am growing oldthats the thing there wont thenbe in me what there is now but perhaps hell come today will comeimmediately perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing roomperhaps he came yesterday and i have forgotten it she rose put downthe guitar and went to the drawing roomall the domestic circle tutors governesses and guests were alreadyat the tea table the servants stood round the tablebut prince andrewwas not there and life was going on as beforeah here she is said the old count when he saw natasha enter wellsit down by me but natasha stayed by her mother and glanced round asif looking for somethingmamma she muttered give him to me give him mamma quicklyquickly and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobsshe sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between theelders and nicholas who had also come to the table my god my godthe same faces the same talk papa holding his cup and blowing in thesame way thought natasha feeling with horror a sense of repulsionrising up in her for the whole household because they were always thesameafter tea nicholas sonya and natasha went to the sitting room totheir favorite corner where their most intimate talks always begandoes it ever happen to you said natasha to her brother when theysettled down in the sitting room does it ever happen to you to feel asif there were nothing more to comenothing that everything good ispast and to feel not exactly dull but sadi should think so he replied i have felt like that when everythingwas all right and everyone was cheerful the thought has come into mymind that i was already tired of it all and that we must all die oncein the regiment i had not gone to some merrymaking where there wasmusic and suddenly i felt so depressedoh yes i know i know i know natasha interrupted him when i wasquite little that used to be so with me do you remember when i waspunished once about some plums you were all dancing and i sat sobbingin the schoolroom i shall never forget it i felt sad and sorry foreveryone for myself and for everyone and i was innocentthat was thechief thing said natasha do you rememberi remember answered nicholas i remember that i came to youafterwards and wanted to comfort you but do you know i felt ashamedto we were terribly absurd i had a funny doll then and wanted to giveit to you do you rememberand do you remember natasha asked with a pensive smile how oncelong long ago when we were quite little uncle called us into thestudythat was in the old houseand it was darkwe went in andsuddenly there stooda negro chimed in nicholas with a smile of delight of course iremember even now i dont know whether there really was a negro or ifwe only dreamed it or were told about himhe was gray you remember and had white teeth and stood and looked atussonya do you remember asked nicholasyes yes i do remember something too sonya answered timidlyyou know i have asked papa and mamma about that negro said natashaand they say there was no negro at all but you see you rememberof course i do i remember his teeth as if i had just seen themhow strange it is its as if it were a dream i like thatand do you remember how we rolled hardboiled eggs in the ballroom andsuddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet was that realor not do you remember what fun it wasyes and you remember how papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in theporchso they went through their memories smiling with pleasure not the sadmemories of old age but poetic youthful onesthose impressions ofones most distant past in which dreams and realities blendand theylaughed with quiet enjoymentsonya as always did not quite keep pace with them though they sharedthe same reminiscencesmuch that they remembered had slipped from her mind and what sherecalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced shesimply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with itshe only really took part when they recalled sonyas first arrival shetold them how afraid she had been of nicholas because he had on a cordedjacket and her nurse had told her that she too would be sewn up withcordsand i remember their telling me that you had been born under acabbage said natasha and i remember that i dared not disbelieve itthen but knew that it was not true and i felt so uncomfortablewhile they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other door ofthe sitting roomthey have brought the cock miss she said in a whisperit isnt wanted petya tell them to take it away replied natashain the middle of their talk in the sitting room dimmler came in andwent up to the harp that stood there in a corner he took off its clothcovering and the harp gave out a jarring soundmr dimmler please play my favorite nocturne by field came the oldcountess voice from the drawing roomdimmler struck a chord and turning to natasha nicholas and sonyaremarked how quiet you young people areyes were philosophizing said natasha glancing round for a momentand then continuing the conversation they were now discussing dreamsdimmler began to play natasha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the tabletook up a candle carried it out and returned seating herself quietlyin her former place it was dark in the room especially where they weresitting on the sofa but through the big windows the silvery light ofthe full moon fell on the floor dimmler had finished the piece butstill sat softly running his fingers over the strings evidentlyuncertain whether to stop or to play something elsedo you know said natasha in a whisper moving closer to nicholas andsonya that when one goes on and on recalling memories one at lastbegins to remember what happened before one was in the worldthat is metempsychosis said sonya who had always learned well andremembered everything the egyptians believed that our souls have livedin animals and will go back into animals againno i dont believe we ever were in animals said natasha still in awhisper though the music had ceased but i am certain that we wereangels somewhere there and have been here and that is why weremembermay i join you said dimmler who had come up quietly and he sat downby themif we have been angels why have we fallen lower said nicholas nothat cant benot lower who said we were lower how do i know what i was beforenatasha rejoined with conviction the soul is immortalwell then if ishall always live i must have lived before lived for a whole eternityyes but it is hard for us to imagine eternity remarked dimmler whohad joined the young folk with a mildly condescending smile but nowspoke as quietly and seriously as theywhy is it hard to imagine eternity said natasha it is now todayand it will be tomorrow and always and there was yesterday and theday beforenatasha now its your turn sing me something they heard thecountess say why are you sitting there like conspiratorsmamma i dont at all want to replied natasha but all the same sherosenone of them not even the middleaged dimmler wanted to break offtheir conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room but natashagot up and nicholas sat down at the clavichord standing as usual in themiddle of the hall and choosing the place where the resonance was bestnatasha began to sing her mothers favorite songshe had said she did not want to sing but it was long since she hadsung and long before she again sang as she did that evening thecount from his study where he was talking to mitenka heard her andlike a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play blundered in his talkwhile giving orders to the steward and at last stopped while mitenkastood in front of him also listening and smiling nicholas did not takehis eyes off his sister and drew breath in time with her sonya as shelistened thought of the immense difference there was between herselfand her friend and how impossible it was for her to be anything like asbewitching as her cousin the old countess sat with a blissful yet sadsmile and with tears in her eyes occasionally shaking her head shethought of natasha and of her own youth and of how there was somethingunnatural and dreadful in this impending marriage of natasha and princeandrewdimmler who had seated himself beside the countess listened withclosed eyesah countess he said at last thats a european talent she hasnothing to learnwhat softness tenderness and strengthah how afraid i am for her how afraid i am said the countess notrealizing to whom she was speaking her maternal instinct told her thatnatasha had too much of something and that because of this she wouldnot be happy before natasha had finished singing fourteenyearoldpetya rushed in delightedly to say that some mummers had arrivednatasha stopped abruptlyidiot she screamed at her brother and running to a chair threwherself on it sobbing so violently that she could not stop for a longtimeits nothing mamma really its nothing only petya startled me shesaid trying to smile but her tears still flowed and sobs still chokedherthe mummers some of the house serfs dressed up as bears turksinnkeepers and ladiesfrightening and funnybringing in with them thecold from outside and a feeling of gaiety crowded at first timidlyinto the anteroom then hiding behind one another they pushed into theballroom where shyly at first and then more and more merrily andheartily they started singing dancing and playing christmas gamesthe countess when she had identified them and laughed at theircostumes went into the drawing room the count sat in the ballroomsmiling radiantly and applauding the players the young people haddisappearedhalf an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in theballroom an old lady in a hooped skirtthis was nicholas a turkishgirl was petya a clown was dimmler an hussar was natasha and acircassian was sonya with burntcork mustache and eyebrowsafter the condescending surprise nonrecognition and praise from thosewho were not themselves dressed up the young people decided that theircostumes were so good that they ought to be shown elsewherenicholas who as the roads were in splendid condition wanted to takethem all for a drive in his troyka proposed to take with them about adozen of the serf mummers and drive to unclesno why disturb the old fellow said the countess besides youwouldnt have room to turn round there if you must go go

upnicholas set off following the first sleigh behind him the othersmoved noisily their runners squeaking at first they drove at a steadytrot along the narrow road while they drove past the garden the shadowsof the bare trees often fell across the road and hid the brilliantmoonlight but as soon as they were past the fence the snowy plainbathed in moonlight and motionless spread out before them glitteringlike diamonds and dappled with bluish shadows bang bang went thefirst sleigh over a cradle hole in the snow of the road and each of theother sleighs jolted in the same way and rudely breaking the frostbound stillness the troykas began to speed along the road one afterthe othera hares track a lot of tracks rang out natashas voice through thefrostbound airhow light it is nicholas

distantin the moonlightthat used to be sonya thought he and looked at her closer andsmiledwhat is it nicholasnothing said he and turned again to the horseswhen they came out onto the beaten highroadpolished by sleigh runnersand cut up by roughshod hoofs the marks of which were visible in themoonlightthe horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord andincreased their pace the near side horse arching his head and breakinginto a short canter tugged at his traces the shaft horse swayed fromside to side moving his ears as if asking isnt it time to beginnow in front already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringingfarther and farther off the black horses driven by zakhar could beclearly seen against the white snow from that sleigh one could hear theshouts laughter and voices of the mummersgee up my darlings shouted nicholas pulling the reins to one sideand flourishing the whipit was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by theside horses who pulled harderever increasing their gallopthat onenoticed how fast the troyka was flying nicholas looked back withscreams squeals and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horsesto gallopthe other sleighs followed the shaft horse swung steadilybeneath the bow over its head with no thought of slackening pace andready to put on speed when requirednicholas overtook the first sleigh they were driving downhill andcoming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow near a riverwhere are we thought he its the kosoy meadow i suppose but nothis is something new ive never seen before this isnt

sleighbesidethem sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses ofswiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing thewhistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girlsshrieking were heard from different sidesagain checking his horses nicholas looked around him they were stillsurrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled withstarszakhar is shouting that i should turn to the left but why to theleft thought nicholas are we getting to the melyukovs is thismelyukovka heaven only knows where we are going and heaven knows

ring and string game or the ruble game ortalking as now nicholas did not leave sonyas side and gazed at herwith quite new eyes it seemed to him that it was only today thanks tothat burntcork mustache that he had fully learned to know her andreally that evening sonya was brighter more animated and prettierthan nicholas had ever seen her beforeso thats what she is like what a fool i have been he thought gazingat her sparkling eyes and under the mustache a happy rapturous smiledimpled her cheeks a smile he had never seen beforeim not afraid of anything said sonya may i go at once she gotupthey told her where the barn was and how she should stand and listenand they handed her a fur cloak she threw this over her head andshoulders and glanced at nicholaswhat a darling that girl is thought he and what have i beenthinking of till nowsonya went out into the passage to go to the barn nicholas went hastilyto the front porch saying he felt too hot the crowd of people reallyhad made the house stuffyoutside there was the same cold stillness and the same moon but evenbrighter than before the light was so strong and the snow sparkled withso many stars that one did not wish to look up at the sky and the realstars were unnoticed the sky was black and dreary while the earth wasgayi am a fool a fool what have i been waiting for thought nicholasand running out from the porch he went round the corner of the house andalong the path that led to the back porch he knew sonya would pass thatway halfway lay some snowcovered piles of firewood and across andalong them a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees fell on thesnow and on the path this path led to the barn the log walls of thebarn and its snowcovered roof that looked as if hewn out of someprecious stone sparkled in the moonlight a tree in the garden snappedwith the frost and then all was again perfectly silent his bosomseemed to inhale not air but the strength of eternal youth and gladnessfrom the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps thebottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heardthe voice of an old maidservant saying straight straight along thepath miss only dont look backi am not afraid answered sonyas voice and along the path towardnicholas came the crunching whistling sound of sonyas feet in her thinshoessonya came along wrapped in her cloak she was only a couple of pacesaway when she saw him and to her too he was not the nicholas she hadknown and always slightly feared he was in a womans dress withtousled hair and a happy smile new to sonya she ran rapidly toward himquite different and yet the same thought nicholas looking at herface all lit up by the moonlight he slipped his arms under the cloakthat covered her head embraced her pressed her to him and kissed heron the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt cork sonyakissed him full on the lips and disengaging her little hands pressedthem to his cheekssonya nicholas was all they said they ran to the barn andthen back again reentering he by the front and she by the back porchwhen they all drove back from pelageya danilovnas natasha who alwayssaw and noticed everything arranged that she and madame schoss shouldgo back in the sleigh with dimmler and sonya with nicholas and themaidson the way back nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing andkept peering by that fantastic alltransforming light into sonyas faceand searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former and hispresent sonya from whom he had resolved never to be parted again helooked and recognizing in her both the old and the new sonya and beingreminded by the smell of burnt cork of the sensation of her kissinhaled the frosty air with a full breast and looking at the groundflying beneath him and at the sparkling sky felt himself again infairylandsonya is it well with thee he asked from time to timeyes she replied and with theewhen halfway home nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and ran fora moment to natashas sleigh and stood on its wingnatasha he whispered in french do you know i have made up my mindabout sonyahave you told her asked natasha suddenly beaming all over with joyoh how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrowsnatashaare you gladi am so glad so glad i was beginning to be vexed with you i did nottell you but you have been treating her badly what a heart she hasnicholas i am horrid sometimes but i was ashamed to be happy whilesonya was not continued natasha now i am so glad well run back toherno wait a bit oh how funny you look cried nicholas peeringinto her face and finding in his sister too something new unusual andbewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before natasha itsmagical isnt ityes she replied you have done splendidlyhad i seen her before as she is now thought nicholas i should longago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me andall would have been wellso you are glad and i have done rightoh quite right i had a quarrel with mamma some time ago about itmamma said she was angling for you how could she say such a thing inearly stormed at mamma i will never let anyone say anything bad ofsonya for there is nothing but good in herthen its all right said nicholas again scrutinizing the expressionof his sisters face to see if she was in earnest then he jumped downand his boots scrunching the snow ran back to his sleigh the samehappy smiling circassian with mustache and beaming eyes looking upfrom under a sable hood was still sitting there and that circassianwas sonya and that sonya was certainly his future happy and lovingwifewhen they reached home and had told their mother how they had spent theevening at the melyukovs the girls went to their bedroom when theyhad undressed but without washing off the cork mustaches they sat along time talking of their happiness they talked of how they would livewhen they were married how their husbands would be friends and howhappy they would be on natashas table stood two looking glasses whichdunyasha had prepared beforehandonly when will all that be i am afraid never it would be toogood said natasha rising and going

seeing her own faceyou mustnt laugh miss said dunyashawith sonyas help and the maids natasha got the glass she held intothe right position opposite the other her face assumed a seriousexpression and she sat silent she sat a long time looking at thereceding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting fromtales she had heard to see a coffin or him prince andrew in thatlast dim indistinctly outlined square but ready as she was to take thesmallest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin she saw nothingshe began blinking rapidly and moved away from the looking glasseswhy is it others see things and i dont she said you sit down nowsonya you absolutely must tonight do it for me today i feel sofrightenedsonya sat down before the glasses got the right position and

her frightened eyes fixed onher friendno on the contrary on the contrary his face was cheerful and heturned to me and when saying this she herself fancied she had reallyseen what she describedwell and then sonyaafter that i could not make out what there was something blue andredsonya when will he come back when shall i see him o god how afraidi am for him and for myself and about everything natasha began andwithout replying to sonyas words of comfort she got into bed and longafter her candle was out lay openeyed and motionless gazing at themoonlight through the frosty windowpanessoon after the christmas holidays nicholas told his mother of his lovefor sonya and of his firm resolve to marry her the countess who hadlong noticed what was going on between them and was expecting thisdeclaration listened to him in silence and then told her son that hemight marry whom he pleased but that neither she nor his father wouldgive their blessing to such a marriage nicholas for the first timefelt that his mother was displeased with him and that despite her lovefor him she would not give way coldly without looking at her son shesent for her husband and when he came tried briefly and coldly toinform him of the facts in her sons presence but unable to restrainherself she burst into tears of vexation and left the room the oldcount began irresolutely to admonish nicholas and beg him to abandon hispurpose nicholas replied that he could not go back on his word and hisfather sighing and evidently disconcerted very soon became silent andwent in to the countess in all his encounters with his son the countwas always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted thefamily fortune and so he could not be angry with him for refusing tomarry an heiress and choosing the dowerless sonya on this occasion hewas only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had notbeen in disorder no better wife for nicholas than sonya could have beenwished for and that no one but himself with his mitenka and hisuncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the familyfinancesthe father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son againbut a few days later the countess sent for sonya and with a crueltyneither of them expected reproached her niece for trying to catchnicholas and for ingratitude sonya listened silently with downcast eyesto the countess cruel words without understanding what was required ofher she was ready to sacrifice everything for her benefactors selfsacrifice was her most cherished idea but in this case she could not seewhat she ought to sacrifice or for whom she could not help loving thecountess and the whole rostov family but neither could she help lovingnicholas and knowing that his happiness depended on that love she wassilent and sad and did not reply nicholas felt the situation to beintolerable and went to have an explanation with his mother he firstimplored her to forgive him and sonya and consent to their marriagethen he threatened that if she molested sonya he would at once marry hersecretlythe countess with a coldness her son had never seen in her beforereplied that he was of age that prince andrew was marrying without hisfathers consent and he could do the same but that she would neverreceive that intriguer as her daughterexploding at the word intriguer nicholas raising his voice told hismother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell hisfeelings but if that were so he would say for the last time but hehad no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of his facecaused his mother to await with terror and which would perhaps haveforever remained a cruel memory to them both he had not time to say itfor natasha with a pale and set face entered the room from the door atwhich she had been listeningnicholas you are talking nonsense be quiet be quiet be quiet itell you she almost screamed so as to drown his voicemamma darling its not at all so my poor sweet darling she saidto her mother who conscious that they had been on the brink of arupture gazed at her son with terror but in the obstinacy andexcitement of the conflict could not and would not give waynicholas ill explain to you go away listen mamma darling saidnatashaher words were incoherent but they attained the purpose at which shewas aimingthe countess sobbing heavily hid her face on her daughters breastwhile nicholas rose clutching his head and left the roomnatasha set to work to effect a reconciliation and so far succeededthat nicholas received a promise from his mother that sonya should notbe troubled while he on his side promised not to undertake anythingwithout his parents knowledgefirmly resolved after putting his affairs in order in the regiment toretire from the army and return and marry sonya nicholas serioussorrowful and at variance with his parents but as it seemed to himpassionately in love left at the beginning of january to rejoin hisregimentafter nicholas had gone things in the rostov household were moredepressing than ever and the countess fell ill from mental agitationsonya was unhappy at the separation from nicholas and still more so onaccount of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting towardher the count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of hisaffairs which called for some decisive action their town house andestate near moscow had inevitably to be sold and for this they had togo to moscow but the countess health obliged them to delay theirdeparture from day to daynatasha who had borne the first period of separation from her betrothedlightly and even cheerfully now grew more agitated and impatient everyday the thought that her best days which she would have employed inloving him were being vainly wasted with no advantage to anyonetormented her incessantly his letters for the most part irritated herit hurt her to think that while she lived only in the thought of him hewas living a real life seeing new places and new people that interestedhim the more interesting his letters were the more vexed she felt herletters to him far from giving her any comfort seemed to her awearisome and artificial obligation she could not write because shecould not conceive the possibility of expressing sincerely in a lettereven a thousandth part of what she expressed by voice smile andglance she wrote to him formal monotonous and dry letters to whichshe attached no importance herself and in the rough copies of which thecountess corrected her mistakes in spellingthere was still no improvement in the countess health but it wasimpossible to defer the journey to moscow any longer natashastrousseau had to be ordered and the house sold moreover prince andrewwas expected in moscow where old prince bolkonski was spending thewinter and natasha felt sure he had already arrivedso the countess remained in the country and the count taking sonya andnatasha with him went to moscow at the end of januaryafter prince andrews engagement to natasha pierre without any apparentcause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before firmlyconvinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his benefactor andhappy as he had been in perfecting his inner man to which he haddevoted himself with such ardorall the zest of such a life vanishedafter the engagement of andrew and natasha and the death of josephalexeevich the news of which reached him almost at the same time onlythe skeleton of life remained his house a brilliant wife who nowenjoyed the favors of a very important personage acquaintance with allpetersburg and his court service with its dull formalities and thislife suddenly seemed to pierre unexpectedly loathsome he ceased keepinga diary avoided the company of the brothers began going to the clubagain drank a great deal and came once more in touch with the bachelorsets leading such a life that the countess helene thought it necessaryto speak severely to him about it pierre felt that she was right andto avoid compromising her went away to moscowin moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded andfading princesses still lived with its enormous retinue as soon asdriving through the town he saw the iberian shrine with innumerabletapers burning before the golden covers of the icons the kremlin squarewith its snow undisturbed by vehicles the sleigh drivers and hovels ofthe sivtsev vrazhok those old moscovites who desired nothing hurriednowhere and were ending their days leisurely when he saw those oldmoscow ladies the moscow balls and the english club he felt himselfat home in a quiet haven in moscow he felt at peace at home warm anddirty as in an old dressing gownmoscow society from the old women down to the children received pierrelike a longexpected guest whose place was always ready awaiting himfor moscow society pierre was the nicest kindest most intellectualmerriest and most magnanimous of cranks a heedless genial nobleman ofthe old russian type his purse was always empty because it was open toeveryonebenefit performances poor pictures statues benevolent societiesgypsy choirs schools subscription dinners sprees freemasonschurches and booksno one and nothing met with a refusal from him andhad it not been for two friends who had borrowed large sums from him andtaken him under their protection he would have given everything awaythere was never a dinner or soiree at the club without him as soon ashe sank into his place on the sofa after two bottles of margaux he wassurrounded and talking disputing and joking began when there werequarrels his kindly smile and welltimed jests reconciled theantagonists the masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was nottherewhen after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smileyielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewherewith them shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men atballs he danced if a partner was needed young ladies married andunmarried liked him because without making love to any of them he wasequally amiable to all especially after supper il est charmant ilna pas de sexe  they said of him he is charming he has no sexpierre was one of those retired gentlemeninwaiting of whom there werehundreds goodhumoredly ending their days in moscowhow horrified he would have been seven years before when he firstarrived from abroad had he been told that there was no need for him toseek or plan anything that his rut had long been shaped eternallypredetermined and that wriggle as he might he would be what all in hisposition were he could not have believed it had he not at one timelonged with all his heart to establish a republic in russia thenhimself to be a napoleon then to be a philosopher and then astrategist and the conqueror of napoleon had he not seen thepossibility of and passionately desired the regeneration of the sinfulhuman race and his own progress to the highest degree of perfectionhad he not established schools and hospitals and liberated his serfsbut instead of all thathere he was the wealthy husband of anunfaithful wife a retired gentlemaninwaiting fond of eating anddrinking and as he unbuttoned his waistcoat of abusing the governmenta bit a member of the moscow english club and a universal favorite inmoscow society for a long time he could not reconcile himself to theidea that he was one of those same retired moscow gentlemeninwaitinghe had so despised seven years beforesometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only livingthis life temporarily but then he was shocked by the thought of howmany like himself had entered that life and that club temporarilywith all their teeth and hair and had only left it when not a singletooth or hair remainedin moments of pride when he thought of his position it seemed to himthat he was quite different and distinct from those other retiredgentlemeninwaiting he had formerly despised they were empty stupidcontented fellows satisfied with their position while i am stilldiscontented and want to do something for mankind but perhaps all thesecomrades of mine struggled just like me and sought something new a pathin life of their own and like me were brought by force ofcircumstances society and raceby that elemental force against whichman is powerlessto the condition i am in said he to himself inmoments of humility and after living some time in moscow he no longerdespised but began to grow fond of to respect and to pity hiscomrades in destiny as he pitied himselfpierre no longer suffered moments of despair hypochondria and disgustwith life but the malady that had formerly found expression in suchacute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment whatfor why what is going on in the world he would ask himself inperplexity several times a day involuntarily beginning to reflect anewon the meaning of the phenomena of life but knowing by experience thatthere were no answers to these questions he made haste to turn away fromthem and took up a book or hurried off to the club or to apollonnikolaevichs to exchange the gossip of the townhelene who has never cared for anything but her own body and is one ofthe stupidest women in the world thought pierre is regarded bypeople as the acme of intelligence and refinement and they pay homageto her napoleon bonaparte was despised by all as long as he was greatbut now that he has become a wretched comedian the emperor francis wantsto offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage the spaniards throughthe catholic clergy offer praise to god for their victory over thefrench on the fourteenth of june and the french also through thecatholic clergy offer praise because on that same fourteenth of junethey defeated the spaniards my brother masons swear by the blood thatthey are ready to sacrifice everything for their neighbor but they donot give a ruble each to the collections for the poor and theyintrigue the astraea lodge against the manna seekers and fuss about anauthentic scotch carpet and a charter that nobody needs and the meaningof which the very man who wrote it does not understand we all professthe christian law of forgiveness of injuries and love of our neighborsthe law in honor of which we have built in moscow forty times fortychurchesbut yesterday a deserter was knouted to death and a ministerof that same law of love and forgiveness a priest gave the soldier across to kiss before his execution so thought pierre and the whole ofthis general deception which everyone accepts accustomed as he was toit astonished him each time as if it were something new i understandthe deception and confusion he thought but how am i to tell them allthat i see i have tried and have always found that they too in thedepths of their souls understand it as i do and only try not to see itso it appears that it must be so but iwhat is to become of methought he he had the unfortunate capacity many men especiallyrussians have of seeing and believing in the possibility of goodnessand truth but of seeing the evil and falsehood of life too clearly tobe able to take a serious part in it every sphere of work wasconnected in his eyes with evil and deception whatever he tried tobe whatever he engaged in the evil and falsehood of it repulsed himand blocked every path of activity yet he had to live and to findoccupation it was too dreadful to be under the burden of theseinsoluble problems so he abandoned himself to any distraction in orderto forget them he frequented every kind of society drank much boughtpictures engaged in building and above allreadhe read and read everything that came to hand on coming home whilehis valets were still taking off his things he picked up a book andbegan to read from reading he passed to sleeping from sleeping togossip in drawing rooms of the club from gossip to carousals and womenfrom carousals back to gossip reading and wine drinking became moreand more a physical and also a moral necessity though the doctorswarned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for him he dranka great deal he was only quite at ease when having poured severalglasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he felt a pleasantwarmth in his body an amiability toward all his fellows and areadiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing itdeeply only after emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that theterribly tangled skein of life which previously had terrified him wasnot as dreadful as he had thought he was always conscious of someaspect of that skein as with a buzzing in his head after dinner orsupper he chatted or listened to conversation or read but under theinfluence of wine he said to himself it doesnt matter ill get itunraveled i have a solution ready but have no time nowill think itall out later on but the later on never camein the morning on an empty stomach all the old questions appeared asinsoluble and terrible as ever and pierre hastily picked up a book andif anyone came to see him he was gladsometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war whenentrenched under the enemys fire if they have nothing to do try hardto find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger to pierreall men seemed like those soldiers seeking refuge from life some inambition some in cards some in framing laws some in women some intoys some in horses some in politics some in sport some in wine andsome in governmental affairs nothing is trivial and nothing isimportant its all the sameonly to save oneself from it as best onecan thought pierre only not to see it that dreadful itat the beginning of winter prince nicholas bolkonski and his daughtermoved to moscow at that time enthusiasm for the emperor alexandersregime had weakened and a patriotic and antifrench tendency prevailedthere and this together with his past and his intellect and hisoriginality at once made prince nicholas bolkonski an object ofparticular respect to the moscovites and the center of the moscowopposition to the governmentthe prince had aged very much that year he showed marked signs ofsenility by a tendency to fall asleep forgetfulness of quite recentevents remembrance of remote ones and the childish vanity with whichhe accepted the role of head of the moscow opposition in spite of thisthe old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of respectfulvenerationespecially of an evening when he came in to tea in his oldfashioned coat and powdered wig and aroused by anyone told his abruptstories of the past or uttered yet more abrupt and scathing criticismsof the present for them all that oldfashioned house with its giganticmirrors prerevolution furniture powdered footmen and the sternshrewd old man himself a relic of the past century with his gentledaughter and the pretty frenchwoman who were reverently devoted to himpresented a majestic and agreeable spectacle but the visitors did notreflect that besides the couple of hours during which they saw theirhost there were also twentytwo hours in the day during which theprivate and intimate life of the house continuedlatterly that private life had become very trying for princess marythere in moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasurestalks withthe pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at bald hillsand shehad none of the advantages and pleasures of city life she did not goout into society everyone knew that her father would not let her goanywhere without him and his failing health prevented his going outhimself so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties shehad quite abandoned the hope of getting married she saw the coldnessand malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed theyoung men possible suitors who sometimes appeared at their house shehad no friends during this visit to moscow she had been disappointed inthe two who had been nearest to her mademoiselle bourienne with whomshe had never been able to be quite frank had now become unpleasant toher and for various reasons princess mary avoided her julie with whomshe had corresponded for the last five years was in moscow but provedto be quite alien to her when they met just then julie who by thedeath of her brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in moscowwas in the full whirl of society pleasures she was surrounded by youngmen who she fancied had suddenly learned to appreciate her worthjulie was at that stage in the life of a society woman when she feelsthat her last chance of marrying has come and that her fate must bedecided now or never on thursdays princess mary remembered with amournful smile that she now had no one to write to since juliewhosepresence gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week like theold emigre who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent hisevenings for years she regretted julies presence and having no one towrite to in moscow princess mary had no one to talk to no one to whomto confide her sorrow and much sorrow fell to her lot just then thetime for prince andrews return and marriage was approaching but hisrequest to her to prepare his father for it had not been carried out infact it seemed as if matters were quite hopeless for at every mentionof the young countess rostova the old prince who apart from that wasusually in a bad temper lost control of himself another lately addedsorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six yearold nephew to herconsternation she detected in herself in relation to little nicholassome symptoms of her fathers irritability however often she toldherself that she must not get irritable when teaching her nephew almostevery time that pointer in hand she sat down to show him the frenchalphabet she so longed to pour her own knowledge quickly and easilyinto the childwho was already afraid that auntie might at any momentget angrythat at his slightest inattention she trembled becameflustered and heated raised her voice and sometimes pulled him by thearm and put him in the corner having put him in the corner she wouldherself begin to cry over her cruel evil nature and little nicholasfollowing her example would sob and without permission would leave hiscorner come to her pull her wet hands from her face and comfort herbut what distressed the princess most of all was her fathersirritability which was always directed against her and had of lateamounted to cruelty had he forced her to prostrate herself to theground all night had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water itwould never have entered her mind to think her position hard but thisloving despotthe more cruel because he loved her and for that reasontormented himself and herknew how not merely to hurt and humiliate herdeliberately but to show her that she was always to blame foreverything of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented princessmary more than anything else this was his everincreasing intimacy withmademoiselle bourienne the idea that at the first moment of receivingthe news of his sons intentions had occurred to him in jestthat ifandrew got married he himself would marry bouriennehad evidentlypleased him and latterly he had persistently and as it seemed toprincess mary merely to offend her shown special endearments to thecompanion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter bydemonstrations of love of bourienneone day in moscow in princess marys presence she thought her fatherdid it purposely when she was there the old prince kissed mademoisellebouriennes hand and drawing her to him embraced her affectionatelyprincess mary flushed and ran out of the room a few minutes latermademoiselle bourienne came into princess marys room smiling and makingcheerful remarks in her agreeable voice princess mary hastily wipedaway her tears went resolutely up to mademoiselle bourienne andevidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angryhaste at the frenchwoman her voice breaking its horrible vileinhuman to take advantage of the weakness she did not finishleave my room she exclaimed and burst into sobsnext day the prince did not say a word to his daughter but she noticedthat at dinner he gave orders that mademoiselle bourienne should beserved first after dinner when the footman handed coffee and fromhabit began with the princess the prince suddenly grew furious threwhis stick at philip and instantly gave instructions to have himconscripted for the armyhe doesnt obey i said it twice and he doesnt obey she is thefirst person in this house shes my best friend cried the princeand if you allow yourself he screamed in a fury addressing princessmary for the first time to forget yourself again before her as youdared to do yesterday i will show you who is master in this house godont let me set eyes on you beg her pardonprincess mary asked mademoiselle bouriennes pardon and also herfathers pardon for herself and for philip the footman who had beggedfor her interventionat such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in hersoul and suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for hisspectacles in her presence fumbling near them and not seeing them orwould forget something that had just occurred or take a false step withhis failing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feeblenessor worst of all at dinner when there were no visitors to excite himwould suddenly fall asleep letting his napkin drop and his shaking headsink over his plate he is old and feeble and i dare to condemn himshe thought at such moments with a feeling of revulsion againstherselfin  there was living in moscow a french doctormetivierwho hadrapidly become the fashion he was enormously tall handsome amiable asfrenchmen are and was as all moscow said an extraordinarily cleverdoctor he was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor butas an equalprince nicholas had always ridiculed medicine but latterly onmademoiselle bouriennes advice

front door but he gave orders to admit no one andto invite to dinner only a small number a list of whom he gave toprincess marymetivier who came in the morning with his felicitations considered itproper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne  as he toldprincess mary and went in to see the prince it happened that on thatmorning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods he hadbeen going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyoneand pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to beunderstood himself princess mary well knew this mood of quiet absorbedquerulousness which generally culminated in a burst of rage and shewent about all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun andawaited the inevitable explosion until the doctors arrival the morninghad passed off safely after admitting the doctor princess mary satdown with a book in the drawing room near the door through which shecould hear all that passed in the study to force the guardat first she heard only metiviers voice then her fathers then bothvoices began speaking at the same time the door was flung open and onthe threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified metivierwith his shock of black hair and the prince in his dressing gown andfez his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes rolleddownwardsyou dont understand shouted the prince but i do french spy slaveof buonaparte spy get out of my house be off i tell youmetivier shrugging his shoulders went up to mademoiselle bourienne whoat the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining roomthe prince is not very well bile and rush of blood to the head keepcalm i will call again tomorrow said metivier and putting hisfingers to his lips he hastened awaythrough the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cryspies traitors traitors everywhere not a moments peace in my ownhouseafter metiviers departure the old prince called his daughter in andthe whole weight of his wrath fell on her she was to blame that a spyhad been admitted had he not told her yes told her to make a listand not to admit anyone who was not on that list then why was thatscoundrel admitted she was the cause of it all with her he said hecould not have a moments peace and could not die quietlyno maam we must part we must part understand that understand iti cannot endure any more he said and left the room then as ifafraid she might find some means of consolation he returned and tryingto appear calm added and dont imagine i have said this in a moment ofanger i am calm i have thought it over and it will be carried outwemust part so find some place for yourself but he could notrestrain himself and with the virulence of which only one who loves iscapable evidently suffering himself he shook his fists at her andscreamedif only some fool would marry her then he slammed the door sent formademoiselle bourienne and subsided into his studyat two oclock the six chosen guests assembled for dinnerthese gueststhe famous count rostopchin prince lopukhin with hisnephew general chatrov an old war comrade of the princes and of theyounger generation pierre and boris drubetskoyawaited the prince inthe drawing roomboris who had come to moscow on leave a few days before had beenanxious to be presented to prince nicholas bolkonski and had contrivedto ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made anexception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his housethe princes house did not belong to what is known as fashionablesociety but his little circlethough not much talked about in townwas one it was more flattering to be received in than any other borishad realized this the week before when the commanderinchief in hispresence invited rostopchin to dinner on st nicholas day androstopchin had replied that he could not comeon that day i always go to pay my devotions to the relics of princenicholas bolkonskioh yes yes replied the commanderinchief how is hethe small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty oldfashioneddrawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn gathering of acourt of justice all were silent or talked in low tones princenicholas came in serious and taciturn princess mary seemed even quieterand more diffident than usual the guests were reluctant to address herfeeling that she was in no mood for their conversation count rostopchinalone kept the conversation going now relating the latest town newsand now the latest political gossiplopukhin and the old general occasionally took part in the conversationprince bolkonski listened as a presiding judge receives a report onlynow and then silently or by a brief word showing that he took heed ofwhat was being reported to him the tone of the conversation was such asindicated that no one approved of what was being done in the politicalworld incidents were related evidently confirming the opinion thateverything was going from bad to worse but whether telling a story orgiving an opinion the speaker always stopped or was stopped at thepoint beyond which his criticism might touch the sovereign himselfat dinner the talk turned on the latest political news napoleonsseizure of the duke of oldenburgs territory and the russian notehostile to napoleon which had been sent to all the european courtsbonaparte treats europe as a pirate does a captured vessel said countrostopchin repeating a phrase he had uttered several times before oneonly wonders at the longsuffering or blindness of the crowned headsnow the popes turn has come and bonaparte doesnt scruple to depose thehead of the catholic churchyet all keep silent our sovereign alonehas protested against the seizure of the duke of oldenburgs territoryand even count rostopchin paused feeling that he had reached thelimit beyond which censure was impossibleother territories have been offered in exchange for the duchy ofoldenburg said prince bolkonski he shifts the dukes about as i mightmove my serfs from bald hills to bogucharovo or my ryazan estatesthe duke of oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable strength ofcharacter and resignation remarked boris joining in respectfullyhe said this because on his journey from petersburg he had had the honorof being presented to the duke prince bolkonski glanced at the youngman as if about to say something in reply but changed his mindevidently considering him too youngi have read our protests about the oldenburg affair and was surprisedhow badly the note was worded remarked count rostopchin in the casualtone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to himpierre looked at rostopchin with naive astonishment not understandingwhy he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the notedoes it matter count how the note is worded he asked so long asits substance is forciblemy dear fellow with our five hundred thousand troops it should be easyto have a good style returned count rostopchinpierre now understood the counts dissatisfaction with the wording ofthe noteone would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up remarkedthe old prince there in petersburg they are always writingnot notesonly but even new laws my andrew there has written a whole volume oflaws for russia nowadays they are always writing and he laughedunnaturallythere was a momentary pause in the conversation the old general clearedhis throat to draw attentiondid you hear of the last event at the review in petersburg the figurecut by the new french ambassadoreh yes i heard something he said something awkward in his majestyspresencehis majesty drew attention to the grenadier division and to the marchpast continued the general and it seems the ambassador took nonotice and allowed himself to reply that we in france pay no attentionto such trifles the emperor did not condescend to reply at the nextreview they say the emperor did not once deign to address himall were silent on this fact relating to the emperor personally it wasimpossible to pass any judgmentimpudent fellows said the prince you know metivier i turned himout of my house this morning he was here they admitted him in spite ofmy request that they should let no one in he went on glancing angrilyat his daughterand he narrated his whole conversation with the french doctor and thereasons that convinced him that metivier was a spy though these reasonswere very insufficient and obscure no one made any rejoinderafter the roast champagne was served the guests rose to congratulatethe old prince princess mary too went round to himhe gave her a cold angry look and offered her his wrinkled cleanshaven cheek to kiss the whole expression of his face told her that hehad not forgotten the mornings talk that his decision remained inforce and only the presence of visitors hindered his speaking of it toher nowwhen they went into the drawing room where coffee was served the oldmen sat togetherprince nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on theimpending warhe said that our wars with bonaparte would be disastrous so long as wesought alliances with the germans and thrust ourselves into europeanaffairs into which we had been drawn by the peace of tilsit we oughtnot to fight either for or against austria our political interests areall in the east and in regard to bonaparte the only thing is to have anarmed frontier and a firm policy and he will never dare to cross therussian frontier as was the case in how can we fight the french prince said count rostopchin can wearm ourselves against our teachers and divinities look at our youthslook at our ladies the french are our gods paris is our kingdom ofheavenhe began speaking louder evidently to be heard by everyonefrench dresses french ideas french feelings there now you turnedmetivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a frenchman and ascoundrel but our ladies crawl after him on their knees i went to aparty last night and there out of five ladies three were romancatholics and had the popes indulgence for doing woolwork on sundaysand they themselves sit there nearly naked like the signboards at ourpublic baths if i may say so ah when one looks at our young peopleprince one would like to take peter the greats old cudgel out of themuseum and belabor them in the russian way till all the nonsense jumpsout of themall were silent the old prince looked at rostopchin with a smile andwagged his head approvinglywell goodby your excellency keep well said rostopchin getting upwith characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the princegoodbye my dear fellow his words are music i never tire ofhearing him said the old prince keeping hold of the hand and offeringhis cheek to be kissedfollowing rostopchins example the others also roseprincess mary as she sat listening to the old mens talk andfaultfinding understood nothing of what she heard she only wonderedwhether the guests had all observed her fathers hostile attitude towardher she did not even notice the special attentions and amiabilitiesshown her during dinner by boris drubetskoy who was visiting them forthe third time alreadyprincess mary turned with absentminded questioning look to pierre whohat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of the guests toapproach her after the old prince had gone out and they were left alonein the drawing roommay i stay a little

futuresisterinlaw as soon as the rostovs arrived and to try to accustom theold prince to herboris had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in petersburg so withthe same object in view he came to moscow there he wavered between thetwo richest heiresses julie and princess mary though princess marydespite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than julie hewithout knowing why felt awkward about paying court to her when theyhad last met on the old princes name day she had answered at randomall his attempts to talk sentimentally evidently not listening to whathe was sayingjulie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily though in amanner peculiar to herselfshe was twentyseven after the death of her brothers she had becomevery wealthy she was by now decidedly plain but thought herself notmerely as goodlooking as before but even far more attractive she wasconfirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a verywealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew the lessdangerous she became to men and the more freely they could associatewith her and avail themselves of her suppers soirees and the animatedcompany that assembled at her house without incurring any obligation aman who would have been afraid ten years before of going every day tothe house when there was a girl of seventeen there for fear ofcompromising her and committing himself would now go boldly every dayand treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintancethat winter the karagins house was the most agreeable and hospitable inmoscow in addition to the formal evening and dinner parties a largecompany chiefly of men gathered there every day supping at midnightand staying till three in the morning julie never missed a ball apromenade or a play her dresses were always of the latest fashion butin spite of that she seemed to be disillusioned about everything andtold everyone that she did not believe either in friendship or in loveor any of the joys of life and expected peace only yonder sheadopted the tone of one who has suffered a great disappointment like agirl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived byhim though nothing of the kind had happened to her she was regarded inthat light and had even herself come to believe that she had sufferedmuch in life this melancholy which did not prevent her amusingherself did not hinder the young people who came to her house frompassing the time pleasantly every visitor who came to the house paidhis tribute to the melancholy mood of the hostess and then amusedhimself with society gossip dancing intellectual games and boutsrimes which were in vogue at the karagins only a few of these youngmen among them boris entered more deeply into julies melancholy andwith these she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity ofall worldly things and to them she showed her albums filled withmournful sketches maxims and versesto boris julie was particularly gracious she regretted his earlydisillusionment with life offered him such consolation of friendship asshe who had herself suffered so much could render and showed him heralbum boris sketched two trees in the album and wrote rustic treesyour dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon meon another page he drew a tomb and wrotela mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille ah contre lesdouleurs il ny a pas dautre asile  death gives relief and death is peacefulah from suffering there is no other refugejulie said this was charmingthere is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy she saidto boris repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a bookit is a ray of light in the darkness a shade between sadness anddespair showing the possibility of consolationin reply boris wrote these linesaliment de poison dune ame trop sensible toi sans qui le bonheur meserait impossible tendre melancholie ah viens me consoler vienscalmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite et mele une douceur secretea ces pleurs que je sens couler poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul thou without whomhappiness would for me be impossible tender melancholy ah come toconsole me come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat and mingle asecret sweetness with these tears that i feel to be flowingfor boris julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp boris readpoor liza aloud to her and more than once interrupted the readingbecause of the emotions that choked him meeting at large gatheringsjulie and boris looked on one another as the only souls who understoodone another in a world of indifferent peopleanna mikhaylovna who often visited the karagins while playing cardswith the mother made careful inquiries as to julies dowry she was tohave two estates in penza and the nizhegorod forests anna mikhaylovnaregarded the refined sadness that united her son to the wealthy juliewith emotion and resignation to the divine willyou are always charming and melancholy my dear julie she said to thedaughter boris says his soul finds repose at your house he hassuffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive said she to themother ah my dear i cant tell you how fond i have grown of julielatterly she said to her son but who could help loving her she isan angelic being ah boris borisshe paused and how i pity hermother she went on today she showed me her accounts and letters frompenza they have enormous estates there and she poor thing has noone to help her and they do cheat her soboris smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother helaughed blandly at her naive diplomacy but listened to what she had tosay and sometimes questioned her carefully about the penza andnizhegorod estatesjulie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy adorer andwas ready to accept it but some secret feeling of repulsion for herfor her passionate desire to get married for her artificiality and afeeling of horror at renouncing the possibility of real love stillrestrained boris his leave was expiring he spent every day and wholedays at the karagins and every day on thinking the matter over toldhimself that he would propose tomorrow but in julies presence lookingat her red face and chin nearly always powdered her moist eyes andher expression of continual readiness to pass at once from melancholy toan unnatural rapture of married bliss boris could not utter thedecisive words though in imagination he had long regarded himself asthe possessor of those penza and nizhegorod estates and had apportionedthe use of the income from them julie saw boris indecision andsometimes the thought occurred to her that she was repulsive to him buther feminine selfdeception immediately supplied her with consolationand she told herself that he was only shy from love her melancholyhowever began to turn to irritability and not long before borisdeparture she formed a definite plan of action just as boris leave ofabsence was expiring anatole kuragin made his appearance in moscow andof course in the karagins drawing room and julie suddenly abandoningher melancholy became cheerful and very attentive to kuraginmy dear said anna mikhaylovna to her son i know from a reliablesource that prince vasili has sent his son to moscow to get him marriedto julie i am so fond of julie that i should be sorry for her what doyou think of it my dearthe idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that wholemonth of arduous melancholy service to julie and of seeing all therevenue from the penza estates which he had already mentally apportionedand put to proper use fall into the hands of another and especiallyinto the hands of that idiot anatole pained boris he drove to thekaragins with the firm intention of proposing julie met him in a gaycareless manner spoke casually of how she had enjoyed yesterdays balland asked when he was leaving though boris had come intentionally tospeak of his love and therefore meant to be tender he began speakingirritably of feminine inconstancy of how easily women can turn fromsadness to joy and how their moods depend solely on who happens to bepaying court to them julie was offended and replied that it was truethat a woman needs variety and the same thing over and over again wouldweary anyonethen i should advise you boris began wishing to sting her but atthat instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might have toleave moscow without having accomplished his aim and have vainly wastedhis effortswhich was a thing he never allowed to happenhe checked himself in the middle of the sentence lowered his eyes toavoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face and saidi did not come here at all to quarrel with you on the contraryhe glanced at her to make sure that he might go on her irritability hadsuddenly quite vanished and her anxious imploring eyes were fixed onhim with greedy expectation i can always arrange so as not to see heroften thought boris the affair has been begun and must be finishedhe blushed hotly raised his eyes to hers and saidyou know my feelings for youthere was no need to say more julies face shone with triumph and selfsatisfaction but she forced boris to say all that is said on suchoccasionsthat he loved her and had never loved any other woman morethan her she knew that for the penza estates and nizhegorod forests shecould demand this and she received what she demandedthe affianced couple no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom andmelancholy upon them planned the arrangements of a splendid house inpetersburg paid calls and

not nice to enter a family against a fatherswill one wants to do it peacefully and lovingly youre a clever girland youll know how to manage be kind and use your wits then all willbe wellnatasha remained silent from shyness marya dmitrievna supposed butreally because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her loveof prince andrew which seemed to her so apart from all human affairsthat no one could understand it she loved and knew prince andrew heloved her only and was to come one of these days and take her shewanted nothing moreyou see i have known him a long time and

answered reluctantlynext day by marya dmitrievnas advice count rostov took natasha tocall on prince nicholas bolkonski the count did not set out cheerfullyon this visit at heart he felt afraid he well remembered the lastinterview he had had with the old prince at the time of the enrollmentwhen in reply to an invitation to dinner he had had to listen to anangry reprimand for not having provided his full quota of men natashaon the other hand having put on her best gown was in the highestspirits they cant help liking me she thought everybody always hasliked me and i am so willing to do anything they wish so ready to befond of himfor being his fatherand of herfor being his sisterthat there is no reason for them not to like methey drove up to the gloomy old house on the vozdvizhenka and enteredthe vestibulewell the lord have mercy on us said the count half in jest half inearnest but natasha noticed that her father was flurried on enteringthe anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince andprincess were at homewhen they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among theservants the footman who had gone to announce them was stopped byanother in the large hall and they whispered to one another then amaidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something mentioningthe princess at last an old cross looking footman came and announcedto the rostovs that the prince was not receiving but that the princessbegged them to walk up the first person who came to meet the visitorswas mademoiselle bourienne she greeted the father and daughter withspecial politeness and showed them to the princess room the princesslooking excited and nervous her face flushed in patches ran in to meetthe visitors treading heavily and vainly trying to appear cordial andat ease from the first glance princess mary did not like natasha shethought her too fashionably dressed frivolously gay and vain she didnot at all realize that before having seen her future sisterinlaw shewas prejudiced against her by involuntary envy of her beauty youth andhappiness as well as by jealousy of her brothers love for her apartfrom this insuperable antipathy to her princess mary was agitated justthen because on the rostovs being announced the old prince had shoutedthat he did not wish to see them that princess mary might do so if shechose but they were not to be admitted to him she had decided toreceive them but feared lest the prince might at any moment indulge insome freak as he seemed much upset by the rostovs visitthere my dear princess ive brought you my songstress said thecount bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old princemight appear i am so glad you should get to know one another verysorry the prince is still ailing and after a few more commonplaceremarks he rose if youll allow me to leave my natasha in your handsfor a quarter of an hour princess ill drive round to see annasemenovna its quite near in the dogs square and then ill come backfor herthe count had devised this diplomatic ruse as he afterwards told hisdaughter to give the future sistersinlaw an opportunity to talk toone another freely but another motive was to avoid the danger ofencountering the old prince of whom he was afraid he did not mentionthis to his daughter but natasha noticed her fathers nervousness andanxiety and felt mortified by it she blushed for him grew stillangrier at having blushed and looked at the princess with a bold anddefiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody theprincess told the count that she would be delighted and only begged himto stay longer at anna semenovnas and he departeddespite the uneasy glances thrown at her by princess marywho wished tohave a ttette with natashamademoiselle bourienne remained in theroom and persistently talked about moscow amusements and theatersnatasha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in the anteroomby her fathers nervousness and by the unnatural manner of the princesswhoshe thoughtwas making a favor of receiving her and so everythingdispleased her she did not like princess mary whom she thought veryplain affected and dry natasha suddenly shrank into herself andinvoluntarily assumed an offhand air which alienated princess mary stillmore after five minutes of irksome constrained conversation theyheard the sound of slippered feet rapidly approaching princess marylooked frightenedthe door opened and the old prince in a dressing gown and a whitenightcap came inah madam he began madam countess countess rostova if i am notmistaken i beg you to excuse me to excuse me i did not knowmadam god is my witness i did not know you had honored us with avisit and i came in such a costume only to see my daughter i beg youto excuse me god is my witness i didnt know he repeatedstressing the word god so unnaturally and so unpleasantly thatprincess mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at herfather or at natashanor did the latter having risen and curtsied know what to domademoiselle bourienne alone smiled agreeablyi beg you to excuse me excuse me god is my witness i did not knowmuttered the old man and after looking natasha over from head to foothe went outmademoiselle bourienne was the first to recover herself after thisapparition and began speaking about the princes indisposition natashaand princess mary looked at one another in silence and the longer theydid so without saying what they wanted to say the greater grew theirantipathy to one anotherwhen the count returned natasha was impolitely pleased and hastened toget away at that moment she hated the stiff elderly princess whocould place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half anhour with her without once mentioning prince andrew i couldnt begintalking about him in the presence of that frenchwoman thought natashathe same thought was meanwhile tormenting princess mary she knew whatshe ought to have said to natasha but she had been unable to say itbecause mademoiselle bourienne was in the way and because withoutknowing why she felt it very difficult to speak of the marriage whenthe count was already leaving the room princess mary went up hurriedlyto natasha took her by the hand and said with a deep sighwait i mustnatasha glanced at her ironically without knowing whydear natalie said princess mary i want you to know that i am gladmy brother has found happinessshe paused feeling that she was not telling the truth natasha noticedthis and guessed its reasoni think princess it is not convenient to speak of that now she saidwith external dignity and coldness though she felt the tears chokingherwhat have i said and what have i done thought she as soon as she wasout of the roomthey waited a long time for natasha to come to dinner that day she satin her room crying like a child blowing her nose and sobbing sonyastood beside her kissing her hairnatasha what is it about she asked what do they matter to you itwill all pass natashabut if you only knew how offensive it was as if idont talk about it natasha it wasnt your fault so why should youmind kiss me said sonyanatasha raised her head and kissing her friend on the lips pressed herwet face against heri cant tell you i dont know no ones to blame said natashaitsmy fault but it all hurts terribly oh why doesnt he comeshe came in to dinner with red eyes marya dmitrievna who knew how theprince had received the rostovs pretended not to notice how upsetnatasha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the count andthe other gueststhat evening the rostovs went to the opera for which marya dmitrievnahad taken a boxnatasha did not want to go but could not refuse marya dmitrievnas kindoffer which was intended expressly for her when she came ready dressedinto the ballroom to await her father and looking in the large mirrorthere saw that she was pretty very pretty she felt even more sad butit was a sweet tender sadnesso god if he were here now i would not behave as i did then butdifferently i would not be silly and afraid of things i would simplyembrace him cling to him and make him look at me with those searchinginquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me and then i wouldmake him laugh as he used to laugh and his eyeshow i see those eyesthought natasha and what do his father and sister matter to me i lovehim alone him him with that face and those eyes with his smilemanly and yet childlike no i had better not think of him not thinkof him but forget him quite forget him for the present i cant bearthis waiting and i shall cry in a minute and she turned away from theglass making an effort not to cry and how can sonya love nicholas socalmly and quietly and wait so long and so patiently thought shelooking at sonya who also came in quite ready with a fan in her handno shes altogether different i cantnatasha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was notenough for her to love and know she was beloved she wanted now atonce to embrace the man she loved to speak and hear from him words oflove such as filled her heart while she sat in the carriage beside herfather pensively watching the lights of the street lamps flickering onthe frozen window she felt still sadder and more in love and forgotwhere she was going and with whom having fallen into the line ofcarriages the rostovs carriage drove up to the theater its wheelssqueaking over the snow natasha and sonya holding up their dressesjumped out quickly the count got out helped by the footmen andpassing among men and women who were entering and the program sellersthey all three went along the corridor to the first row of boxesthrough the closed doors the music was already audiblenatasha your hair whispered sonyaan attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies andopened the door of their box the music sounded louder and through thedoor rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms andshoulders and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms glittered beforetheir eyes a lady entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envyat natasha the curtain had not yet risen and the overture was beingplayed natasha smoothing her gown went in with sonya and sat downscanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite a sensation she had notexperienced for a long timethat of hundreds of eyes looking at herbare arms and necksuddenly affected her both agreeably anddisagreeably and called up a whole crowd of memories desires andemotions associated with that feelingthe two remarkably pretty girls natasha and sonya with count rostovwho had not been seen in moscow for a long time attracted generalattention moreover everybody knew vaguely of natashas engagement toprince andrew and knew that the rostovs had lived in the country eversince and all looked with curiosity at a fiancee who was making one ofthe best matches in russianatashas looks as everyone told her had improved in the country andthat evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty shestruck those who saw her by her fullness of life and beauty combinedwith her indifference to everything about her her black eyes looked atthe crowd without seeking anyone and her delicate arm bare to abovethe elbow lay on the velvet edge of the box while evidentlyunconsciously she opened and closed her hand in time to the musiccrumpling her program look theres alenina said sonya with hermother isnt itdear me michael kirilovich has grown still stouter remarked thecountlook at our anna mikhaylovnawhat a headdress she has onthe karagins julieand boris with them one can see at once thattheyre engageddrubetskoy has proposedoh yes i heard it today said shinshin coming into the rostovs boxnatasha looked in the direction in which her fathers eyes were turnedand saw julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her faceand a string of pearls round her thick red neckwhich natasha knew wascovered with powder behind them wearing a smile and leaning over withan ear to julies mouth was boris handsome smoothly brushed head helooked at the rostovs from under his brows and said something smilingto his betrothedthey are talking about us about me and him thought natasha and heno doubt is calming her jealousy of me they neednt trouble themselvesif only they knew how little i am concerned about any of thembehind them sat anna mikhaylovna wearing a green headdress and with ahappy look of resignation to the will of god on her face their box waspervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which natasha knew sowell and liked so much she turned away and suddenly remembered all thathad been so humiliating in her mornings visitwhat right has he not to wish to receive me into his family oh betternot think of itnot till he comes back she told herself and beganlooking at the faces some strange and some familiar in the stalls inthe front in the very center leaning back against the orchestra railstood dolokhov in a persian dress his curly hair brushed up into a hugeshock he stood in full view of the audience well aware that he wasattracting everyones attention yet as much at ease as though he werein his own room around him thronged moscows most brilliant young menwhom he evidently dominatedthe count laughing nudged the blushing sonya and pointed to her formeradorerdo you recognize him said he and where has he sprung from heasked turning to shinshin didnt he vanish somewherehe did replied shinshin he was in the caucasus and ran away fromthere they say he has been acting as minister to some ruling prince inpersia where he killed the shahs brother now all the moscow ladiesare mad about him its dolokhov the persian that does it we neverhear a word but dolokhov is mentioned they swear by him they offer himto you as they would a dish of choice sterlet dolokhov and anatolekuragin have turned all our ladies headsa tall beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposedplump white shoulders and neck round which she wore a double string oflarge pearls entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk dressand took a long time settling into her placenatasha involuntarily gazed at that neck those shoulders and pearlsand coiffure and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the pearlswhile natasha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the ladylooked round and meeting the counts eyes nodded to him and smiledshe was the countess bezukhova pierres wife and the count who kneweveryone in society leaned over and spoke to herhave you been here long countess he inquired ill call ill callto kiss your hand im here on business and have brought my girls withme they say semenova acts marvelously count pierre never used toforget us is he hereyes he meant to look in answered helene and glanced attentively atnatashacount rostov resumed his seathandsome isnt she he whispered to natashawonderful answered natasha shes a woman one could easily fall inlove withjust then the last chords of the overture were heard and the conductortapped with his stick some latecomers took their seats in the stallsand the curtain roseas soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent andall the men old and young in uniform and evening dress and all thewomen with gems on their bare flesh turned their whole attention witheager curiosity to the stage natasha too began to look at itthe floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards at the sides was somepainted cardboard representing trees and at the back was a clothstretched over boards in the center of the stage sat some girls in redbodices and white skirts one very fat girl in a white silk dress satapart on a low bench to the back of which a piece of green cardboardwas glued they all sang something when they had finished their songthe girl in white went up to the prompters box and a man with tightsilk trousers over his stout legs and holding a plume and a daggerwent up to her and began singing waving his arms aboutfirst the man in the tight trousers sang alone then she sang then theyboth paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand ofthe girl in white obviously awaiting the beat to start singing withher they sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping andshouting while the man and woman on the stagewho represented loversbegan smiling spreading out their arms and bowingafter her life in the country and in her present serious mood all thisseemed grotesque and amazing to natasha she could not follow the operanor even listen to the music she saw only the painted cardboard and thequeerly dressed men and women who moved spoke and sang so strangely inthat brilliant light she knew what it was all meant to represent butit was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamedfor the actors and then amused at them she looked at the faces of theaudience seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity sheherself experienced but they all seemed attentive to what was happeningon the stage and expressed delight which to natasha seemed feigned isuppose it has to be like this she thought she kept looking round inturn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at the seminudewomen in the boxes especially at helene in the next box whoapparently quite unclothedsat with a quiet tranquil smile not takingher eyes off the stage and feeling the bright light that flooded thewhole place and the warm air heated by the crowd natasha little bylittle began to pass into a state of intoxication she had notexperienced for a long while she did not realize who and where she wasnor what was going on before her as she looked and thought thestrangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through hermind the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box andsinging the air the actress was singing then she wished to touch withher fan an old gentleman sitting not far from her then to lean over tohelene and tickle herat a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song a doorleading to the stalls on the side nearest the rostovs box creaked andthe steps of a belated arrival were heard theres kuragin whisperedshinshin countess bezukhova turned smiling to the newcomer andnatasha following the direction of that look saw an exceptionallyhandsome adjutant approaching their box with a selfassured yetcourteous bearing this was anatole kuragin whom she had seen andnoticed long ago at the ball in petersburg he was now in an adjutantsuniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot he moved with a restrainedswagger which would have been ridiculous had he not been so goodlookingand had his handsome face not worn such an expression of goodhumoredcomplacency and gaiety though the performance was proceeding he walkeddeliberately down the carpeted gangway his sword and spurs slightlyjingling and his handsome perfumed head held high having looked atnatasha he approached his sister laid his well gloved hand on the edgeof her box nodded to her and leaning forward asked a question with amotion toward natashamais charmante said he evidently referring to natasha who did notexactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of hislips then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat downbeside dolokhov nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand waythat dolokhov whom others treated so fawningly he winked at him gailysmiled and rested his foot against the orchestra screenhow like the brother is to the sister remarked the count and howhandsome they both areshinshin lowering his voice began to tell the count of some intrigueof kuragins in moscow and natasha tried to overhear it just because hehad said she was charmantethe first act was over in the stalls everyone began moving about goingout and coming inboris came to the rostovs box received their congratulations verysimply and raising his eyebrows with an absentminded smile conveyed tonatasha and sonya his fiancees invitation to her wedding and wentaway natasha with a gay coquettish smile talked to him andcongratulated on his approaching wedding that same boris with whom shehad formerly been in love in the state of intoxication she was ineverything seemed simple and naturalthe scantily clad helene smiled at everyone in the same way and natashagave boris a similar smilehelenes box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the mostdistinguished and intellectual men who seemed to vie with one anotherin their wish to let everyone see that they knew herduring the whole of that entracte kuragin stood with dolokhov in frontof the orchestra partition looking at the rostovs box natasha knew hewas talking about her and this afforded her pleasure she even turned sothat he should see her profile in what she thought was its most becomingaspect before the beginning of the second act pierre appeared in thestalls the rostovs had not seen him since their arrival his facelooked sad and he had grown still stouter since natasha last saw himhe passed up to the front rows not noticing anyone anatole went up tohim and began speaking to him looking at and indicating the rostovsbox on seeing natasha pierre grew animated and hastily passing betweenthe rows came toward their box when he got there he leaned on hiselbows and smiling talked to her for a long time while conversingwith pierre natasha heard a mans voice in countess bezukhovas box andsomething told her it was kuragin she turned and their eyes met almostsmiling he gazed straight into her eyes with such an enrapturedcaressing look that it seemed strange to be so near him to look at himlike that to be so sure he admired her and not to be acquainted withhimin the second act there was scenery representing tombstones there was around hole in the canvas to represent the moon shades were raised overthe footlights and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while manypeople appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holdingthings like daggers in their hands they began waving their arms thensome other people ran in and began dragging away the maiden who had beenin white and was now in light blue they did not drag her away at oncebut sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off andbehind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and everyoneknelt down and sang a prayer all these things were repeatedlyinterrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audienceduring this act every time natasha looked toward the stalls she sawanatole kuragin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair staringat her she was pleased to see that he was captivated by her and it didnot occur to her that there was anything wrong in itwhen the second act was over countess bezukhova rose turned to therostovs boxher whole bosom completely exposedbeckoned the old countwith a gloved finger and paying no attention to those who had enteredher box began talking to him with an amiable smiledo make me acquainted with your charming daughters said she thewhole town is singing their praises and i dont even know themnatasha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess she was so pleasedby praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with pleasurei want to become a moscovite too now said helene how is it yourenot ashamed to bury such pearls in the countrycountess bezukhova quite deserved her reputation of being a fascinatingwoman she could say what she did not thinkespecially what wasflatteringquite simply and naturallydear count you must let me look after your daughters though i am notstaying here long this timenor are youi will try to amuse them ihave already heard much of you in petersburg and wanted to get to knowyou said she to natasha with her stereotyped and lovely smile i hadheard about you from my page drubetskoy have you heard he is gettingmarried and also from my husbands friend bolkonski prince andrewbolkonski she went on with special emphasis implying that she knew ofhis relation to natasha to get better acquainted she asked that one ofthe young ladies should come into her box for the rest of theperformance and natasha moved over to itthe scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candleswere burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on thewalls in the middle stood what were probably a king and a queen theking waved his right arm and evidently nervous sang something badlyand sat down on a crimson throne the maiden who had been first in whiteand then in light blue now wore only a smock and stood beside thethrone with her hair down she sang something mournfully addressing thequeen but the king waved his arm severely and men and women with barelegs came in from both sides and began dancing all together then theviolins played very shrilly and merrily and one of the women with thickbare legs and thin arms separating from the others went behind thewings adjusted her bodice returned to the middle of the stage andbegan jumping and striking one foot rapidly against the other in thestalls everyone clapped and shouted bravo then one of the men wentinto a corner of the stage the cymbals and horns in the orchestrastruck up more loudly and this man with bare legs jumped very high andwaved his feet about very rapidly he was duport who received sixtythousand rubles a year for this art everybody in the stalls boxesand galleries began clapping and shouting with all their might and theman stopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides then other menand women danced with bare legs then the king again shouted to thesound of music and they all began singing but suddenly a storm cameon chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were heard in theorchestra everyone ran off again dragging one of their number awayand the curtain dropped once more there was a terrible noise andclatter among the audience and with rapturous faces everyone beganshouting duport duport duport natasha no longer thought thisstrange she looked about with pleasure smiling joyfullyisnt duport delightful helene asked heroh yes replied natashaduring the entracte a whiff of cold air came into helenes box thedoor opened and anatole entered stooping and trying not to brushagainst anyonelet me introduce my brother to you said helene her eyes shiftinguneasily from natasha to anatolenatasha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officerand smiled at him over her bare shoulder anatole who was as handsomeat close quarters as at a distance sat down beside her and told her hehad long wished to have this happinessever since the naryshkins ballin fact at which he had had the wellremembered pleasure of seeing herkuragin was much more sensible and simple with women than among men hetalked boldly and naturally and natasha was strangely and agreeablystruck by the fact that there was nothing formidable in this man aboutwhom there was so much talk but that on the contrary his smile was mostnaive cheerful and goodnaturedkuragin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at aprevious performance semenova had fallen down on the stageand do you know countess he said suddenly addressing her as an oldfamiliar acquaintance we are getting up a costume tournament youought to take part in it it will be great fun we shall all meet at thekaragins please come no really eh said hewhile saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face herneck and her bare arms natasha knew for certain that he was enrapturedby her this pleased her yet his presence made her feel constrained andoppressed when she was not looking at him she felt that he was lookingat her shoulders and she involuntarily caught his eye so that he shouldlook into hers rather than this but looking into his eyes she wasfrightened realizing that there was not that barrier of modesty she hadalways felt between herself and other men she did not know how it wasthat within five minutes she had come to feel herself terribly near tothis man when she turned away she feared he might seize her from behindby her bare arm and kiss her on the neck they spoke of most ordinarythings yet she felt that they were closer to one another than she hadever been to any man natasha kept turning to helene and to her fatheras if asking what it all meant but helene was engaged in conversationwith a general and did not answer her look and her fathers eyes saidnothing but what they always said having a good time well im gladof itduring one of these moments of awkward silence when anatoles prominenteyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her natasha to break thesilence asked him how he liked moscow she asked the question andblushed she felt all the time that by talking to him she was doingsomething improper anatole smiled as though to encourage herat first i did not like it much because what makes a town pleasant cesont les jolies femmes  isnt that so but now i like it very muchindeed he said looking at her significantly youll come to thecostume tournament countess do come and putting out his hand to herbouquet and dropping his voice he added you will be the prettiestthere do come dear countess and give me this flower as a pledge are the pretty womennatasha did not understand what he was saying any more than he didhimself but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improperintention she did not know what to say and turned away as if she hadnot heard his remark but as soon as she had turned away she felt thathe was there behind so close behind herhow is he now confused angry ought i to put it right she askedherself and she could not refrain from turning round she lookedstraight into his eyes and his nearness selfassurance and the goodnatured tenderness of his smile vanquished her she smiled just as hewas doing gazing straight into his eyes and again she felt with horrorthat no barrier lay between him and herthe curtain rose again anatole left the box serene and gay natashawent back to her father in the other box now quite submissive to theworld she found herself in all that was going on before her now seemedquite natural but on the other hand all her previous thoughts of herbetrothed of princess mary or of life in the country did not oncerecur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote pastin the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his armabout till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he disappeareddown below that was the only part of the fourth act that natasha sawshe felt agitated and tormented and the cause of this was kuragin whomshe could not help watching as they were leaving the theater anatolecame up to them called their carriage and helped them in as he wasputting natasha in he pressed her arm above the elbow agitated andflushed she turned round he was looking at her with glittering eyessmiling tenderlyonly after she had reached home was natasha able clearly to think overwhat had happened to her and suddenly remembering prince andrew she washorrified and at tea to which all had sat down after the opera shegave a loud exclamation flushed and ran out of the roomo god i am lost she said to herself how could i let him she satfor a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to realizewhat had happened to her but was unable either to understand what hadhappened or what she felt everything seemed dark obscure andterrible there in that enormous illuminated theater where the barelegged duport in a tinseldecorated jacket jumped about to the musicon wet boards and young girls and old men and the nearly naked helenewith her proud calm smile rapturously cried bravothere in thepresence of that helene it had all seemed clear and simple but nowalone by herself it was incomprehensible what is it what was thatterror i felt of him what is this gnawing of conscience i am feelingnow she thoughtonly to the old countess at night in bed could natasha have told all shewas feeling she knew that sonya with her severe and simple views wouldeither not understand it at all or would be horrified at such aconfession so natasha tried to solve what was torturing her by herselfam i spoiled for andrews love or not she asked herself and withsoothing irony replied what a fool i am to ask that what did happento me nothing i have done nothing i didnt lead him on at all nobodywill know and i shall never see him again she told herself so it isplain that nothing has happened and there is nothing to repent of andandrew can love me still but why still o god why isnt he herenatasha quieted herself for a moment but again some instinct told herthat though all this was true and though nothing had happened yet theformer purity of her love for prince andrew had perished and again inimagination she went over her whole conversation with kuragin and againsaw the face gestures and tender smile of that bold handsome man whenhe pressed her armanatole kuragin was staying in moscow because his father had sent himaway from petersburg where he had been spending twenty thousand rublesa year in cash besides running up debts for as much more which hiscreditors demanded from his fatherhis father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for thelast time but only on condition that he went to moscow as adjutant tothe commanderinchiefa post his father had procured for himandwould at last try to make a good match there he indicated to himprincess mary and julie karaginaanatole consented and went to moscow where he put up at pierres housepierre received him unwillingly at first but got used to him after awhile sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals and gave himmoney under the guise of loansas shinshin had remarked from the time of his arrival anatole hadturned the heads of the moscow ladies especially by the fact that heslighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and frenchactresseswith the chief of whom mademoiselle george he was said tobe on intimate relations he had never missed a carousal at danilovs orother moscow revelers drank whole nights through outvying everyoneelse and was at all the balls and parties of the best society therewas talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies and he flirted with afew of them at the balls but he did not run after the unmarried girlsespecially the rich heiresses who were most of them plain there was aspecial reason for this as he had got married two years beforea factknown only to his most intimate friends at that time while with hisregiment in poland a polish landowner of small means had forced him tomarry his daughter anatole had very soon abandoned his wife and for apayment which he agreed to send to his fatherinlaw had arranged to befree to pass himself off as a bacheloranatole was always content with his position with himself and withothers he was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that it wasimpossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he hadnever in his life done anything base he was incapable of consideringhow his actions might affect others or what the consequences of this orthat action of his might be he was convinced that as a duck is so madethat it must live in water so god had made him such that he must spendthirty thousand rubles a year and always occupy a prominent position insociety he believed this so firmly that others looking at him werepersuaded of it too and did not refuse him either a leading place insociety or money which he

couldhe be accused of ambition more than once he had vexed his father byspoiling his own career and he laughed at distinctions of all kinds hewas not mean and did not refuse anyone who asked of him all he caredabout was gaiety and women and as according to his ideas there wasnothing dishonorable in these tastes and he was incapable ofconsidering what the gratification of his tastes entailed for others hehonestly considered himself irreproachable sincerely despised roguesand bad people and with a tranquil conscience carried his head highrakes those male magdalenes have a secret feeling of innocence similarto that which female magdalenes have based on the same hope offorgiveness all will be forgiven her for she loved much and all willbe forgiven him for he enjoyed muchdolokhov who had reappeared that year in moscow after his exile and hispersian adventures and was leading a life of luxury gambling anddissipation associated with his old petersburg comrade kuragin and madeuse of him for his own endsanatole was sincerely fond of dolokhov for his cleverness and audacitydolokhov who needed anatole kuragins name position and connectionsas a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set made use of himand amused himself at his expense without letting the other feel itapart from the advantage he derived from anatole the very process ofdominating anothers will was in itself a pleasure a habit and anecessity to dolokhovnatasha had made a strong impression on kuragin at supper after theopera he described to dolokhov with the air of a connoisseur theattractions of her arms shoulders feet and hair and expressed hisintention of making love to her anatole had no notion and was incapableof considering what might come of such lovemaking as he never had anynotion of

natasha guessed they were talking about the oldprince and planning something and this disquieted and offended her shewas expecting prince andrew any moment and twice that day sent amanservant to the vozdvizhenka to ascertain whether he had come he hadnot arrived she suffered more now than during her first days in moscowto her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasantrecollection of her interview with princess mary and the old prince anda fear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause shecontinually fancied that either he would never come or that somethingwould happen to her before he came she could no longer think of him byherself calmly and continuously as she had done before as soon as shebegan to think of him the recollection of the old prince of princessmary of the theater and of kuragin mingled with her thoughts thequestion again presented itself whether she was not guilty whether shehad not already broken faith with prince andrew and again she foundherself recalling to the minutest detail every word every gesture andevery shade in the play of expression on the face of the man who hadbeen able to arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifyingfeeling to the family natasha seemed livelier than usual but she wasfar less tranquil and happy than beforeon sunday morning marya dmitrievna invited her visitors to mass at herparish churchthe church of the assumption built over the graves ofvictims of the plaguei dont like those fashionable churches she said evidently pridingherself on her independence of thought god is the same

to church ather table there were extra dishes at dinner and the servants had vodkaand roast goose or suckling pig but in nothing in the house was theholiday so noticeable as in marya dmitrievnas broad stern face whichon that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivityafter mass when they had finished their coffee in the dining room wherethe loose covers had been removed from the furniture a servantannounced that the carriage was ready and marya dmitrievna rose with astern air she wore her holiday shawl in which she paid calls andannounced that she was going to see prince nicholas bolkonski to have anexplanation with him about natashaafter she had gone a dressmaker from madame suppertroguet waited onthe rostovs and natasha very glad of this diversion having shutherself into a room adjoining the drawing room occupied herself tryingon the new dresses just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves andonly tacked together and was turning her head to see in the glass howthe back fitted she heard in the drawing room the animated sounds ofher fathers voice and anothersa womansthat made her flush it washelene natasha had not time to take off the bodice before the dooropened and countess bezukhova dressed in a purple velvet gown with ahigh collar came into the room beaming with goodhumored amiablesmilesoh my enchantress she cried to the blushing natasha charming nothis is

folds of her velvet dress picturesquely shedid not cease chattering goodnaturedly and gaily continually praisingnatashas beauty she looked at natashas dresses and praised them aswell as a new dress of her own made of metallic gauze which she hadreceived from paris and advised natasha to have one like itbut anything suits you my charmer she remarkeda smile of pleasure never left natashas face she felt happy and as ifshe were blossoming under the praise of this dear countess bezukhova whohad formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and important and was nowso kind to her natasha brightened up and felt almost in love with thiswoman who was so beautiful and so kind helene for her part wassincerely delighted with natasha and wished to give her a good timeanatole had asked her to bring him and natasha together and she wascalling on the rostovs for that purpose the idea of throwing herbrother and natasha together amused herthough at one time in petersburg she had been annoyed with natasha fordrawing boris away she did not think of that now and in her own wayheartily wished natasha well as she was leaving the rostovs she calledher protegee asidemy brother dined with me yesterdaywe nearly died of laughterhe atenothing and kept sighing for you my charmer he is madly quite madlyin love with you my dearnatasha blushed scarlet when she heard thishow she blushes how she blushes my

terrible now seemedsimple and natural and she is such a grande dame so kind andevidently likes me so much and why not enjoy myself thought natashagazing at helene with wideopen wondering eyesmarya dmitrievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious havingevidently suffered a defeat at the old princes she was still tooagitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly inanswer to the counts inquiries she replied that things were all rightand that she would tell about it next day on hearing of countessbezukhovas visit and the invitation for that evening marya dmitrievnaremarkedi dont care to have anything to do with bezukhova and dont advise youto however if youve promisedgo it will divert your thoughts sheadded addressing natashacount rostov took the girls to countess bezukhovas there were a goodmany people there but nearly all strangers to natasha count rostov wasdispleased to see that the company consisted almost entirely of men andwomen known for the freedom of their conduct mademoiselle george wasstanding in a corner of the drawing room surrounded by young men therewere several frenchmen present among them metivier who from the timehelene reached moscow had been an intimate in her house the countdecided not to sit down to cards or let his girls out of his sight andto get away as soon as mademoiselle georges performance was overanatole was at the door evidently on the lookout for the rostovsimmediately after greeting the count he went up to natasha and followedher as soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling she hadhad at the operagratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear atthe absence of a moral barrier between themhelene welcomed natasha delightedly and was loud in admiration of herbeauty and her dress soon after their arrival mademoiselle george wentout of the room to change her costume in the drawing room people beganarranging the chairs and taking their seats anatole moved a chair fornatasha and was about to sit down beside her but the count who neverlost sight of her took the seat himself anatole sat down behind hermademoiselle george with her bare fat dimpled arms and a red shawldraped over one shoulder came into the space left vacant for her andassumed an unnatural pose enthusiastic whispering was audiblemademoiselle george looked sternly and gloomily at the audience andbegan reciting some french verses describing her guilty love for herson in some places she raised her voice in others she whisperedlifting her head triumphantly sometimes she paused and uttered hoarsesounds rolling her eyesadorable divine delicious was heard from every sidenatasha looked at the fat actress but neither saw nor heard norunderstood anything of what went on before her she only felt herselfagain completely borne away into this strange senseless worldso remotefrom her old worlda world in which it was impossible to know what wasgood or bad reasonable or senseless behind her sat anatole andconscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense ofexpectancyafter the first monologue the whole company rose and surroundedmademoiselle george expressing their enthusiasmhow beautiful she is natasha remarked to her father who had alsorisen and was moving through the crowd toward the actressi dont think so when i look at you said anatole following natashahe said this at a moment when she alone could hear him you areenchanting from the moment i saw you i have never ceasedcome come natasha said the count as he turned back for hisdaughter how beautiful she is natasha without saying anythingstepped up to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiringeyesafter giving several recitations mademoiselle george left and countessbezukhova asked her visitors into the ballroomthe count wished to go home but helene entreated him not to spoil herimprovised ball and the rostovs stayed on anatole asked natasha for avalse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand and told her shewas bewitching and that he loved her during the ecossaise which shealso danced with him anatole said nothing when they happened to be bythemselves but merely gazed at her natasha lifted her frightened eyesto him but there was such confident tenderness in his affectionate lookand smile that she could not whilst looking at him say what she had tosay she lowered her eyesdont say such things to me i am betrothed and love another she saidrapidly she glanced at himanatole was not upset or pained by what she had saiddont speak to me of that what can i do said he i tell you i ammadly madly in love with you is it my fault that you areenchanting its our turn to beginnatasha animated and excited looked about her with wideopenfrightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual she understood hardlyanything that went on that evening they danced the ecossaise and thegrossvater her father asked her to come home but she begged to remainwherever she went and whomever she was speaking to she felt his eyesupon her later on she recalled how she had asked her father to let hergo to the dressing room to rearrange her dress that helene had followedher and spoken laughingly of her brothers love and that she again metanatole in the little sitting room helene had disappeared leaving themalone and anatole had taken her hand and said in a tender voicei cannot come to visit you but is it possible that i shall never seeyou i love you madly can i never and blocking her path hebrought his face close to hershis large glittering masculine eyes were so close to hers that she sawnothing but themnatalie he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands beingpainfully pressed nataliei dont understand i have nothing to say her eyes repliedburning lips were pressed to hers and at the same instant she feltherself released and helenes footsteps and the rustle of her dresswere heard in the room natasha looked round at her and then red andtrembling threw a frightened look of inquiry at anatole and movedtoward the doorone word just one for gods sake cried anatoleshe paused she so wanted a word from him that would explain to her whathad happened and to which she could find no answernatalie just a word only one he kept repeating evidently notknowing what to say and he repeated it till helene came up to themhelene returned with natasha to the drawing room the rostovs went awaywithout staying for supperafter reaching home natasha did not sleep all night she was tormentedby the insoluble question whether she loved anatole or prince andrewshe loved prince andrewshe remembered distinctly how deeply she lovedhim but she also loved anatole of that there was no doubt else howcould all this have happened thought she if after that i couldreturn his smile when saying goodby if i was able to let it come tothat it means that i loved him from the first it means that he iskind noble and splendid and i could not help loving him what am i todo if i love him and the other one too she asked herself unable tofind an answer to these terrible questionsmorning came with its cares and bustle everyone got up and began tomove about and talk dressmakers came again marya dmitrievna appearedand they were called to breakfast natasha kept looking uneasily ateverybody with wideopen eyes as if wishing to intercept every glancedirected toward her and tried to appear the same as usualafter breakfast which was her best time marya dmitrievna sat down inher armchair and called natasha and the count to herwell friends i have now thought the whole matter over and this is myadvice she began yesterday as you know i went to see princebolkonski well i had a talk with him he took it into his head tobegin shouting but i am not one to be shouted down i said what i hadto saywell and he asked the counthe hes crazy he did not want to listen but whats the use oftalking as it is we have worn the poor girl out said maryadmitrievna my advice to you is finish your business and go back hometo otradnoe and wait thereoh no exclaimed natashayes go back said marya dmitrievna and wait there if yourbetrothed comes here nowthere will be no avoiding a quarrel but alonewith the old man he will talk things over and then come on to youcount rostov approved of this suggestion appreciating itsreasonableness if the old man came round it would be all the better tovisit him in moscow or at bald hills later on and if not the weddingagainst his wishes could only be arranged at otradnoethat is perfectly true and i am sorry i went to see him and took hersaid the old countno why be sorry being here you had to pay your respects but if hewontthats his affair said marya dmitrievna looking for somethingin her reticule besides the trousseau is ready so there is nothingto wait for and what is not ready ill send after you though i dontlike letting you go it is the best way so go with gods blessinghaving found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it tonatasha it was a letter from princess maryshe has written to you how she torments herself poor thing shesafraid you might think that she does not like youbut she doesnt like me said natashadont talk nonsense cried marya dmitrievnai shant believe anyone i know she doesnt like me replied natashaboldly as she took the letter and her face expressed a cold and angryresolution that caused marya dmitrievna to look at her more intently andto frowndont answer like that my good girl she said what i say is truewrite an answer natasha did not reply and went to her own room to readprincess marys letterprincess mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding thathad occurred between them whatever her fathers feelings might be shebegged natasha to believe that she could not help loving her as the onechosen by her brother for whose happiness she was ready to sacrificeeverythingdo not think however she wrote that my father is illdisposedtoward you he is an invalid and an old man who must be forgiven but heis good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his son happyprincess mary went on to ask natasha to fix a time when she could seeher againafter reading the letter natasha sat down at the writing table to answerit dear princess she wrote in french quickly and mechanically andthen paused what more could she write after all that had happened theevening before yes yes all that has happened and now all ischanged she thought as she sat with the letter she had begun beforeher must i break off with him must i really thats awful and toescape from these dreadful thoughts she went to sonya and began sortingpatterns with herafter dinner natasha went to her room and again took up princess marysletter can it be that it is all over she thought can it be thatall this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that wentbefore she recalled her love for prince andrew in all its formerstrength and at the same time felt that she loved kuragin she vividlypictured herself as prince andrews wife and the scenes of happinesswith him she had so often repeated in her imagination and at the sametime aglow with excitement recalled every detail of yesterdaysinterview with anatolewhy could that not be as well she sometimes asked herself in completebewilderment only so could i be completely happy but now i have tochoose and i cant be happy without either of them only she thoughtto tell prince andrew what has happened or to hide it from him are bothequally impossible but with that one nothing is spoiled but am ireally to abandon forever the joy of prince andrews love in which ihave lived so longplease miss whispered a maid entering the room with a mysteriousair a man told me to give you this and she handed natasha a letteronly for christs sake the girl went on as natasha withoutthinking mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter fromanatole of which without taking in a word she understood only that itwas a letter from himfrom the man she loved yes she loved him orelse how could that have happened which had happened and how could shehave a love letter from him in her handwith trembling hands natasha held that passionate love letter whichdolokhov had composed for anatole and as she read it she found in it anecho of all that she herself imagined she was feelingsince yesterday evening my fate has been sealed to be loved by you orto die there is no other way for me the letter began then he went onto say that he knew her parents would not give her to himfor thisthere were secret reasons he could reveal only to herbut that if sheloved him she need only say the word yes and no human power couldhinder their bliss love would conquer all he would steal her away andcarry her off to the ends of the earthyes yes i love him thought natasha reading the letter for thetwentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word ofitthat evening marya dmitrievna was going to the akharovs and proposed totake the girls with her natasha pleading a headache remained at homeon returning late in the evening sonya went to natashas room and toher surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa open on thetable beside her lay anatoles letter

vehemence with which peoplebewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned maryadmitrievna was to speak again but natasha cried outgo away go away you all hate and despise me and she threw herselfback on the sofamarya dmitrievna went on admonishing her for some time enjoining on herthat it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that nobodywould know anything about it if only natasha herself would undertake toforget it all and not let anyone see that something had happenednatasha did not reply nor did she sob any longer but she grew cold andhad a shivering fit marya dmitrievna put a pillow under her headcovered her with two quilts and herself brought her some limeflowerwater but natasha did not respond to herwell let her sleep said marya dmitrievna as she went out of the roomsupposing natasha to be asleepbut natasha was not asleep with pale face and fixed wideopen eyes shelooked straight before her all that night she did not sleep or weep anddid not speak to sonya who got up and went to her several timesnext day count rostov returned from his estate near moscow in time forlunch as he had promised he was in very good spirits the affair withthe purchaser was going on satisfactorily and there was nothing to keephim any longer in moscow away from the countess whom he missed maryadmitrievna met him and told him that natasha had been very unwell theday before and that they had sent for the doctor but that she wasbetter now natasha had not left her room that morning with compressedand parched lips and dry fixed eyes she sat at the window uneasilywatching the people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round atanyone who entered the room she was evidently expecting news of him andthat he would come or would write to herwhen the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the soundof a mans footstep and then her face resumed its cold and malevolentexpression she did not even get up to greet him what is the matterwith you my angel are you ill asked the countafter a moments silence natasha answered yes illin reply to the counts anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejectedand whether anything had happened to her betrothed she assured him thatnothing had happened and asked him not to worry marya dmitrievnaconfirmed natashas assurances that nothing had happened from thepretense of illness from his daughters distress and by theembarrassed faces of sonya and marya dmitrievna the count saw clearlythat something had gone wrong during his absence but it was so terriblefor him to think that anything disgraceful had happened to his beloveddaughter and he so prized his own cheerful tranquillity that heavoided inquiries and tried to assure himself that nothing particularlyhad happened and he was only dissatisfied that her indispositiondelayed their return to the countryfrom the day his wife arrived in moscow pierre had been intending to goaway somewhere so as not to be near her soon after the rostovs came tomoscow the effect natasha had on him made him hasten to carry out hisintention he went to tver to see joseph alexeevichs widow who hadlong since promised to hand over to him some papers of her deceasedhusbandswhen he returned to moscow pierre was handed a letter from maryadmitrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of greatimportance relating to andrew bolkonski and his betrothed pierre hadbeen avoiding natasha because it seemed to him that his feeling for herwas stronger than a married mans should be for his friends fianceeyet some fate constantly threw them togetherwhat can have happened and what can they want with me thought he ashe dressed to go to marya dmitrievnas if only prince andrew wouldhurry up and come and marry her thought he on his way to the houseon the tverskoy boulevard a familiar voice called to himpierre been back long someone shouted pierre raised his head in asleigh drawn by two gray trottinghorses that were bespattering thedashboard with snow anatole and his constant companion makarin dashedpast anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of militarydandies the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver collar and hishead slightly bent his face was fresh and rosy his whiteplumed hattilted to one side disclosed his curled and pomaded hair besprinkledwith powdery snowyes indeed thats a true sage thought pierre he sees nothingbeyond the pleasure of the moment nothing troubles him and so he isalways cheerful satisfied and serene what wouldnt i give to be likehim he thought enviouslyin marya dmitrievnas anteroom the footman who helped him off with hisfur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroomwhen he opened the ballroom door pierre saw natasha sitting at thewindow with a thin pale and spiteful face she glanced round at himfrowned and left the room with an expression of cold dignitywhat has happened asked pierre entering marya dmitrievnas roomfine doings answered dmitrievna for fiftyeight years have i livedin this world and never known anything so disgracefuland having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told himmarya dmitrievna informed him that natasha had refused prince andrewwithout her parents knowledge and that the cause of this was anatolekuragin into whose society pierres wife had thrown her and with whomnatasha had tried to elope during her fathers absence in order to bemarried secretlypierre raised his shoulders and listened openmouthed to what was toldhim scarcely able to believe his own ears that prince andrews deeplyloved affianced wifethe same natasha rostova who used to be socharmingshould give up bolkonski for that fool anatole who was alreadysecretly married as pierre knew and should be so in love with him asto agree to run away with him was something pierre could not conceiveand could not imaginehe could not reconcile the charming impression he had of natasha whomhe had known from a child with this new conception of her basenessfolly and cruelty he thought of his wife they are all alike hesaid to himself reflecting that he was not the only man unfortunateenough to be tied to a bad woman but still he pitied prince andrew tothe point of tears and sympathized with his wounded pride and the morehe pitied his friend the more did he think with contempt and even withdisgust of that natasha who had just passed him in the ballroom withsuch a look of cold dignity he did not know that natashas soul wasoverflowing with despair shame and humiliation and that it was nother fault that her face happened to assume an expression of calm dignityand severitybut how get married said pierre in answer to marya dmitrievna hecould not marryhe is marriedthings get worse from hour to hour ejaculated marya dmitrievna anice youth what a scoundrel and shes expecting himexpecting himsince yesterday she must be told then at least she wont go onexpecting himafter hearing the details of anatoles marriage from pierre and givingvent to her anger against anatole in words of abuse marya dmitrievnatold pierre why she had sent for him she was afraid that the count orbolkonski who might arrive at any moment if they knew of this affairwhich she hoped to hide from them might challenge anatole to a dueland she therefore asked pierre to tell his brotherinlaw in her name toleave moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again pierreonlynow realizing the danger to the old count nicholas and prince andrewpromised to do as she wished having briefly and exactly explained herwishes to him she let him go to the drawing roommind the count knows nothing behave as if you know nothing eithershe said and i will go and tell her it is no use expecting him andstay to dinner if you care to she called after pierrepierre met the old count who seemed nervous and upset that morningnatasha had told him that she had rejected bolkonskitroubles troubles my dear fellow he said to pierre what troublesone has with these girls without their mother i do so regret havingcome here i will be frank with you have you heard she has brokenoff her engagement without consulting anybody its true this engagementnever was much to my liking of course he is an excellent man butstill with his fathers disapproval they wouldnt have been happy andnatasha wont lack suitors still it has been going on so long and totake such a step without fathers or mothers consent and now shesill and god knows what its hard count hard to manage daughters intheir mothers absencepierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change thesubject but the count returned to his troublessonya entered the room with an agitated facenatasha is not quite well shes in her room and would like to see youmarya dmitrievna is with her and she too asks you to comeyes you are a great friend of bolkonskis no doubt she wants to sendhim a message said the count oh dear oh dear how happy it allwasand clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left theroomwhen marya dmitrievna told natasha that anatole was married natasha didnot wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by pierrehimself sonya told pierre this as she led him along the corridor tonatashas roomnatasha pale and stern was sitting beside marya dmitrievna and hereyes glittering feverishly met pierre with a questioning look themoment he entered she did not smile or nod but only gazed fixedly athim and her look asked only one thing was he a friend or like theothers an enemy in regard to anatole as for pierre he evidently didnot exist for herhe knows all about it said marya dmitrievna pointing to pierre andaddressing natasha let him tell you whether i have told the truthnatasha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded animallooks at the approaching dogs and sportsmennatalya ilynichna pierre began dropping his eyes with a feeling ofpity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do whether it istrue or not should make no difference to you becausethen it is not true that hes marriedyes it is truehas he been married long she asked on your honorpierre gave his word of honoris he still here she asked quicklyyes i have just seen himshe was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands thatthey should leave her alonepierre did not stay for dinner but left the room and went away at oncehe drove through the town seeking anatole kuragin at the thought ofwhom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a difficulty inbreathing he was not at the ice hills nor at the gypsies nor atkomonenos pierre drove to the club in the club all was going on asusual the members who were assembling for dinner were sitting about ingroups they greeted pierre and spoke of the town news the footmanhaving greeted him knowing his habits and his acquaintances told himthere was a place left for him in the small dining room and that princemichael zakharych was in the library but paul timofeevich had not yetarrived one of pierres acquaintances while they were talking aboutthe weather asked if he had heard of kuragins abduction of rostovawhich was talked of in the town and was it true pierre laughed andsaid it was nonsense for he had just come from the rostovs he askedeveryone about anatole one man told him he had not come yet andanother that he was coming to dinner pierre felt it strange to see thiscalm indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in hissoul he paced through the ballroom waited till everyone had come andas anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove homeanatole for whom pierre was looking dined that day with dolokhovconsulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair it seemed tohim essential to see natasha in the evening he drove to his sisters todiscuss with her how to arrange a meeting when pierre returned homeafter vainly hunting all over moscow his valet informed him that princeanatole was with the countess the countess drawing room was full ofguestspierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his returnat that moment she was more repulsive to him than everentered thedrawing room and seeing anatole went up to himah pierre said the countess going up to her husband you dont knowwhat a plight our anatoleshe stopped seeing in the forward thrust of her husbands head in hisglowing eyes and his resolute gait the terrible indications of thatrage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after hisduel with dolokhovwhere you are there is vice and evil said pierre to his wifeanatole come with me i must speak to you he added in frenchanatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively ready tofollow pierre pierre taking him by the arm pulled him toward himselfand was leading him from the roomif you allow yourself in my drawing room whispered helene butpierre did not reply and went out of the roomanatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayedanxietyhaving entered his study pierre closed the door and addressed anatolewithout looking at himyou promised countess rostova to marry her and were about to elope withher is that somon cher answered anatole their whole conversation was in frenchi dont consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in thattonepierres face already pale became distorted by fury he seized anatoleby the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from sideto side till anatoles face showed a sufficient degree of terrorwhen i tell you that i must talk to you repeated pierrecome now this is stupid what said anatole fingering a button ofhis collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the clothyoure a scoundrel and a blackguard and i dont know what deprives mefrom the pleasure of smashing your head with this said pierreexpressing himself so artificially because he was talking frenchhe took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly but at once putit back in its placedid you promise to marry heri i didnt think of it i never promised becausepierre interrupted himhave you any letters of hers any letters he said moving towardanatoleanatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocketand drew out his pocketbookpierre took the letter anatole handed him and pushing aside a tablethat stood in his way threw himself on the sofai shant be violent dont be afraid said pierre in answer to afrightened gesture of anatoles first the letters said he as ifrepeating a lesson to himself secondly he continued after a shortpause again rising and again pacing the room tomorrow you must getout of moscowbut how can ithirdly pierre continued without listening to him you must neverbreathe a word of what has passed between you and countess rostova iknow i cant prevent your doing so but if you have a spark ofconscience pierre paced the room several times in silenceanatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lipsafter all you must understand that besides your pleasure there is sucha thing as other peoples happiness and peace and that you are ruininga whole life for the sake of amusing yourself amuse yourself with womenlike my wifewith them you are within your rights for they know whatyou want of them they are armed against you by the same experience ofdebauchery but to promise a maid to marry her to deceive tokidnap dont you understand that it is as mean as beating an old manor a childpierre paused and looked at anatole no longer with an angry but with aquestioning looki dont know about that eh said anatole growing more confident aspierre mastered his wrath i dont know that and dont want to hesaid not looking at pierre and with a slight tremor of his lower jawbut you have used such words to memean and so onwhich as a man ofhonor i cant allow anyone to usepierre glanced at him with amazement unable to understand what hewantedthough it was ttette anatole continued still i cantis it satisfaction you want said pierre ironicallyyou could at least take back your words what if you want me to do asyou wish ehi take them back i take them back said pierre and i ask you toforgive me pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button and ifyou require money for your journeyanatole smiled the expression of that base and cringing smile whichpierre knew so well in his wife revolted himoh vile and heartless brood he exclaimed and left the roomnext day anatole left for petersburgpierre drove to marya dmitrievnas to tell her of the fulfillment of herwish that kuragin should be banished from moscow the whole house was ina state of alarm and commotion natasha was very ill having as maryadmitrievna told him in secret poisoned herself the night after she hadbeen told that anatole was married with some arsenic she had stealthilyprocured after swallowing a little she had been so frightened that shewoke sonya and told her what she had done the necessary antidotes hadbeen administered in time and she was now out of danger though still soweak that it was out of the question to move her to the country and sothe countess had been sent for pierre saw the distracted count andsonya who had a tearstained face but he could not see natashapierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip aboutthe attempted abduction of rostova he resolutely denied these rumorsassuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his brotherinlaw had proposed to her and been refused it seemed to pierre that itwas his duty to conceal the whole affair and reestablish natashasreputationhe was awaiting prince andrews return with dread and went every day tothe old princes for news of himold prince bolkonski heard all the rumors current in the town frommademoiselle bourienne and had read the note to princess mary in whichnatasha had broken off her engagement he seemed in better spirits thanusual and awaited his son with great impatiencesome days after anatoles departure pierre received a note from princeandrew informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see himas soon as he reached moscow prince andrew had received from his fathernatashas note to princess mary breaking off her engagementmademoiselle bourienne had purloined it from princess mary and given itto the old prince and he heard from him the story of natashaselopement with additionsprince andrew had arrived in the evening and pierre came to see him nextmorning pierre expected to find prince andrew in almost the same stateas natasha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room tohear him in the study talking in a loud animated voice about someintrigue going on in petersburg the old princes voice and another nowand then interrupted him princess mary came out to meet pierre shesighed looking toward the door of the room where prince andrew wasevidently intending to express her sympathy with his sorrow but pierresaw by her face that she was glad both at what had happened and at theway her brother had taken the news of natashas faithlessnesshe says he expected it she remarked i know his pride will not lethim express his feelings but still he has taken it better far betterthan i expected evidently it had to bebut is it possible that all is really ended asked pierreprincess mary looked at him with astonishment she did not understandhow he could ask such a question pierre went into the study princeandrew greatly changed and plainly in better health but with a freshhorizontal wrinkle between his brows stood in civilian dress facing hisfather and prince meshcherski warmly disputing and vigorouslygesticulating the conversation was about speranskithe news of whosesudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached moscownow he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him amonth ago prince andrew was saying and by those who were unable tounderstand his aims to judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw onhim all the blame of other mens mistakes is very easy but i maintainthat if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done byhim by him alonehe paused at the sight of pierre his face quivered and immediatelyassumed a vindictive expressionposterity will do him justice he concluded and at once turned topierrewell how are you still getting stouter he said with animation butthe new wrinkle on his forehead deepened yes i am well he said inanswer to pierres question and smiledto pierre that smile said plainly i am well but my health is now ofno use to anyoneafter a few words to pierre about the awful roads from the polishfrontier about people he had met in switzerland who knew pierre andabout m dessalles whom he had brought from abroad to be his sonstutor prince andrew again joined warmly in the conversation aboutsperanski which was still going on between the two old menif there were treason or proofs of secret relations with napoleonthey would have been made public he said with warmth and haste i donot and never did like speranski personally but i like justicepierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only toofamiliar to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous mattersin order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimatewhen prince meshcherski had left prince andrew took pierres arm andasked him into the room that had been assigned him a bed had been madeup there and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about princeandrew went to one and took out a small casket from which he drew apacket wrapped in paper he did it all silently and very quickly hestood up and coughed his face was gloomy and his lips compressedforgive me for troubling youpierre saw that prince andrew was going to speak of natasha and hisbroad face expressed pity and sympathy this expression irritated princeandrew and in a determined ringing and unpleasant tone he continuedi have received a refusal from countess rostova and have heard reportsof your brotherinlaw having sought her hand or something of thatkind is that trueboth true and untrue pierre began but prince andrew interrupted himhere are her letters and her portrait said hehe took the packet from the table and handed it to pierregive

timeshe could not marry for he was married already said pierreprince andrew laughed disagreeably again reminding one of his fatherand where is your brotherinlaw now if i may ask he saidhe has gone to peters but i dont know said pierrewell it doesnt matter said prince andrew tell countess rostovathat she was and is perfectly free and that i wish her all that isgoodpierre took the packet prince

pierreaboutyes returned prince andrew hastily i said that a fallen womanshould be forgiven but i didnt say i could forgive her i cantbut can this be compared said pierreprince andrew interrupted him and cried sharply yes ask her handagain be magnanimous and so on yes that would be very noble buti am unable to follow in that gentlemans footsteps if you wish to bemy friend never speak to me of that of all that well goodby soyoull give her the packetpierre left the room and went to the old prince and princess marythe old man seemed livelier than usual princess mary was the same asalways but beneath her sympathy for her brother pierre noticed hersatisfaction that the engagement had been broken off looking at thempierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for therostovs and that it was impossible in their presence even to mentionthe name of her who could give up prince andrew for anyone elseat dinner the talk turned on the war the approach of which was becomingevident prince andrew talked incessantly arguing now with his fathernow with the swiss tutor dessalles and showing an unnatural animationthe cause of which pierre so well understoodthat same evening pierre

thought she would give him her hand as usualbut she stepping up to him stopped breathing heavily her armshanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she wentto the middle of the

when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom restrainingtears of tenderness and joy that choked him and without finding thesleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleighwhere to now your excellency asked the coachmanwhere to pierre asked himself where can i go now surely not to theclub or to pay calls all men seemed so pitiful so poor in comparisonwith this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced in comparisonwith that softened grateful last look she had given him through hertearshome said pierre and despite twentytwo degrees of frost fahrenheithe threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and inhaled theair with joyit was clear and frosty above the dirty illlit streets above theblack roofs stretched the dark starry sky only looking up at the skydid pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundanethings compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raisedat the entrance to the arbat square an immense expanse of dark starrysky presented itself to his eyes almost in the center of it above theprechistenka boulevard surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by starsbut distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth its whitelight and its long uplifted tail shone the enormous and brilliantcomet of the comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes andthe end of the world in pierre however that comet with its longluminous tail aroused no feeling of fear on the contrary he gazedjoyfully his eyes moist with tears at this bright comet which havingtraveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurablespace seemed suddenlylike an arrow piercing the earthto remainfixed in a chosen spot vigorously holding its tail erect shining anddisplaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars itseemed to pierre that this comet fully responded to what was passing inhis own softened and uplifted soul now blossoming into a new lifefrom the close of the year  intensified arming and concentrating ofthe forces of western europe began and in  these forcesmillionsof men reckoning those transporting and feeding the armymoved fromthe west eastwards to the russian frontier toward which since russian forces had been similarly drawn on the twelfth of june the forces of western europe crossed the russian frontier and war beganthat is an event took place opposed to human reason and to humannature millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerablecrimes frauds treacheries thefts forgeries issues of false moneyburglaries incendiarisms and murders as in whole centuries are notrecorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world but whichthose who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimeswhat produced this extraordinary occurrence what were its causes thehistorians tell us with naive assurance that its causes were the wrongsinflicted on the duke of oldenburg the nonobservance of the continentalsystem the ambition of napoleon the firmness of alexander themistakes of the diplomatists and so onconsequently it would only have been necessary for metternichrumyantsev or talleyrand between a levee and an evening party to havetaken proper pains and written a more adroit note or for napoleon tohave written to alexander my respected brother i consent to restorethe duchy to the duke of oldenburgand there would have been no warwe can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries itnaturally seemed to napoleon that the war was caused by englandsintrigues as in fact he said on the island of st helena it naturallyseemed to members of the english parliament that the cause of the warwas napoleons ambition to the duke of oldenburg that the cause of thewar was the violence done to him to businessmen that the cause of thewar was the continental system which was ruining europe to the generalsand old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity ofgiving them employment to the legitimists of that day that it was theneed of reestablishing les bons principes and to the diplomatists ofthat time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance betweenrussia and austria in  had not been sufficiently well concealed fromnapoleon and from the awkward wording of memorandum no  it isnatural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of otherreasons the number depending on the endless diversity of points ofview presented themselves to the men of that day but to us toposterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude andperceive its plain and terrible meaning these causes seem insufficientto us it is incomprehensible that millions of christian men killed andtortured each other either because napoleon was ambitious or alexanderwas firm or because englands policy was astute or the duke ofoldenburg wronged we cannot grasp what connection such circumstanceshave with the actual fact of slaughter and violence why because theduke was wronged thousands of men from the other side of europe killedand ruined the people of smolensk and moscow and were killed by themto us their descendants who are not historians and are not carriedaway by the process of research and can therefore regard the event withunclouded common sense an incalculable number of causes presentthemselves the deeper we delve in search of these causes the more ofthem we find and each separate cause or whole series of causes appearsto us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificancecompared to the magnitude of the events and by its impotenceapartfrom the cooperation of all the other coincident causesto occasion theevent to us the wish or objection of this or that french corporal toserve a second term appears as much a cause as napoleons refusal towithdraw his troops beyond the vistula and to restore the duchy ofoldenburg for had he not wished to serve and had a second a thirdand a thousandth corporal and private also refused there would havebeen so many less men in napoleons army and the war could not haveoccurredhad napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdrawbeyond the vistula and not ordered his troops to advance there wouldhave been no war but had all his sergeants objected to serving a secondterm then also there could have been no war nor could there have been awar had there been no english intrigues and no duke of oldenburg andhad alexander not felt insulted and had there not been an autocraticgovernment in russia or a revolution in france and a subsequentdictatorship and empire or all the things that produced the frenchrevolution and so on without each of these causes nothing could havehappened so all these causesmyriads of causescoincided to bring itabout and so there was no one cause for that occurrence but it had tooccur because it had to millions of men renouncing their humanfeelings and reason had to go from west to east to slay their fellowsjust as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the eastto the west slaying their fellowsthe actions of napoleon and alexander on whose words the event seemedto hang were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who wasdrawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription this could not beotherwise for in order that the will of napoleon and alexander on whomthe event seemed to depend should be carried out the concurrence ofinnumerable circumstances was needed without any one of which the eventcould not have taken place it was necessary that millions of men inwhose hands lay the real powerthe soldiers who fired or transportedprovisions and gunsshould consent to carry out the will of these weakindividuals and should have been induced to do so by an infinite numberof diverse and complex causeswe are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of irrationalevents that is to say events the reasonableness of which we do notunderstand the more we try to explain such events in historyreasonably the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become touseach man lives for himself using his freedom to attain his personalaims and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain fromdoing this or that action but as soon as he has done it that actionperformed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs tohistory in which it has not a free but a predestined significancethere are two sides to the life of every man his individual life whichis the more free the more abstract its interests and his elemental hivelife in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for himman lives consciously for himself but is an unconscious instrument inthe attainment of the historic universal aims of humanity a deed doneis irrevocable and its result coinciding in time with the actions ofmillions of other men assumes an historic significance the higher a manstands on the social ladder the more people he is connected with andthe more power he has over others the more evident is thepredestination and inevitability of his every actionthe kings heart is in the hands of the lorda king is historys slavehistory that is the unconscious general hive life of mankind usesevery moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposesthough napoleon at that time in  was more convinced than ever thatit depended on him verser ou ne pas verser le sang de ses peuples as alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote himhe had neverbeen so much in the grip of inevitable laws which compelled him whilethinking that he was acting on his own volition to perform for the hivelifethat is to say for historywhatever had to be performed to shed or not to shed the blood of his peoplesthe people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men and bythe law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and coordinated to produce that movement and war reproaches for thenonobservance of the continental system the duke of oldenburgs wrongsthe movement of troops into prussiaundertaken as it seemed tonapoleon only for the purpose of securing an armed peace the frenchemperors love and habit of war coinciding with his peoplesinclinations allurement by the grandeur of the preparations and theexpenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining advantagesto compensate for that expenditure the intoxicating honors he receivedin dresden the diplomatic negotiations which in the opinion ofcontemporaries were carried on with a sincere desire to attain peacebut which only wounded the selflove of both sides and millions ofother causes that adapted themselves to the event that was happening orcoincided with itwhen an apple has ripened and falls why does it fall because of itsattraction to the earth because its stalk withers because it is driedby the sun because it grows heavier because the wind shakes it orbecause the boy standing below wants to eat itnothing is the cause all this is only the coincidence of conditions inwhich all vital organic and elemental events occur and the botanist whofinds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and soforth is equally right with the child who stands under the tree and saysthe apple fell because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it equallyright or wrong is he who says that napoleon went to moscow because hewanted to and perished because alexander desired his destruction andhe who says that an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell becausethe last navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock in historicevents the socalled great men are labels giving names to events andlike labels they have but the smallest connection with the event itselfevery act of theirs which appears to them an act of their own will isin an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course ofhistory and predestined from eternityon the twentyninth of may napoleon left dresden where he had spentthree weeks surrounded by a court that included princes dukes kingsand even an emperor before leaving napoleon showed favor to theemperor kings and princes who had deserved it reprimanded the kingsand princes with whom he was dissatisfied presented pearls and diamondsof his ownthat is which he had taken from other kingsto the empressof austria and having as his historian tells us tenderly embraced theempress marie louisewho regarded him as her husband though he hadleft another wife in parisleft her grieved by the parting which sheseemed hardly able to bear though the diplomatists still firmlybelieved in the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that endand though the emperor napoleon himself wrote a letter to alexandercalling him monsieur mon frere and sincerely assured him that he didnot want war and would always love and honor himyet he set off to joinhis army and at every station gave fresh orders to accelerate themovement of his troops from west to east he went in a traveling coachwith six horses surrounded by pages aidesdecamp and an escortalong the road to posen thorn danzig and konigsberg at each of thesetowns thousands of people met him with excitement and enthusiasmthe army was moving from west to east and relays of six horses carriedhim in the same direction on the tenth of june  coming up with thearmy he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on the estate ofa polish count in the vilkavisski forest old stylenext day overtaking the army he went in a carriage to the niemen andchanging into a polish uniform he drove to the riverbank in order toselect a place for the crossingseeing on the other side some cossacks les cosaques and the widespreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of moscowmoscou la ville sainte the capital of a realm such as the scythiainto which alexander the great had marchednapoleon unexpectedly andcontrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations ordered anadvance and the next day his army began to cross the niemenearly in the morning of the twelfth of june he came out of his tentwhich was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the niemen andlooked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out ofthe vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown acrossthe river the troops knowing of the emperors presence were on thelookout for him and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoatand a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent onthe hill they threw up their caps and shouted vive lempereur andone after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the vast forestthat had concealed them and separating flowed on and on by the threebridges to the other sidenow well go into action oh when he takes it in hand himself thingsget hot by heaven there he is vive lempereur so

faces of all was one common expression of joy at thecommencement of the longexpected campaign and of rapture and devotionto the man in the gray coat who was standing on the hillon the thirteenth of june a rather small thoroughbred arab horse wasbrought to napoleon he mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of thebridges over the niemen deafened continually by incessant and rapturousacclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossibleto forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shoutingbut the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him anddistracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from thetime he joined the army he rode across one of the swaying pontoonbridges to the farther side turned sharply to the left and galloped inthe direction of kovno preceded by enraptured mounted chasseurs of theguard who breathless with delight galloped ahead to clear a path forhim through the troops on reaching the broad river viliya he stoppednear a regiment of polish uhlans stationed by the rivervivat shouted the poles ecstatically breaking their ranks andpressing against one another to see himnapoleon looked up and down the river dismounted and sat down on a logthat lay on the bank at a mute sign from him a telescope was handedhim which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run up to himand he gazed at the opposite bank then he became absorbed in a map laidout on the logs without lifting his head he said something and two ofhis aidesdecamp galloped off to the polish uhlanswhat what did he say was heard in the ranks of the polish uhlanswhen one of the aidesdecamp rode up to themthe order was to find a ford and to cross the river the colonel of thepolish uhlans a handsome old man flushed and fumbling in his speechfrom excitement asked the aidedecamp whether he would be permitted toswim the river with his uhlans instead of seeking a ford in evidentfear of refusal like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse hebegged to be allowed to swim across the river before the emperors eyesthe aidedecamp replied that probably the emperor would not bedispleased at this excess of zealas soon as the aidedecamp had said this the old mustached officerwith happy face and sparkling eyes raised his saber shouted vivatand commanding the uhlans to follow him spurred his horse and gallopedinto the river he gave an angry thrust to his horse which had grownrestive under him and plunged into the water heading for the deepestpart where the current was swift hundreds of uhlans galloped in afterhim it was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of thestream and the uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off theirhorses some of the horses were drowned and some of the men the otherstried to swim on some in the saddle and some clinging to their horsesmanes they tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank andthough there was a ford one third of a mile away were proud that theywere swimming and drowning in this river under the eyes of the man whosat on the log and was not even looking at what they were doing whenthe aidedecamp having returned and choosing an opportune momentventured to draw the emperors attention to the devotion of the poles tohis person the little man in the gray overcoat got up and havingsummoned berthier began pacing up and down the bank with him givinghim instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at thedrowning uhlans who distracted his attentionfor him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of theworld from africa to the steppes of muscovy alike was enough todumfound people and impel them to insane selfoblivion he called forhis horse and rode to his quarterssome forty uhlans were drowned in the river though boats were sent totheir assistance the majority struggled back to the bank from whichthey had started the colonel and some of his men got across and withdifficulty clambered out on the further bank and as soon as they hadgot out in their soaked and streaming clothes they shouted vivatand looked ecstatically at the spot where napoleon had been but where heno longer was and at that moment considered themselves happythat evening between issuing one order that the forged russian papermoney prepared for use in russia should be delivered as quickly aspossible and another that a saxon should be shot on whom a lettercontaining information about the orders to the french army had beenfound napoleon also gave instructions that the polish colonel who hadneedlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled in the legiondhonneur of which napoleon was himself the headquos vult perdere dementat  those whom god wishes to destroy he drives madthe emperor of russia had meanwhile been in vilna for more than amonth reviewing troops and holding maneuvers nothing was ready for thewar that everyone expected and to prepare for which the emperor had comefrom petersburg there was no general plan of action the vacillationbetween the various plans that were proposed had even increased afterthe emperor had been at headquarters for a month each of the threearmies had its own commanderinchief but there was no supremecommander of all the forces and the emperor did not assume thatresponsibility himselfthe longer the emperor remained in vilna the less did everybodytiredof waitingprepare for the war all the efforts of those who surroundedthe sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his timepleasantly and forget that war was impendingin june after many balls and fetes given by the polish magnates by thecourtiers and by the emperor himself it occurred to one of the polishaidesdecamp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given forthe emperor by his aidesdecamp this idea was eagerly received theemperor gave his consent the aidesdecamp collected money bysubscription the lady who was thought to be most pleasing to theemperor was invited to act as hostess count bennigsen being alandowner in the vilna province offered his country house for the feteand the thirteenth of june was fixed for a ball dinner regatta andfireworks at zakret count bennigsens country seatthe very day that napoleon issued the order to cross the niemen and hisvanguard driving off the cossacks crossed the russian frontieralexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by his aidesdecamp at bennigsens country houseit was a gay and brilliant fete connoisseurs of such matters declaredthat rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one placecountess bezukhova was present among other russian ladies who hadfollowed the sovereign from petersburg to vilna and eclipsed the refinedpolish ladies by her massive socalled russian type of beauty theemperor noticed her and honored her with a danceboris drubetskoy having left his wife in moscow and being for thepresent en garcon as he phrased it was also there and though not anaidedecamp had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses boris wasnow a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer soughtpatronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of hisown age he was meeting helene in vilna after not having seen her for along time and did not recall the past but as helene was enjoying thefavors of a very important personage and boris had only recentlymarried they met as good friends of long standingat midnight dancing was still going on helene not having a suitablepartner herself offered to dance the mazurka with boris they were thethird couple boris coolly looking at helenes dazzling bare shoulderswhich emerged from a dark goldembroidered gauze gown talked to herof old acquaintances and at the same time unaware of it himself andunnoticed by others never for an instant ceased to observe the emperorwho was in the same room the emperor was not dancing he stood in thedoorway stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words whichhe alone knew how to utteras the mazurka began boris saw that adjutant general balashev one ofthose in closest attendance on the emperor went up to him and contraryto court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to a polish ladyhaving finished speaking to her the emperor looked inquiringly atbalashev and evidently understanding that he only acted thus becausethere were important reasons for so doing nodded slightly to the ladyand turned to him hardly had balashev begun to speak before a look ofamazement appeared on the emperors face he took balashev by the armand crossed the room with him unconsciously clearing a path seven yardswide as the people on both sides made way for him boris noticedarakcheevs excited face when the sovereign went out with balashevarakcheev looked at the emperor from under his brow and sniffing withhis red nose stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the emperorto address him boris understood that arakcheev envied balashev and wasdispleased that evidently important news had reached the emperorotherwise than through himselfbut the emperor and balashev passed out into the illuminated gardenwithout noticing arakcheev who holding his sword and glancingwrathfully around followed some twenty paces behind themall the time boris was going through the figures of the mazurka he wasworried by the question of what news balashev had brought and how hecould find it out before others in the figure in which he had to choosetwo ladies he whispered to helene that he meant to choose countesspotocka who he thought had gone out onto the veranda and glided overthe parquet to the door opening into the garden where seeing balashevand the emperor returning to the veranda he stood still they weremoving toward the door boris fluttering as if he had not had time towithdraw respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed headthe emperor with the agitation of one who has been personallyaffronted was finishing with these wordsto enter russia without declaring war i will not make peace as long asa single armed enemy remains in my country it seemed to boris that itgave the emperor pleasure to utter these words he was satisfied withthe form in which he had expressed his thoughts but displeased thatboris had overheard itlet no one know of it the emperor added with a frownboris understood that this was meant for him and closing his eyesslightly bowed his head the emperor reentered the ballroom andremained there about another halfhourboris was thus the first to learn the news that the french army hadcrossed the niemen and thanks to this was able to show certainimportant personages that much that was concealed from others wasusually known to him and by this means he rose higher in theirestimationthe unexpected news of the french having crossed the niemen wasparticularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations and ata ball on first receiving the news under the influence of indignationand resentment the emperor had found a phrase that pleased him fullyexpressed his feelings and has since become famous on returning homeat two oclock that night he sent for his secretary shishkov and toldhim to write an order to the troops and a rescript to field marshalprince saltykov in which he insisted on the words being inserted thathe would not make peace so long as a single armed frenchman remained onrussian soilnext day the following letter was sent to napoleonmonsieur mon frereyesterday i learned that despite the loyalty with which i have kept myengagements with your majesty your troops have crossed the russianfrontier and i have this moment received from petersburg a note inwhich count lauriston informs me as a reason for this aggression thatyour majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with mefrom the time prince kuragin asked for his passports the reasons onwhich the duc de bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him wouldnever have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext foraggression in fact the ambassador as he himself has declared wasnever authorized to make that demand and as soon as i was informed ofit i let him know how much i disapproved of it and ordered him to remainat his post if your majesty does not intend to shed the blood of ourpeoples for such a misunderstanding and consents to withdraw yourtroops from russian territory i will regard what has passed as nothaving occurred and an understanding between us will be possible in thecontrary case your majesty i shall see myself forced to repel anattack that nothing on my part has provoked it still depends on yourmajesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war i ametcsigned alexanderat two in the morning of the fourteenth of june the emperor havingsent for balashev and read him his letter to napoleon ordered him totake it and hand it personally to the french emperor when dispatchingbalashev the emperor repeated to him the words that he would not makepeace so long as a single armed enemy remained on russian soil and toldhim to transmit those words to napoleon alexander did not insert themin his letter to napoleon because with his characteristic tact he feltit would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt atreconciliation was being made but he definitely instructed balashev torepeat them personally to napoleonhaving set off in the small hours of the fourteenth accompanied by abugler and two cossacks balashev reached the french outposts at thevillage of rykonty on the russian side of the niemen by dawn there hewas stopped by french cavalry sentinelsa french noncommissioned officer of hussars in crimson uniform and ashaggy cap shouted to the approaching balashev to halt balashev didnot do so at once but continued to advance along the road at a walkingpacethe noncommissioned officer frowned and muttering words of abuseadvanced his horses chest against balashev put his hand to his saberand shouted rudely at the russian general asking was he deaf that hedid not do as he was told balashev mentioned who he was thenoncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimentalmatters without looking at the russian generalafter living at the seat of the highest authority and power afterconversing with the emperor less than three hours before and in generalbeing accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service balashevfound it very strange here on russian soil to encounter this hostileand still more this disrespectful application of brute force

french fashion this manrode toward balashev at a gallop his plumes flowing and his gems andgold lace glittering in the bright june sunshinebalashev was only two horses length from the equestrian with thebracelets plumes necklaces and gold embroidery who was gallopingtoward him with a theatrically solemn countenance when julner thefrench colonel whispered respectfully the king of naples it was infact murat now called king of naples though it was quiteincomprehensible why he should be king of naples he was called so andwas himself convinced that he was so and therefore assumed a moresolemn and important air than formerly he was so sure that he reallywas the king of naples that when on the eve of his departure from thatcity while walking through the streets with his wife some italianscalled out to him viva il re  he turned to his wife with a pensivesmile and said poor fellows they dont know that i am leaving themtomorrow long live the kingbut though he firmly believed

but royaute oblige  and he felt it incumbent on himas a king and an ally to confer on state affairs with alexandersenvoy he dismounted took balashevs arm and moving a few steps awayfrom his suite which waited respectfully began to pace up and downwith him trying to speak significantly he referred to the fact thatthe emperor napoleon had resented the demand that he should withdraw histroops from prussia especially when that demand became generally knownand the dignity of france was thereby offended royalty has its obligationsbalashev replied that there was nothing offensive in the demandbecause but murat interrupted himthen you dont consider the emperor alexander the aggressor he askedunexpectedly with a kindly and foolish smilebalashev told him why he considered napoleon to be the originator of thewaroh my dear general murat again interrupted him with all my heart iwish the emperors may arrange the affair between them and that the warbegun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as possible said he inthe tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with anotherdespite a quarrel between their mastersand he went on to inquiries about the grand duke and the state of hishealth and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spentwith him in naples then suddenly as if remembering his royal dignitymurat solemnly drew himself up assumed the pose in which he had stoodat his coronation and waving his right arm saidi wont detain you longer general i wish success to your missionand with his embroidered red mantle his flowing feathers and hisglittering ornaments he rejoined his suite who were respectfullyawaiting himbalashev rode on supposing from murats words that he would very soonbe brought before napoleon himself but instead of that at the nextvillage the sentinels of davouts infantry corps detained him as thepickets of the vanguard had done and an adjutant of the corpscommander who was fetched conducted him into the village to marshaldavoutdavout was to napoleon what arakcheev was to alexanderthough not acoward like arakcheev he was as precise as cruel and as unable toexpress his devotion to his monarch except by crueltyin the organism of states such men are necessary as wolves arenecessary in the organism of nature and they always exist alwaysappear and hold their own however incongruous their presence and theirproximity to the head of the government may be this inevitability alonecan explain how the cruel arakcheev who tore out a grenadiers mustachewith his own hands whose weak nerves rendered him unable to facedanger and who was neither an educated man nor a courtier was able tomaintain his powerful position with alexander whose own character waschivalrous noble and gentlebalashev found davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a peasants hutwritinghe was auditing accounts better quarters could have been foundhim but marshal davout was one of those men who purposely putthemselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification forbeing gloomy for the same reason they are always hard at work and in ahurry how can i think of the bright side of life when as you see iam sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed the expression ofhis face seemed to say the chief pleasure and necessity of such menwhen they encounter anyone who shows animation is to flaunt their owndreary persistent activity davout allowed himself that pleasure whenbalashev was brought in he became still more absorbed in his task whenthe russian general entered and after glancing over his spectacles atbalashevs face which was animated by the beauty of the morning and byhis talk with murat he did not rise or even stir but scowled stillmore and sneered malevolentlywhen he noticed in balashevs face the disagreeable impression thisreception produced davout raised his head and coldly asked what hewantedthinking he could have been received in such a manner only becausedavout did not know that he was adjutant general to the emperoralexander and even his envoy to napoleon balashev hastened to informhim of his rank and mission contrary to his expectation davout afterhearing him became still surlier and ruderwhere is your dispatch he inquired give it to me i will send it tothe emperorbalashev replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to theemperoryour emperors orders are obeyed in your army but here said davoutyou must do as youre toldand as if to make the russian general still more conscious of hisdependence on brute force davout sent an adjutant to call the officeron dutybalashev took out the packet containing the emperors letter and laid iton the table made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it laidacross two barrels davout took the packet and read the inscriptionyou are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or notprotested balashev but permit me to observe that i have the honor tobe adjutant general to his majestydavout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from thesigns of agitation and confusion which appeared on balashevs faceyou will be treated as is fitting said he and putting the packet inhis pocket left the sheda minute later the marshals adjutant de castres came in and conductedbalashev to the quarters assigned himthat day he dined with the marshal at the same board on the barrelsnext day davout rode out early and after asking balashev to come tohim peremptorily requested him to remain there to move on with thebaggage train should orders come for it to move and to talk to no oneexcept monsieur de castresafter four days of solitude ennui and consciousness of his impotenceand insignificanceparticularly acute by contrast with the sphere ofpower in which he had so lately movedand after several marches withthe marshals baggage and the french army which occupied the wholedistrict balashev was brought to vilnanow occupied by the frenchthrough the very gate by which he had left it four days previouslynext day the imperial gentlemaninwaiting the comte de turenne cameto balashev and informed him of the emperor napoleons wish to honor himwith an audiencefour days before sentinels of the preobrazhensk regiment had stood infront of the house to which balashev was conducted and now two frenchgrenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and withshaggy caps on their heads and an escort of hussars and uhlans and abrilliant suite of aidesdecamp pages and generals who were waitingfor napoleon to come out were standing at the porch round his saddlehorse and his mameluke rustan napoleon received balashev in the veryhouse in vilna from which alexander had dispatched him on his missionthough balashev was used to imperial pomp he was amazed at the luxuryand magnificence of napoleons courtthe comte de turenne showed him into a big reception room where manygenerals gentlemeninwaiting and polish magnatesseveral of whombalashev had seen at the court of the emperor of russiawere waitingduroc said that napoleon would receive the russian general before goingfor his rideafter some minutes the gentlemaninwaiting who was on duty came intothe great reception room and bowing politely asked balashev to followhimbalashev went into a small reception room one door of which led into astudy the very one from which the russian emperor had dispatched him onhis mission he stood a minute or two waiting he heard hurriedfootsteps beyond the door both halves of it were opened rapidly allwas silent and then from the study the sound was heard of other stepsfirm and resolutethey were those of napoleon he had just finisheddressing for his ride and wore a blue uniform opening in front over awhite waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach whiteleather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs andhessian boots his short hair had evidently just been brushed but onelock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead his plump white neckstood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform and he smelledof eau de cologne his full face rather younglooking with itsprominent chin wore a gracious and majestic expression of imperialwelcomehe entered briskly with a jerk at every step and his head slightlythrown back his whole short corpulent figure with broad thickshoulders and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding had thatimposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live incomfort it was evident too that he was in the best of spirits thatdayhe nodded in answer to balashavs low and respectful bow and coming upto him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of histime and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but is surehe will always say the right thing and say it wellgood day general said he i have received the letter you broughtfrom the emperor alexander and am very glad to see you he glanced withhis large eyes into balashavs face and immediately looked past himit was plain that balashevs personality did not interest him at allevidently only what took place within his own mind interested himnothing outside himself had any significance for him because everythingin the world it seemed to him depended entirely on his willi do not and did not desire war he continued but it has beenforced on me even now he emphasized the word i am ready to receiveany explanations you can give meand he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons fordissatisfaction with the russian government judging by the calmlymoderate and amicable tone in which the french emperor spoke balashevwas firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter intonegotiationswhen napoleon having finished speaking looked inquiringly at therussian envoy balashev began a speech he had prepared long beforesire the emperor my master but the sight of the emperors eyesbent on him confused him you are flurriedcompose yourself napoleonseemed to say as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked atbalashevs uniform and swordbalashev recovered himself and began to speak he said that the emperoralexander did not consider kurakins demand for his passports asufficient cause for war that kurakin had acted on his own initiativeand without his sovereigns assent that the emperor alexander did notdesire war and had no relations with englandnot yet interposed napoleon and as if fearing to give vent to hisfeelings he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that balashev mightproceedafter saying all he had been instructed to say balashev added that theemperor alexander wished for peace but would not enter intonegotiations except on condition that here balashev hesitated heremembered the words the emperor alexander had not written in hisletter but had specially inserted in the rescript to saltykov and hadtold balashev to repeat to napoleon balashev remembered these wordsso long as a single armed foe remains on russian soil but somecomplex feeling restrained him he could not utter them though hewished to do so he grew confused and said on condition that thefrench army retires beyond the niemennapoleon noticed balashevs embarrassment when uttering these lastwords his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiverrhythmically without moving from where he stood he began speaking in alouder tone and more hurriedly than before during the speech thatfollowed balashev who more than once lowered his eyes involuntarilynoticed the quivering of napoleons left leg which increased the morenapoleon raised his voicei desire peace no less than the emperor alexander he began have inot for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it i havewaited eighteen months for explanations but in order to beginnegotiations what is demanded of me he said frowning and making anenergetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump handthe withdrawal of your army beyond the niemen sire replied balashevthe niemen repeated napoleon so now you want me to retire beyondthe niemenonly the niemen repeated napoleon looking straight atbalashevthe latter bowed his head respectfullyinstead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from pomeraniaonly a withdrawal beyond the niemen was now demanded napoleon turnedquickly and began to pace the roomyou say the demand now is that i am to withdraw beyond the niemenbefore commencing negotiations but in just the same way two months agothe demand was that i should withdraw beyond the vistula and the oderand yet you are willing to negotiatehe went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and againstopped in front of balashev balashev noticed that his left leg wasquivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its sternexpression this quivering of his left leg was a thing napoleon wasconscious of the vibration of my left calf is a great sign with mehe remarked at a later datesuch demands as to retreat beyond the vistula and oder may be made to aprince of baden but not to me napoleon almost screamed quite to hisown surprise if you gave me petersburg and moscow i could not acceptsuch conditions you say i have begun this war but who first joined hisarmy the emperor alexander not i and you offer me negotiations when ihave expended millions when you are in alliance with england and whenyour position is a bad one you offer me negotiations but what is theaim of your alliance with england what has she given you he continuedhurriedly evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peaceand discuss its possibility but only to prove his own rectitude andpower and alexanders errors and duplicitythe commencement of his speech had obviously been made with theintention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showingthat he was nevertheless willing to negotiate but he had begun talkingand the more he talked the less could he control his wordsthe whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself andinsult alexanderjust what he had least desired at the commencement ofthe interviewi hear you have made peace with turkeybalashev bowed his head affirmativelypeace has been concluded he beganbut napoleon did not let him speak he evidently wanted to do all thetalking himself and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence andunrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so proneyes i know you have made peace with the turks without obtainingmoldavia and wallachia i would have given your sovereign thoseprovinces as i gave him finland yes he went on i promised and wouldhave given the emperor alexander moldavia and wallachia and now hewont have those splendid provinces yet he might have united them tohis empire and in a single reign would have extended russia from thegulf of bothnia to the mouths of the danube catherine the great couldnot have done more said napoleon growing more and more excited as hepaced up and down the room repeating to balashev almost the very wordshe had used to alexander himself at tilsit all that he would haveowed to my friendship oh what a splendid reign he repeated severaltimes then paused drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox lifted it tohis nose and greedily sniffed at itwhat a splendid reign the emperor alexanders might have beenhe looked compassionately at balashev and as soon as the latter triedto make some rejoinder hastily interrupted himwhat could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained throughmy friendship demanded napoleon shrugging his shoulders inperplexity but no he has preferred to surround himself with myenemies and with whom with steins armfeldts bennigsens andwintzingerodes stein a traitor expelled from his own countryarmfeldt a rake and an intriguer wintzingerode a fugitive frenchsubject bennigsen rather more of a soldier than the others but allthe same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in  and whoshould awaken terrible memories in the emperor alexanders mindgranted that were they competent they might be made use of continuednapoleonhardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughtsthat incessantly sprang up proving how right and strong he was in hisperception the two were one and the samebut they are not even thatthey are neither fit for war nor peace barclay is said to be the mostcapable of them all but i cannot say so judging by his firstmovements and what are they doing all these courtiers pfuel proposesarmfeldt disputes bennigsen considers and barclay called on to actdoes not know what to decide on and time passes bringing no resultbagration alone is a military man hes stupid but he has experience aquick eye and resolution and what role is your young monarchplaying in that monstrous crowd they compromise him and throw on himthe responsibility for all that happens a sovereign should not be withthe army unless he is a general said napoleon evidently utteringthese words as a direct challenge to the emperor he knew how alexanderdesired to be a military commanderthe campaign began only a week ago and you havent even been able todefend vilna you are cut in two and have been driven out of the polishprovinces your army is grumblingon the contrary your majesty said balashev hardly able to rememberwhat had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks withdifficulty the troops are burning with eagernessi know everything napoleon interrupted him i know everything iknow the number of your battalions as exactly as i know my own you havenot two hundred thousand men and i have three times that number i giveyou my word of honor said napoleon forgetting that his word of honorcould carry no weighti give you my word of honor that i have fivehundred and thirty thousand men this side of the vistula the turks willbe of no use to you they are worth nothing and have shown it by makingpeace with you as for the swedesit is their fate to be governed bymad kings their king was insane and they changed him for anotherbernadotte who promptly went madfor no swede would ally himself withrussia unless he were madnapoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nosebalashev knew how to reply to each of napoleons remarks and would havedone so he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to saysomething but napoleon always interrupted him to the alleged insanityof the swedes balashev wished to reply that when russia is on her sidesweden is practically an island but napoleon gave an angry exclamationto drown his voice napoleon was in that state of irritability in whicha man has to talk talk and talk merely to convince himself that he isin the right balashev began to feel uncomfortable as envoy he fearedto demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying but as a manhe shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidentlyseized napoleon he knew that none of the words now uttered by napoleonhad any significance and that napoleon himself would be ashamed of themwhen he came to his senses balashev stood with downcast eyes lookingat the movements of napoleons stout legs and trying to avoid meetinghis eyesbut what do i care about your allies said napoleon i have alliesthe poles there are eighty thousand of them and they fight like lionsand there will be two hundred thousand of themand probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered thisobvious falsehood and that balashev still stood silently before him inthe same attitude of submission to fate napoleon abruptly turned rounddrew close to balashevs face and gesticulating rapidly andenergetically with his white hands almost shoutedknow that if you stir up prussia against me ill wipe it off the mapof europe he declared his face pale and distorted by anger and hestruck one of his small hands energetically with the other yes i willthrow you back beyond the dvina and beyond the dnieper and will reerect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of europeto allow to be destroyed yes that is what will happen to you that iswhat you have gained by alienating me and he walked silently severaltimes up and down the room his fat shoulders twitchinghe put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket took it out again liftedit several times to his nose and stopped in front of balashev hepaused looked ironically straight into balashevs eyes and said in aquiet voiceand yet what a splendid reign your master might have hadbalashev feeling it incumbent on him to reply said that from therussian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light napoleon wassilent still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening tohim balashev said that in russia the best results were expected fromthe war napoleon nodded condescendingly as if to say i know itsyour duty to say that but you dont believe it yourself i haveconvinced youwhen balashev had ended napoleon again took out his snuffbox sniffedat it and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal the dooropened a gentlemaninwaiting bending respectfully handed the emperorhis hat and gloves another brought him a pocket handkerchief napoleonwithout giving them a glance turned to balashevassure the emperor alexander from me said he taking his hat that iam as devoted to him as before i know him thoroughly and very highlyesteem his lofty qualities i will detain you no longer general youshall receive my letter to the emperorand napoleon went quickly to the door everyone in the reception roomrushed forward and descended the staircaseafter all that napoleon had said to himthose bursts of anger and thelast dryly spoken words i will detain you no longer general youshall receive my letter balashev felt convinced that napoleon wouldnot wish to see him and would even avoid another meeting with himaninsulted envoyespecially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger butto his surprise balashev received through duroc an invitation to dinewith the emperor that daybessieres caulaincourt and berthier were present at that dinnernapoleon met balashev cheerfully and amiably he not only showed no signof constraint or selfreproach on account of his outburst that morningbut on the contrary tried to reassure balashev it was evident that hehad long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make amistake and that in his perception whatever he did was right notbecause it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong but because hedid itthe emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through vilna wherecrowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him from all thewindows of the streets through which he rode rugs flags and hismonogram were displayed and the polish ladies welcoming him wavedtheir handkerchiefs to himat dinner having placed balashev beside him napoleon not only treatedhim amiably but behaved as if balashev were one of his own courtiersone of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at hissuccess in the course of conversation he mentioned moscow andquestioned balashev about the russian capital not merely as aninterested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit but as ifconvinced that balashev as a russian must be flattered by hiscuriosityhow many inhabitants are there in moscow how many houses is it truethat moscow is called holy moscow how many churches are there inmoscow he askedand receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churcheshe remarkedwhy such a quantity of churchesthe russians are very devout replied balashevbut a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of thebackwardness of a people said napoleon turning to caulaincourt forappreciation of this remarkbalashev respectfully ventured to disagree with the french emperorevery country has its own character said hebut nowhere in europe is there anything like that said napoleoni beg your majestys pardon returned balashev besides russia thereis spain where there are also many churches and monasteriesthis reply of balashevs which hinted at the recent defeats of thefrench in spain was much appreciated when he related it at alexanderscourt but it was not much appreciated at napoleons dinner where itpassed unnoticedthe uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that theywere puzzled as to what balashevs tone suggested if there is a pointwe dont see it or it is not at all witty their expressions seemed tosay so little was his rejoinder appreciated that napoleon did notnotice it at all and naively asked balashev through what towns thedirect road from there to moscow passed balashev who was on the alertall through the dinner replied that just as all roads lead to romeso all roads lead to moscow there were many roads and among them theroad through poltava which charles xii chose balashev involuntarilyflushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply but hardly had heuttered the word poltava before caulaincourt began speaking of thebadness of the road from petersburg to moscow and of his petersburgreminiscencesafter dinner they went to drink coffee in napoleons study which fourdays previously had been that of the emperor alexander napoleon satdown toying with his sevres coffee cup and motioned balashev to achair beside himnapoleon was in that wellknown afterdinner mood which more than anyreasoned cause makes a man contented with himself and disposed toconsider everyone his friend it seemed to him that he was surrounded bymen who adored him and he felt convinced that after his dinnerbalashev too was his friend and worshiper napoleon turned to him with apleasant though slightly ironic smilethey tell me this is the room the emperor alexander occupied strangeisnt it general he said evidently not doubting that this remarkwould be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his napoleonssuperiority to alexanderbalashev made no reply and bowed his head in silenceyes four days ago in this room wintzingerode and stein weredeliberating continued napoleon with the same derisive and selfconfident smile what i cant understand he went on is that theemperor alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies thati do not understand has he not thought that i may do the same andhe turned inquiringly to balashev and evidently this thought turned himback on to the track of his mornings anger which was still fresh inhimand let him know that i will do so said napoleon rising and pushinghis cup away with his hand ill drive all his wurttemberg baden andweimar relations out of germany yes ill drive them out let himprepare an asylum for them in russiabalashev bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like tomake his bow and leave and only listened because he could not helphearing what was said to him napoleon did not notice this expressionhe treated balashev not as an envoy from his enemy but as a man nowfully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former mastershumiliationand why has the emperor alexander taken command of the armies what isthe good of that war is my profession but his business is to reign andnot to command armies why has he taken on himself such aresponsibilityagain napoleon brought out his snuffbox paced several times up and downthe room in silence and then suddenly and unexpectedly went up tobalashev and with a slight smile as confidently quickly and simply asif he were doing something not merely important but pleasing tobalashev he raised his hand to the fortyyearold russian generalsface and taking him by the ear pulled it gently smiling with his lipsonlyto have ones ear pulled by the emperor was considered the greatesthonor and mark of favor at the french courtwell adorer and courtier of the emperor alexander why dont you sayanything said he as if it was ridiculous in his presence to be theadorer and courtier of anyone but himself napoleon are the horsesready for the general he added with a slight inclination of his headin reply to balashevs bow let him have mine he has a long way togothe letter taken by balashev was the last napoleon sent to alexanderevery detail of the interview was communicated to the russian monarchand the war beganafter his interview with pierre in moscow prince andrew went topetersburg on business as he told his family but really to meetanatole kuragin whom he felt it necessary to encounter on reachingpetersburg he inquired for kuragin but the latter had already left thecity pierre had warned his brotherinlaw that prince andrew was on histrack anatole kuragin promptly obtained an appointment from theminister of war and went to join the army in moldavia while inpetersburg prince andrew met kutuzov his former commander who wasalways well disposed toward him and kutuzov suggested that he shouldaccompany him to the army in moldavia to which the old general had beenappointed commanderinchief so prince andrew having received anappointment on the headquarters staff left for turkeyprince andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge kuragin hethought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it mightcompromise the young countess rostova and so he wanted to meet kuraginpersonally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel but he againfailed to meet kuragin in turkey for soon after prince andrew arrivedthe latter returned to russia in a new country amid new conditionsprince andrew found life easier to bear after his betrothed had brokenfaith with himwhich he felt the more acutely the more he tried toconceal its effectsthe surroundings in which he had been happy becametrying to him and the freedom and independence he had once prized sohighly were still more so not only could he no longer think thethoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on thefield of austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with pierre and whichhad filled his solitude at bogucharovo and then in switzerland and romebut he even dreaded to recall them and the bright and boundless horizonsthey had revealed he was now concerned only with the nearest practicalmatters unrelated to his past interests and he seized on these the moreeagerly the more those past interests were closed to him it was as ifthat lofty infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above himhad suddenly turned into a low solid vault that weighed him down inwhich all was clear but nothing eternal or mysteriousof the activities that presented themselves to him army service was thesimplest and most familiar as a general on duty on kutuzovs staff heapplied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprisedkutuzov by his willingness and accuracy in work not having foundkuragin in turkey prince andrew did not think it necessary to rush backto russia after him but all the same he knew that however long it mightbe before he met kuragin despite his contempt for him and despite allthe proofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stoopingto a conflict with himhe knew that when he did meet him he would notbe able to resist calling him out any more than a ravenous man can helpsnatching at food and the consciousness that the insult was not yetavenged that his rancor was still unspent weighed on his heart andpoisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain inturkey by means of restless plodding and rather vainglorious andambitious activityin the year  when news of the war with napoleon reached bucharestwhere kutuzov had been living for two months passing his days andnights with a wallachian womanprince andrew asked kutuzov to transferhim to the western army kutuzov who was already weary of bolkonskisactivity which seemed to reproach his own idleness very readily let himgo and gave him a mission to barclay de tollybefore joining the western army which was then in may encamped atdrissa prince andrew visited bald hills which was directly on his waybeing only two miles off the smolensk highroad during the last threeyears there had been so many changes in his life he had thought feltand seen so much having traveled both in the east and the west thaton reaching bald hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to findthe way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail heentered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up theavenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchantedsleeping castle the same old stateliness the same cleanliness thesame stillness reigned there and inside there was the same furniturethe same walls sounds and smell and the same timid faces onlysomewhat older princess mary was still the same timid plain maidengetting on in years uselessly and joylessly passing the best years ofher life in fear and constant suffering mademoiselle bourienne was thesame coquettish selfsatisfied girl enjoying every moment of herexistence and full of joyous hopes for the future she had merely becomemore selfconfident prince andrew thought dessalles the tutor he hadbrought from switzerland was wearing a coat of russian cut and talkingbroken russian to the servants but was still the same narrowlyintelligent conscientious and pedantic preceptor the old prince hadchanged in appearance only by the loss of a tooth which left anoticeable gap on one side of his mouth in character he was the same asever only showing still more irritability and skepticism as to what washappening in the world little nicholas alone had changed he had grownbecome rosier had curly dark hair and when merry and laughing quiteunconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just asthe little princess used to do he alone did not obey the law ofimmutability in the enchanted sleeping castle but though externallyall remained as of old the inner relations of all these people hadchanged since prince andrew had seen them last the household wasdivided into two alien and hostile camps who changed their habits forhis sake and only met because he was there to the one camp belonged theold prince mademoiselle bourienne and the architect to the otherprincess mary dessalles little nicholas and all the old nurses andmaidsduring his stay at bald hills all the family dined together but theywere ill at ease and prince andrew felt that he was a visitor for whosesake an exception was being made and that his presence made them allfeel awkward involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day hewas taciturn and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumband retired to his apartments directly after dinner in the eveningwhen prince andrew went to him and trying to rouse him began to tellhim of the young count kamenskys campaign the old prince beganunexpectedly to talk about princess mary blaming her for hersuperstitions and her dislike of mademoiselle bourienne who he saidwas the only person really attached to himthe old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of princessmary that she purposely worried and irritated him and that byindulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little prince nicholas theold prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that herlife was very hard but he also knew that he could not help tormentingher and that she deserved it why does prince andrew who sees thissay nothing to me about his sister does he think me a scoundrel or anold fool who without any reason keeps his own daughter at a distanceand attaches this frenchwoman to himself he doesnt understand so imust explain it and he must hear me out thought the old prince andhe began explaining why he could not put up with his daughtersunreasonable characterif you ask me said prince andrew without looking up he wascensuring his father for the first time in his life i did not wish tospeak about it but as you ask me i will give you my frank opinion ifthere is any misunderstanding and discord between you and mary i cantblame her for it at all i know how she loves and respects you sinceyou ask me continued prince andrew becoming irritableas he wasalways liable to do of latei can only say that if there are anymisunderstandings they are caused by that worthless woman who is notfit to be my sisters companionthe old man at first stared fixedly at his son and an unnatural smiledisclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which prince andrew couldnot get accustomedwhat companion my dear boy eh youve already been talking it overehfather i did not want to judge said prince andrew in a hard andbitter tone but you challenged me and i have said and always shallsay that mary is not to blame but those to blamethe one to blameisthat frenchwomanah he has passed judgment passed judgement said the old man in alow voice and as it seemed to prince andrew with some embarrassmentbut then he suddenly jumped up and cried be off be off let not atrace of you remain hereprince andrew wished to leave at once but princess mary persuaded himto stay another day that day he did not see his father who did notleave his room and admitted no one but mademoiselle bourienne andtikhon but asked several times whether his son had gone next daybefore leaving prince andrew went to his sons rooms the boy curlyheaded like his mother and glowing with health sat on his knee andprince andrew began telling him the story of bluebeard but fell into areverie without finishing the story he thought not of this prettychild his son whom he held on his knee but of himself he sought inhimself either remorse for having angered his father or regret atleaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms with him andwas horrified to find neither what meant still more to him was that hesought and did not find in himself the former tenderness for his sonwhich he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him onhis kneewell go on said his sonprince andrew without replying put him down from his knee and went outof the roomas soon as prince andrew had given up his daily occupations andespecially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he hadbeen happy weariness of life overcame him with its former intensityand he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work assoon as possibleso youve decided to go andrew asked his sisterthank god that i can replied prince andrew i am very sorry youcantwhy do you say that replied princess mary why do you say that whenyou are going to this terrible war and he is so old mademoisellebourienne says he has been asking about youas soon as she began to speak of that her lips trembled and her tearsbegan to fall prince andrew turned away and began pacing the roomah my god my god when one thinks who and whatwhat trashcan causepeople misery he said with a malignity that alarmed princess maryshe understood that when speaking of trash he referred not only tomademoiselle bourienne the cause of her misery but also to the man whohad ruined his own happinessandrew one thing i beg i entreat of you she said touching hiselbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears iunderstand you she looked down dont imagine that sorrow is thework of men men are his tools she looked a little above princeandrews head with the confident accustomed look with which one looksat the place where a familiar portrait hangs sorrow is sent by himnot by men men are his instruments they are not to blame if you thinksomeone has wronged you forget it and forgive we have no right topunish and then you will know the happiness of forgivingif i were a woman i would do so mary that is a womans virtue but aman should not and cannot forgive and forget he replied and thoughtill that moment he had not been thinking of kuragin all his unexpendedanger suddenly swelled up in his heartif mary is already persuading me to forgive it means that i ought longago to have punished him he thought and giving her no further replyhe began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he would meetkuragin who he knew was now in the armyprincess mary begged him to stay one day more saying that she knew howunhappy her father would be if andrew left without being reconciled tohim but prince andrew replied that he would probably soon be back againfrom the army and would certainly write to his father but that thelonger he stayed now the more embittered their differences would becomegoodbye andrew remember that misfortunes come from god and men arenever to blame were the last words he heard from his sister when hetook leave of herthen it must be so thought prince andrew as he drove out of theavenue from the house at bald hills she poor innocent creature isleft to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits the oldman feels he is guilty but cannot change himself my boy is growing upand rejoices in life in which like everybody else he will deceive or bedeceived and i am off to the army why i myself dont know i want tomeet that man whom i despise so as to give him a chance to kill andlaugh at methese conditions of life had been the same before but then they wereall connected while now they had all tumbled to pieces only senselessthings lacking coherence presented themselves one after another toprince andrews mindprince andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the end ofjune the first army with which was the emperor occupied the fortifiedcamp at drissa the second army was retreating trying to effect ajunction with the first one from which it was said to be cut off bylarge french forces everyone was dissatisfied with the general courseof affairs in the russian army but no one anticipated any danger ofinvasion of the russian provinces and no one thought the war wouldextend farther than the western the polish provincesprince andrew found barclay de tolly to whom he had been assigned onthe bank of the drissa as there was not a single town or large villagein the vicinity of the camp the immense number of generals andcourtiers accompanying the army were living in the best houses of thevillages on both sides of the river over a radius of six miles barclayde tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the emperor he receivedbolkonski stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign accent that hewould mention him to the emperor for a decision as to his employmentbut asked him meanwhile to remain on his staff anatole kuragin whomprince andrew had hoped to find with the army was not there he hadgone to petersburg but prince andrew was glad to hear this his mindwas occupied by the interests of the center that was conducting agigantic war and he was glad to be free for a while from thedistraction caused by the thought of kuragin during the first fourdays while no duties were required of him prince andrew rode round thewhole fortified camp and by the aid of his own knowledge and by talkswith experts tried to form a definite opinion about it but thequestion whether the camp was advantageous or disadvantageous remainedfor him undecided already from his military experience and what he hadseen in the austrian campaign he had come to the conclusion that in warthe most deeply considered plans have no significance and that alldepends on the way unexpected movements of the enemythat cannot beforeseenare met and on how and by whom the whole matter is handledto clear up this last point for himself prince andrew utilizing hisposition and acquaintances tried to fathom the character of the controlof the army and of the men and parties engaged in it and he deduced forhimself the following of the state of affairswhile the emperor had still been at vilna the forces had been dividedinto three armies first the army under barclay de tolly secondly thearmy under bagration and thirdly the one commanded by tormasov theemperor was with the first army but not as commanderinchief in theorders issued it was stated not that the emperor would take commandbut only that he would be with the army the emperor moreover had withhim not a commanderinchiefs staff but the imperial headquartersstaff in attendance on him was the head of the imperial staffquartermaster general prince volkonski as well as generals imperialaidesdecamp diplomatic officials and a large number of foreignersbut not the army staff besides these there were in attendance on theemperor without any definite appointments arakcheev the exminister ofwar count bennigsen the senior general in rank the grand duketsarevich constantine pavlovich count rumyantsev the chancellorstein a former prussian minister armfeldt a swedish general pfuelthe chief author of the plan of campaign paulucci an adjutant generaland sardinian emigre wolzogenand many others though these men had nomilitary appointment in the army their position gave them influenceand often a corps commander or even the commanderinchief did notknow in what capacity he was questioned by bennigsen the grand dukearakcheev or prince volkonski or was given this or that advice and didnot know whether a certain order received in the form of advice emanatedfrom the man who gave it or from the emperor and whether it had to beexecuted or not but this was only the external condition the essentialsignificance of the presence of the emperor and of all these peoplefrom a courtiers point of view and in an emperors vicinity all becamecourtiers was clear to everyone it was this the emperor did notassume the title of commanderinchief but disposed of all the armiesthe men around him were his assistants arakcheev was a faithfulcustodian to enforce order and acted as the sovereigns bodyguardbennigsen was a landlord in the vilna province who appeared to be doingthe honors of the district but was in reality a good general useful asan adviser and ready at hand to replace barclay the grand duke wasthere because it suited him to be the exminister stein was therebecause his advice was useful and the emperor alexander held him in highesteem personally armfeldt virulently hated napoleon and was a generalfull of selfconfidence a quality that always influenced alexanderpaulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech theadjutants general were there because they always accompanied theemperor and lastly and chiefly pfuel was there because he had drawn upthe plan of campaign against napoleon and having induced alexander tobelieve in the efficacy of that plan was directing the whole businessof the war with pfuel was wolzogen who expressed pfuels thoughts in amore comprehensible way than pfuel himself who was a harsh bookishtheorist selfconfident to the point of despising everyone else wasable to dobesides these russians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpectedideas every dayespecially the foreigners who did so with a boldnesscharacteristic of people employed in a country not their ownthere weremany secondary personages accompanying the army because their principalswere thereamong the opinions and voices in this immense restless brilliant andproud sphere prince andrew noticed the following sharply definedsubdivisions of tendencies and partiesthe first party consisted of pfuel and his adherentsmilitary theoristswho believed in a science of war with immutable lawslaws of obliquemovements outflankings and so forth pfuel and his adherents demandeda retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with preciselaws defined by a pseudotheory of war and they saw only barbarismignorance or evil intention in every deviation from that theory tothis party belonged the foreign nobles wolzogen wintzingerode andothers chiefly germansthe second party was directly opposed to the first one extreme asalways happens was met by representatives of the other the members ofthis party were those who had demanded an advance from vilna into polandand freedom from all prearranged plans besides being advocates of boldaction this section also represented nationalism which made them stillmore onesided in the dispute they were russians bagration ermolovwho was beginning to come to the front and others at that time afamous joke of ermolovs was being circulated that as a great favor hehad petitioned the emperor to make him a german the men of that partyremembering suvorov said that what one had to do was not to reason orstick pins into maps but to fight beat the enemy keep him out ofrussia and not let the army get discouragedto the third partyin which the emperor had most confidencebelongedthe courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other twothe members of this party chiefly civilians and to whom arakcheevbelonged thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish toseem to have some generally say they said that undoubtedly warparticularly against such a genius as bonaparte they called himbonaparte now needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientificknowledge and in that respect pfuel was a genius but at the same timeit had to be acknowledged that the theorists are often onesided andtherefore one should not trust them absolutely but should also listento what pfuels opponents and practical men of experience in warfare hadto say and then choose a middle course they insisted on the retentionof the camp at drissa according to pfuels plan but on changing themovements of the other armies though by this course neither one aimnor the other could be attained yet it seemed best to the adherents ofthis third partyof a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was thetsarevich who could not forget his disillusionment at austerlitz wherehe had ridden out at the head of the guards in his casque and cavalryuniform as to a review expecting to crush the french gallantly butunexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amidthe general confusion the men of this party had both the quality andthe defect of frankness in their opinions they feared napoleonrecognized his strength and their own weakness and frankly said sothey said nothing but sorrow shame and ruin will come of all thiswe have abandoned vilna and vitebsk and shall abandon drissa the onlyreasonable thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possiblebefore we are turned out of petersburgthis view was very general in the upper army circles and found supportalso in petersburg and from the chancellor rumyantsev who for otherreasons of state was in favor of peacethe fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of barclay detolly not so much as a man but as minister of war and commanderinchief be he what he may they always began like that he is anhonest practical man and we have nobody better give him real powerfor war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of command andhe will show what he can do as he did in finland if our army is wellorganized and strong and has withdrawn to drissa without suffering anydefeats we owe this entirely to barclay if barclay is now to besuperseded by bennigsen all will be lost for bennigsen showed hisincapacity already in the sixth party the bennigsenites said on the contrary that at anyrate there was no one more active and experienced than bennigsen andtwist about as you may you will have to come to bennigsen eventuallylet the others make mistakes now said they arguing that ourretirement to drissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken seriesof blunders the more mistakes that are made the better it will at anyrate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like thiswhat is wanted is not some barclay or other but a man like bennigsenwho made his mark in  and to whom napoleon himself did justiceaman whose authority would be willingly recognized and bennigsen is theonly such manthe seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to befound especially around young sovereigns and of whom there wereparticularly many round alexandergenerals and imperial aidesdecamppassionately devoted to the emperor not merely as a monarch but as aman adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly as rostov had done in and who saw in him not only all the virtues but all humancapabilities as well these men though enchanted with the sovereign forrefusing the command of the army yet blamed him for such excessivemodesty and only desired and insisted that their adored sovereignshould abandon his diffidence and openly announce that he would placehimself at the head of the army gather round him a commanderinchiefsstaff and consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men wherenecessary would himself lead the troops whose spirits would thereby beraised to the highest pitchthe eighth and largest group which in its enormous numbers was to theothers as ninetynine to one consisted of men who desired neither peacenor war neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the drissa oranywhere else neither barclay nor the emperor neither pfuel norbennigsen but only the one most essential thingas much advantage andpleasure for themselves as possible in the troubled waters ofconflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the emperorsheadquarters it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable atother times a man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post wouldtoday agree with pfuel tomorrow with his opponent and the day aftermerely to avoid responsibility or to please the emperor would declarethat he had no opinion at all on the matter another who wished to gainsome advantage would attract the emperors attention by loudlyadvocating the very thing the emperor had hinted at the day before andwould dispute and shout at the council beating his breast andchallenging those who did not agree with him to duels thereby provingthat he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good a thirdin the absence of opponents between two councils would simply solicit aspecial gratuity for his faithful services well knowing that at thatmoment people would be too busy to refuse him a fourth while seeminglyoverwhelmed with work would often come accidentally under the emperorseye a fifth to achieve his longcherished aim of dining with theemperor would stubbornly insist on the correctness or falsity of somenewly emerging opinion and for this object would produce arguments moreor less forcible and correctall the men of this party were fishing for rubles decorations andpromotions and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperialfavor and directly they noticed it turning in any direction this wholedrone population of the army began blowing hard that way so that it wasall the harder for the emperor to turn it elsewhere amid theuncertainties of the position with the menace of serious danger givinga peculiarly threatening character to everything amid this vortex ofintrigue egotism conflict of views and feelings and the diversity ofrace among these peoplethis eighth and largest party of thosepreoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion andobscurity to the common task whatever question arose a swarm of thesedrones without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme flewover to the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices ofthose who were disputing honestlyfrom among all these parties just at the time prince andrew reached thearmy another a ninth party was being formed and was beginning toraise its voice this was the party of the elders reasonable menexperienced and capable in state affairs who without sharing any ofthose conflicting opinions were able to take a detached view of whatwas going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means ofescape from this muddle indecision intricacy and weaknessthe men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resultedchiefly from the emperors presence in the army with his military courtand from the consequent presence there of an indefinite conditionaland unsteady fluctuation of relations which is in place at court butharmful in an army that a sovereign should reign but not command thearmy and that the only way out of the position would be for the emperorand his court to leave the army that the mere presence of the emperorparalyzed the action of fifty thousand men required to secure hispersonal safety and that the worst commanderinchief if independentwould be better than the very best one trammeled by the presence andauthority of the monarchjust at the time prince andrew was living unoccupied at drissashishkov the secretary of state and one of the chief representatives ofthis party wrote a letter to the emperor which arakcheev and balashevagreed to sign in this letter availing himself of permission given himby the emperor to discuss the general course of affairs he respectfullysuggestedon the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arousea warlike spirit in the people of the capitalthat the emperor shouldleave the armythat arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to them todefend their countrythe very incitement which was the chief cause ofrussias triumph in so far as it was produced by the tsars personalpresence in moscowwas suggested to the emperor and accepted by himas a pretext for quitting the armythis letter had not yet been presented to the emperor when barclay oneday at dinner informed bolkonski that the sovereign wished to see himpersonally to question him about turkey and that prince andrew was topresent himself at bennigsens quarters at six that eveningnews was received at the emperors quarters that very day of a freshmovement by napoleon which might endanger the armynews subsequentlyfound to be false and that morning colonel michaud had ridden round thedrissa fortifications with the emperor and had pointed out to him thatthis fortified camp constructed by pfuel and till then considered achefdoeuvre of tactical science which would ensure napoleonsdestruction was an absurdity threatening the destruction of therussian armyprince andrew arrived at bennigsens quartersa country gentlemanshouse of moderate size situated on the very banks of the river neitherbennigsen nor the emperor was there but chernyshev the emperors aidedecamp received bolkonski and informed him that the emperoraccompanied by general bennigsen and marquis paulucci had gone a secondtime that day to inspect the fortifications of the drissa camp of thesuitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be feltchernyshev was sitting at a window in the first room with a french novelin his hand this room had probably been a music room there was stillan organ in it on which some rugs were piled and in one corner stoodthe folding bedstead of bennigsens adjutant this adjutant was alsothere and sat dozing on the rolledup bedding evidently exhausted bywork or by feasting two doors led from the room one straight on intowhat had been the drawing room and another on the right to the studythrough the first door came the sound of voices conversing in german andoccasionally in french in that drawing room were gathered by theemperors wish not a military council the emperor preferredindefiniteness but certain persons whose opinions he wished to know inview of the impending difficulties it was not a council of war but asit were a council to elucidate certain questions for the emperorpersonally to this semicouncil had been invited the swedish generalarmfeldt adjutant general wolzogen wintzingerode whom napoleon hadreferred to as a renegade french subject michaud toll count steinwho was not a military man at all and pfuel himself who as princeandrew had heard was the mainspring of the whole affair prince andrewhad an opportunity of getting a good look at him for pfuel arrived soonafter himself and in passing through to the drawing room stopped aminute to speak to chernyshevat first sight pfuel in his illmade uniform of a russian generalwhich fitted him badly like a fancy costume seemed familiar to princeandrew though he saw him now for the first time there was about himsomething of weyrother mack and schmidt and many other germantheoristgenerals whom prince andrew had seen in  but he was moretypical than any of them prince andrew had never yet seen a germantheorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united tosuch an extentpfuel was short and very thin but broadboned of coarse robust buildbroad in the hips and with prominent shoulder blades his face was muchwrinkled and his eyes deep set his hair had evidently been hastilybrushed smooth in front of the temples but stuck up behind in quaintlittle tufts he entered the room looking restlessly and angrilyaround as if afraid of everything in that large apartment awkwardlyholding up his sword he addressed chernyshev and asked in german wherethe emperor was one could see that he wished to pass through the roomsas quickly as possible finish with the bows and greetings and sit downto business in front of a map where he would feel at home he noddedhurriedly in reply to chernyshev and smiled ironically on hearing thatthe sovereign was inspecting the fortifications that he pfuel hadplanned in accord with his theory he muttered something to himselfabruptly and in a bass voice as selfassured germans doit might havebeen stupid fellow or the whole affair will be ruined orsomething absurd will come of it prince andrew did not catch whathe said and would have passed on but chernyshev introduced him topfuel remarking that prince andrew was just back from turkey where thewar had terminated so fortunately pfuel barely glancednot so much atprince andrew as past himand said with a laugh that must have beena fine tactical war and laughing contemptuously went on into theroom from which the sound of voices was heardpfuel always inclined to be irritably sarcastic was particularlydisturbed that day evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspectand criticize his camp in his absence from this short interview withpfuel prince andrew thanks to his austerlitz experiences was able toform a clear conception of the man pfuel was one of those hopelesslyand immutably selfconfident men selfconfident to the point ofmartyrdom as only germans are because only germans are selfconfidenton the basis of an abstract notionscience that is the supposedknowledge of absolute truth a frenchman is selfassured because heregards himself personally both in mind and body as irresistiblyattractive to men and women an englishman is selfassured as being acitizen of the bestorganized state in the world and therefore as anenglishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does asan englishman is undoubtedly correct an italian is selfassured becausehe is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people a russianis selfassured just because he knows nothing and does not want to knowanything since he does not believe that anything can be known thegermans selfassurance is worst of all stronger and more repulsivethan any other because he imagines that he knows the truthsciencewhich he himself has invented but which is for him the absolute truthpfuel was evidently of that sort he had a sciencethe theory ofoblique movements deduced by him from the history of frederick thegreats wars and all he came across in the history of more recentwarfare seemed to him absurd and barbarousmonstrous collisions inwhich so many blunders were committed by both sides that these warscould not be called wars they did not accord with the theory andtherefore could not serve as material for sciencein  pfuel had been one of those responsible for the plan ofcampaign that ended in jena and auerstadt but he did not see the leastproof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war onthe contrary the deviations made from his theory were in his opinionthe sole cause of the whole disaster and with characteristicallygleeful sarcasm he would remark there i said the whole affair wouldgo to the devil pfuel was one of those theoreticians who so love theirtheory that they lose sight of the theorys objectits practicalapplication his love of theory made him hate everything practical andhe would not listen to it he was even pleased by failures for failuresresulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to himthe accuracy of his theoryhe said a few words to prince andrew and chernyshev about the presentwar with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all will go wrongand who is not displeased that it should be so the unbrushed tufts ofhair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his templesexpressed this most eloquentlyhe passed into the next room and the deep querulous sounds of hisvoice were at once heard from thereprince andrews eyes were still following pfuel out of the room whencount bennigsen entered hurriedly and nodding to bolkonski but notpausing went into the study giving instructions to his adjutant as hewent the emperor was following him and bennigsen had hastened on tomake some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereignchernyshev and prince andrew went out into the porch where the emperorwho looked fatigued was dismounting marquis paulucci was talking tohim with particular warmth and the emperor with his head bent to theleft was listening with a dissatisfied air the emperor moved forwardevidently wishing to end the conversation but the flushed and exciteditalian oblivious of decorum followed him and continued to speakand as for the man who advised forming this campthe drissa campsaid paulucci as the emperor mounted the steps and noticing princeandrew scanned his unfamiliar face as to that person sirecontinued paulucci desperately apparently unable to restrain himselfthe man who advised the drissa campi see no alternative but thelunatic asylum or the gallowswithout heeding the end of the italians remarks and as though nothearing them the emperor recognizing bolkonski addressed himgraciouslyi am very glad to see you go in there where they are meeting and waitfor methe emperor went into the study he was followed by prince petermikhaylovich volkonski and baron stein and the door closed behind themprince andrew taking advantage of the emperors permission accompaniedpaulucci whom he had known in turkey into the drawing room where thecouncil was assembledprince peter mikhaylovich volkonski occupied the position as it wereof chief of the emperors staff he came out of the study into thedrawing room with some maps which he spread on a table and putquestions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemenpresent what had happened was that news which afterwards proved to befalse had been received during the night of a movement by the french tooutflank the drissa campthe first to speak was general armfeldt who to meet the difficulty thatpresented itself unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position awayfrom the petersburg and moscow roads the reason for this wasinexplicable unless he wished to show that he too could have anopinion but he urged that at this point the army should unite andthere await the enemy it was plain that armfeldt had thought out thatplan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questionsputwhich in fact his plan did not answeras to avail himself of theopportunity to air it it was one of the millions of proposals one asgood as another that could be made as long as it was quite unknown whatcharacter the war would take some disputed his arguments othersdefended them young count toll objected to the swedish generals viewsmore warmly than anyone else and in the course of the dispute drew fromhis side pocket a wellfilled notebook which he asked permission toread to them in these voluminous notes toll suggested another schemetotally different from armfeldts or pfuels plan of campaign in answerto toll paulucci suggested an advance and an attack which he urgedcould alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trapas he called the drissa camp in which we were situatedduring all these discussions pfuel and his interpreter wolzogen hisbridge in court relations were silent pfuel only snortedcontemptuously and turned away to show that he would never demeanhimself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing so whenprince volkonski who was in the chair called on him to give hisopinion he merely saidwhy ask me general armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with anexposed rear or why not this italian gentlemans attackvery fine ora retreat also good why ask me said he why you yourselves knoweverything better than i dobut when volkonski said with a frown that it was in the emperors namethat he asked his opinion pfuel rose and suddenly growing animatedbegan to speakeverything has been spoiled everything muddled everybody thought theyknew better than i did and now you come to me how mend matters thereis nothing to mend the principles laid down by me must be strictlyadhered to said he drumming on the table with his bony fingers whatis the difficulty nonsense childishnesshe went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that noeventuality could alter the efficiency of the drissa camp thateverything had been foreseen and that if the enemy were really going tooutflank it the enemy would inevitably be destroyedpaulucci who did not know german began questioning him in frenchwolzogen came to the assistance of his chief who spoke french badlyand began translating for him hardly able to keep pace with pfuel whowas rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had happened but allthat could happen had been foreseen in his scheme and that if therewere now any difficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his planhad not been precisely executed he kept laughing sarcastically hedemonstrated and at last contemptuously ceased to demonstrate like amathematician who ceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of aproblem that has already been proved wolzogen took his place andcontinued to explain his views in french every now and then turning topfuel and saying is it not so your excellency but pfuel like a manheated in a fight who strikes those on his own side shouted angrily athis own supporter wolzogenwell of course what more is there to explainpaulucci and michaud both attacked wolzogen simultaneously in frencharmfeldt addressed pfuel in german toll explained to volkonski inrussian prince andrew listened and observed in silenceof all these men prince andrew sympathized most with pfuel angrydetermined and absurdly selfconfident as he was of all those presentevidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself nursed nohatred against anyone and only desired that the plan formed on atheory arrived at by years of toil should be carried out he wasridiculous and unpleasantly sarcastic but yet he inspired involuntaryrespect by his boundless devotion to an idea besides this the remarksof all except pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable atthe council of war in  there was now a panic fear of napoleonsgenius which though concealed was noticeable in every rejoindereverything was assumed to be possible for napoleon they expected himfrom every side and invoked his terrible name to shatter each othersproposals pfuel alone seemed to consider napoleon a barbarian likeeveryone else who opposed his theory but besides this feeling ofrespect pfuel evoked pity in prince andrew from the tone in which thecourtiers addressed him and the way paulucci had allowed himself tospeak of him to the emperor but above all from a certain desperation inpfuels own expressions it was clear that the others knew and pfuelhimself felt that his fall was at hand and despite his selfconfidenceand grumpy german sarcasm he was pitiable with his hair smoothlybrushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind though heconcealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt he wasevidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying histheory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole worldwas slipping away from himthe discussions continued a long time and the longer they lasted themore heated became the disputes culminating in shouts andpersonalities and the less was it possible to arrive at any generalconclusion from all that had been said prince andrew listening to thispolyglot talk and to these surmises plans refutations and shoutsfelt nothing but amazement at what they were saying a thought that hadlong since and often occurred to him during his military activitiestheidea that there is not and cannot be any science of war and thattherefore there can be no such thing as a military geniusnow appearedto him an obvious truth what theory and science is possible about amatter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannotbe defined especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot beascertained no one was or is able to foresee in what condition our orthe enemys armies will be in a days time and no one can gauge theforce of this or that detachment sometimeswhen there is not a cowardat the front to shout we are cut off and start running but a braveand jolly lad who shouts hurraha detachment of five thousand isworth thirty thousand as at schon grabern while at times fiftythousand run from eight thousand as at austerlitz what science canthere be in a matter in which as in all practical matters nothing canbe defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions thesignificance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrivesno one knows when armfeldt says our army is cut in half and pauluccisays we have got the french army between two fires michaud says thatthe worthlessness of the drissa camp lies in having the river behind itand pfuel says that is what constitutes its strength toll proposes oneplan armfeldt another and they are all good and all bad and theadvantages of any suggestions can be seen only at the moment of trialand why do they all speak of a military genius is a man a genius whocan order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to goto the right and who to the left it is only because military men areinvested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter powerattributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess the bestgenerals i have known were on the contrary stupid or absentmindedmen bagration was the best napoleon himself admitted that and ofbonaparte himself i remember his limited selfsatisfied face on thefield of austerlitz not only does a good army commander not need anyspecial qualities on the contrary he needs the absence of the highestand best human attributeslove poetry tenderness and philosophicinquiring doubt he should be limited firmly convinced that what he isdoing is very important otherwise he will not have sufficientpatience and only then will he be a brave leader god forbid that heshould be humane should love or pity or think of what is just andunjust it is understandable that a theory of their genius wasinvented for them long ago because they have power the success of amilitary action depends not on them but on the man in the ranks whoshouts we are lost or who shouts hurrah and only in the rankscan one serve with assurance of being usefulso thought prince andrew as he listened to the talking and he rousedhimself only when paulucci called him and everyone was leavingat the review next day the emperor asked prince andrew where he wouldlike to serve and prince andrew lost his standing in court circlesforever by not asking to remain attached to the sovereigns person butfor permission to serve in the armybefore the beginning of the campaign rostov had received a letter fromhis parents in which they told him briefly of natashas illness and thebreaking off of her engagement to prince andrew which they explained bynatashas having rejected him and again asked nicholas to retire fromthe army and return home on receiving this letter nicholas did noteven make any attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from thearmy but wrote to his parents that he was sorry natasha was ill and herengagement broken off and that he would do all he could to meet theirwishes to sonya he wrote separatelyadored friend of my soul he wrote nothing but honor could keep mefrom returning to the country but now at the commencement of thecampaign i should feel dishonored not only in my comrades eyes but inmy own if i preferred my own happiness to my love and duty to thefatherland but this shall be our last separation believe me directlythe war is over if i am still alive and still loved by you i willthrow up everything and fly to you to press you forever to my ardentbreastit was in fact only the commencement of the campaign that preventedrostov from returning home as he had promised and marrying sonya theautumn in otradnoe with the hunting and the winter with the christmasholidays and sonyas love had opened out to him a vista of tranquilrural joys and peace such as he had never known before and which nowallured him a splendid wife children a good pack of hounds a dozenleashes of smart borzois agriculture neighbors service byelection thought he but now the campaign was beginning and he hadto remain with his regiment and since it had to be so nicholas rostovas was natural to him felt contented with the life he led in theregiment and was able to find pleasure in that lifeon his return from his furlough nicholas having been joyfully welcomedby his comrades was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from theukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him commendationfrom his commanders during his absence he had been promoted captainand when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase innumbers he was again allotted his old squadronthe campaign began the regiment was moved into poland on double paynew officers arrived new men and horses and above all everybody wasinfected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the commencementof a war and rostov conscious of his advantageous position in theregiment devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests ofmilitary service though he knew that sooner or later he would have torelinquish themthe troops retired from vilna for various complicated reasons of statepolitical and strategic each step of the retreat was accompanied by acomplicated interplay of interests arguments and passions atheadquarters for the pavlograd hussars however the whole of thisretreat during the finest period of summer and with sufficient supplieswas a very simple and agreeable businessit was only at headquarters that there was depression uneasiness andintriguing in the body of the army they did not ask themselves wherethey were going or why if they regretted having to retreat it was onlybecause they had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to or somepretty young polish lady if the thought that things looked bad chancedto enter anyones head he tried to be as cheerful as befits a goodsoldier and not to think of the general trend of affairs but only ofthe task nearest to hand first they camped gaily before vilna makingacquaintance with the polish landowners preparing for reviews and beingreviewed by the emperor and other high commanders then came an order toretreat to sventsyani and destroy any provisions they could not carryaway with them sventsyani was remembered by the hussars only as thedrunken camp a name the whole army gave to their encampment there andbecause many complaints were made against the troops who takingadvantage of the order to collect provisions took also horsescarriages and carpets from the polish proprietors rostov rememberedsventsyani because on the first day of their arrival at that small townhe changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunkenmen of his squadron who unknown to him had appropriated five barrelsof old beer from sventsyani they retired farther and farther to drissaand thence again beyond drissa drawing near to the frontier of russiaproperon the thirteenth of july the pavlograds took part in a serious actionfor the first timeon the twelfth of july on the eve of that action there was a heavystorm of rain and hail in general the summer of  was remarkablefor its stormsthe two pavlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye whichwas already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle andhorses the rain was descending in torrents and rostov with a youngofficer named ilyin his protege was sitting in a hastily constructedshelter an officer of their regiment with long mustaches extendingonto his cheeks who after riding to the staff had been overtaken by therain entered rostovs shelteri have come from the staff count have you heard of raevskisexploitand the officer gave them details of the saltanov battle which he hadheard at the staffrostov smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the watertrickled down his neck listened inattentively with an occasionalglance at ilyin who was pressing close to him this officer a lad ofsixteen who had recently joined the regiment was now in the samerelation to nicholas that nicholas had been to denisov seven yearsbefore ilyin tried to imitate rostov in everything and adored him as agirl might have donezdrzhinski the officer with the long mustache spoke grandiloquently ofthe saltanov dam being a russian thermopylae and of how a deed worthyof antiquity had been performed by general raevski he recounted howraevski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and hadcharged with them beside him rostov heard the story and not only saidnothing to encourage zdrzhinskis enthusiasm but on the contrarylooked like a man ashamed of what he was hearing though with nointention of contradicting it since the campaigns of austerlitz and of rostov knew by experience that men always lie when describingmilitary exploits as he himself had done when recounting them besidesthat he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war atall as we can imagine or relate it and so he did not like zdrzhinskistale nor did he like zdrzhinski himself who with his mustachesextending over his cheeks bent low over the face of his hearer as washis habit and crowded rostov in the narrow shanty rostov looked at himin silence in the first place there must have been such a confusionand crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if raevski did leadhis sons there it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozenmen nearest to him thought he the rest could not have seen how orwith whom raevski came onto the dam and even those who did see it wouldnot have been much stimulated by it for what had they to do withraevskis tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in dangerand besides the fate of the fatherland did not depend on whether theytook the saltanov dam or not as we are told was the case atthermopylae so why should he have made such a sacrifice and why exposehis own children in the battle i would not have taken my brother petyathere or even ilyin whos a stranger to me but a nice lad but wouldhave tried to put them somewhere under cover nicholas continued tothink as he listened to zdrzhinski but he did not express histhoughts for in such matters too he had gained experience he knewthat this tale redounded to the glory of our arms and so one had topretend not to doubt it and he acted accordinglyi cant stand this any more said ilyin noticing that rostov did notrelish zdrzhinskis conversation my stockings and shirt and thewater is running on my seat ill go and look for shelter the rainseems less heavyilyin went out and zdrzhinski rode awayfive minutes later ilyin splashing through the mud came running backto the shantyhurrah rostov come quick ive found it about two hundred yards awaytheres a tavern where ours have already gathered we can at least getdry there and mary hendrikhovnas theremary hendrikhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor a pretty younggerman woman he had married in poland the doctor whether from lack ofmeans or because he did not like to part from his young wife in theearly days of their marriage took her about with him wherever thehussar regiment went and his jealousy had become a standing joke amongthe hussar officersrostov threw his cloak over his shoulders shouted to lavrushka tofollow with the things andnow slipping in the mud now splashingright through itset off with ilyin in the lessening rain and thedarkness that was occasionally rent by distant lightningrostov where are youhere what lightning they called to one anotherin the tavern before which stood the doctors covered cart there werealready some five officers mary hendrikhovna a plump little blondegerman in a dressing jacket and nightcap was sitting on a broad benchin the front corner her husband the doctor lay asleep behind herrostov and ilyin on entering the room were welcomed with merry shoutsand laughterdear me how jolly we are said rostov laughingand why do you stand there gapingwhat swells they are why the water streams from them dont make ourdrawing room so wetdont mess mary hendrikhovnas dress cried other voicesrostov and ilyin hastened to find a corner where they could change intodry clothes without offending mary hendrikhovnas modesty they weregoing into a tiny recess behind a partition to change but found itcompletely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the lightof a solitary candle on an empty box and these officers would on noaccount yield their position mary hendrikhovna obliged them with theloan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain and behind that screenrostov and ilyin helped by lavrushka who had brought their kitschanged their wet things for dry onesa fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove a board was foundfixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth a small samovar wasproduced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum and having asked maryhendrikhovna to preside they all crowded round her one offered her aclean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands another spread a jacketunder her little feet to keep them from the damp another hung his coatover the window to keep out the draft and yet another waved the fliesoff her husbands face lest he should wake upleave him alone said mary hendrikhovna smiling timidly and happilyhe is sleeping well as it is after a sleepless nightoh no mary hendrikhovna replied the officer one must look afterthe doctor perhaps hell take pity on me someday when it comes tocutting off a leg or an arm for methere were only three tumblers the water was so muddy that one couldnot make out whether the tea was strong or weak and the samovar heldonly six tumblers of water but this made it all the pleasanter to taketurns in order of seniority to receive ones tumbler from maryhendrikhovnas plump little hands with their short and not overcleannails all the officers appeared to be and really were in love withher that evening even those playing cards behind the partition soonleft their game and came over to the samovar yielding to the generalmood of courting mary hendrikhovna she seeing herself surrounded bysuch brilliant and polite young men beamed with satisfaction try asshe might to hide it and perturbed as she evidently was each time herhusband moved in his sleep behind herthere was only one spoon sugar was more plentiful than anything elsebut it took too long to dissolve so it was decided that maryhendrikhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn rostov receivedhis tumbler and adding some rum to it asked mary hendrikhovna to stiritbut you take it without sugar she said smiling all the time as ifeverything she said and everything the others said was very amusing andhad a double meaningit is not the sugar i want but only that your little hand should stirmy teamary hendrikhovna assented and began looking for the spoon which someonemeanwhile had pounced onuse your finger mary hendrikhovna it will be still nicer saidrostovtoo hot she replied blushing with pleasureilyin put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it tomary hendrikhovna asking her to stir it with her fingerthis is my cup said he only dip your finger in it and ill drink itall upwhen they had emptied the samovar rostov took a pack of cards andproposed that they should play kings with mary hendrikhovna they drewlots to settle who should make up her set at rostovs suggestion it wasagreed that whoever became king should have the right to kiss maryhendrikhovnas hand and that the booby should go to refill and reheatthe samovar for the doctor when the latter awokewell but supposing mary hendrikhovna is king asked ilyinas it is she is queen and her word is lawthey had hardly begun to play before the doctors disheveled headsuddenly appeared from behind mary hendrikhovna he had been awake forsome time listening to what was being said and evidently found nothingentertaining or amusing in what was going on his face was sad anddepressed without greeting the officers he scratched himself and askedto be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way as soon as he hadleft the room all the officers burst into loud laughter and maryhendrikhovna blushed till her eyes filled with tears and thereby becamestill more attractive to them returning from the yard the doctor toldhis wife who had ceased to smile so happily and looked at him inalarm awaiting her sentence that the rain had ceased and they must goto sleep in their covered cart or everything in it would be stolenbut ill send an orderly two of them said rostov what an ideadoctorill stand guard on it myself said ilyinno gentlemen you have had your sleep but i have not slept for twonights replied the doctor and he sat down morosely beside his wifewaiting for the game to endseeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife the officers grewstill merrier and some of them could not refrain from laughter forwhich they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts when he had gone takinghis wife with him and had settled down with her in their covered cartthe officers lay down in the tavern covering themselves with their wetcloaks but they did not sleep for a long time now they exchangedremarks recalling the doctors uneasiness and his wifes delight nowthey ran out into the porch and reported what was taking place in thecovered trap several times rostov covering his head tried to go tosleep but some remark would arouse him and conversation would beresumed to the accompaniment of unreasoning merry childlike laughterit was nearly three oclock but no one was yet asleep when thequartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town ofostrovna still laughing and talking the officers began hurriedlygetting ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar butrostov went off to his squadron without waiting for tea day wasbreaking the rain had ceased and the clouds were dispersing it feltdamp and cold especially in clothes that were still moist as they leftthe tavern in the twilight of the dawn rostov and ilyin both glancedunder the wet and glistening leather hood of the doctors cart fromunder the apron of which his feet were sticking out and in the middleof which his wifes nightcap was visible and her sleepy breathingaudibleshe really is a dear little thing said rostov to ilyin who wasfollowing hima charming woman said ilyin with all the gravity of a boy ofsixteenhalf an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road the commandwas heard to mount and the soldiers crossed themselves and mountedrostov riding in front gave the order forward and the hussars withclanking sabers and subdued talk their horses hoofs splashing in themud defiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birchtrees on each side following the infantry and a battery that had goneon in fronttattered bluepurple clouds reddening in the east were scuddingbefore the wind it was growing lighter and lighter that curly grasswhich always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible stillwet with the nights rain the drooping branches of the birches alsowet swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to oneside the soldiers faces were more and more clearly visible rostovalways closely followed by ilyin rode along the side of the roadbetween two rows of birch treeswhen campaigning rostov allowed himself the indulgence of riding not aregimental but a cossack horse a judge of horses and a sportsman hehad lately procured himself a large fine mettlesome donets horseduncolored with light mane and tail and when he rode it no one couldoutgallop him to ride this horse was a pleasure to him and he thoughtof the horse of the morning of the doctors wife but not once of theimpending dangerformerly when going into action rostov had felt afraid now he had notthe least feeling of fear he was fearless not because he had grownused to being under fire one cannot grow used to danger but becausehe had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger he had grownaccustomed when going into action to think about anything but what wouldseem most likely to interest himthe impending danger during the firstperiod of his service hard as he tried and much as he reproachedhimself with cowardice he had not been able to do this but with timeit had come of itself now he rode beside ilyin under the birch treesoccasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand sometimestouching his horses side with his foot or without turning roundhanding a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding behind him with ascalm and careless an air as though he were merely out for a ride heglanced with pity at the excited face of ilyin who talked much and ingreat agitation he knew from experience the tormenting expectation ofterror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time couldhelp himas soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the cloudsthe wind fell as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morningafter the storm drops still continued to fall but vertically now andall was still the whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappearedbehind a long narrow cloud that hung above it a few minutes later itreappeared brighter still from behind the top of the cloud tearing itsedge everything grew bright and glittered and with that light and asif in reply to it came the sound of guns ahead of thembefore rostov had had time to consider and determine the distance ofthat firing count ostermanntolstoys adjutant came galloping fromvitebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the roadthe squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the batterywhich hadalso quickened their pacerode down a hill and passing through anempty and deserted village again ascended the horses began to latherand the men to flushhalt dress your ranks the order of the regimental commander washeard ahead forward by the left walk march came the order from infrontand the hussars passing along the line of troops on the left flank ofour position halted behind our uhlans who were in the front line tothe right stood our infantry in a dense column they were the reservehigher up the hill on the very horizon our guns were visible throughthe wonderfully clear air brightly illuminated by slanting morningsunbeams in front beyond a hollow dale could be seen the enemyscolumns and guns our advanced line already in action could be heardbriskly exchanging shots with the enemy in the daleat these sounds long unheard rostovs spirits rose as at the strainsof the merriest music traptatatap cracked the shots now togethernow several quickly one after another again all was silent and thenagain it sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and explodingthemthe hussars remained in the same place for about an hour a cannonadebegan count ostermann with his suite rode up behind the squadronhalted spoke to the commander of the regiment and rode up the hill tothe gunsafter ostermann had gone a command rang out to the uhlansform column prepare to chargethe infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow the cavalryto pass the uhlans started the streamers on their spears flutteringand trotted downhill toward the french cavalry which was seen below tothe leftas soon as the uhlans descended the hill the hussars were ordered upthe hill to support the battery as they took the places vacated by theuhlans bullets came from the front whining and whistling but fellspent without taking effectthe sounds which he had not heard for so long had an even morepleasurable and exhilarating effect on rostov than the previous soundsof firing drawing himself up he viewed the field of battle opening outbefore him from the hill and with his whole soul followed the movementof the uhlans they swooped down close to the french dragoons somethingconfused happened there amid the smoke and five minutes later ouruhlans were galloping back not to the place they had occupied but moreto the left and among the orangecolored uhlans on chestnut horses andbehind them in a large group blue french dragoons on gray horses couldbe seenrostov with his keen sportsmans eye was one of the first to catchsight of these blue french dragoons pursuing our uhlans nearer andnearer in disorderly crowds came the uhlans and the french dragoonspursuing them he could already see how these men who looked so smallat the foot of the hill jostled and overtook one another waving theirarms and their sabers in the airrostov gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt he feltinstinctively that if the hussars struck at the french dragoons now thelatter could not withstand them but if a charge was to be made it mustbe done now at that very moment or it would be too late he lookedaround a captain standing beside him was gazing like himself witheyes fixed on the cavalry below themandrew sevastyanych said rostov you know we could crush thema fine thing too replied the captain and reallyrostov without waiting to hear him out touched his horse galloped tothe front of his squadron and before he had time to finish giving theword of command the whole squadron sharing his feeling was followinghim rostov himself did not know how or why he did it he acted as hedid when hunting without reflecting or considering he saw the dragoonsnear and that they were galloping in disorder he knew they could notwithstand an attackknew there was only that moment and that if he letit slip it would not return the bullets were whining and whistling sostimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he couldnot restrain himself he touched his horse gave the word of commandand immediately hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of hisdeployed squadron rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoonshardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their paceinstinctively changed to a gallop which grew faster and faster as theydrew nearer to our uhlans and the french dragoons who galloped afterthem the dragoons were now close at hand on seeing the hussars theforemost began to turn while those behind began to halt with the samefeeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf rostovgave rein to his donets horse and galloped to intersect the path of thedragoons disordered lines one uhlan stopped another who was on footflung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over and a riderlesshorse fell in among the hussars nearly all the french dragoons weregalloping back rostov picking out one on a gray horse dashed afterhim on the way he came upon a bush his gallant horse cleared it andalmost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he wouldimmediately overtake the enemy he had selected that frenchman by hisuniform an officer was going at a gallop crouching on his gray horseand urging it on with his saber in another moment rostovs horse dashedits breast against the hindquarters of the officers horse almostknocking it over and at the same instant rostov without knowing whyraised his saber and struck the frenchman with itthe instant he had done this all rostovs animation vanished theofficer fell not so much from the blowwhich had but slightly cut hisarm above the elbowas from the shock to his horse and from frightrostov reined in his horse and his eyes sought his foe to see whom hehad vanquished the french dragoon officer was hopping with one foot onthe ground the other being caught in the stirrup his eyes screwed upwith fear as if he every moment expected another blow gazed up atrostov with shrinking terror his pale and mudstained facefair andyoung with a dimple in the chin and lightblue eyeswas not an enemysface at all suited to a battlefield but a most ordinary homelike facebefore rostov had decided what to do with him the officer cried isurrender he hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of thestirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from rostovs facesome hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into thesaddle on all sides the hussars were busy with the dragoons one waswounded but though his face was bleeding he would not give up hishorse another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round hima third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse in front thefrench infantry were firing as they ran the hussars galloped hastilyback with their prisoners rostov galloped back with the rest aware ofan unpleasant feeling of depression in his heart something vague andconfused which he could not at all account for had come over him withthe capture of that officer and the blow he had dealt himcount ostermanntolstoy met the returning hussars sent for rostovthanked him and said he would report his gallant deed to the emperorand would recommend him for a st georges cross when sent for by countostermann rostov remembering that he had charged without orders feltsure his commander was sending for him to punish him for breach ofdiscipline ostermanns flattering words and promise of a reward shouldtherefore have struck him all the more pleasantly but he still feltthat same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea but what onearth is worrying me he asked himself as he rode back from thegeneral ilyin no hes safe have i disgraced myself in any way nothats not it something else resembling remorse tormented him yesoh yes that french officer with the dimple and i remember how my armpaused when i raised itrostov saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to havea look at his frenchman with the dimple on his chin he was sitting inhis foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously abouthim the sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound heglanced at rostov with a feigned smile and waved his hand in greetingrostov still had the same indefinite feeling as of shameall that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that rostovwithout being dull or angry was silent thoughtful and preoccupied hedrank reluctantly tried to remain alone and kept turning somethingover in his mindrostov was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his which tohis amazement had gained him the st georges cross and even given him areputation for bravery and there was something he could not at allunderstand so others are even more afraid than i am he thought sothats all there is in what is called heroism and did i do it for mycountrys sake and how was he to blame with his dimple and blue eyesand how frightened he was he thought that i should kill him why shouldi kill him my hand trembled and they have given me a st georgescross i cant make it out at allbut while nicholas was considering these questions and still could reachno clear solution of what puzzled him so the wheel of fortune in theservice as often happens turned in his favor after the affair atostrovna he was brought into notice received command of an hussarbattalion and when a brave officer was needed he was chosenon receiving news of natashas illness the countess though not quitewell yet and still weak went to moscow with petya and the rest of thehousehold and the whole family moved from marya dmitrievnas house totheir own and settled down in townnatashas illness was so serious that fortunately for her and for herparents the consideration of all that had caused the illness herconduct and the breaking off of her engagement receded into thebackground she was so ill that it was impossible for them to considerin how far she was to blame for what had happened she could not eat orsleep grew visibly thinner coughed and as the doctors made themfeel was in danger they could not think of anything but how to helpher doctors came to see her singly and in consultation talked much infrench german and latin blamed one another and prescribed a greatvariety of medicines for all the diseases known to them but the simpleidea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the diseasenatasha was suffering from as no disease suffered by a live man can beknown for every living person has his own peculiarities and always hashis own peculiar personal novel complicated disease unknown tomedicinenot a disease of the lungs liver skin heart nerves and soon mentioned in medical books but a disease consisting of one of theinnumerable combinations of the maladies of those organs this simplethought could not occur to the doctors as it cannot occur to a wizardthat he is unable to work his charms because the business of theirlives was to cure and they received money for it and had spent the bestyears of their lives on that business but above all that thought waskept out of their minds by the fact that they saw they were reallyuseful as in fact they were to the whole rostov family theirusefulness did not depend on making the patient swallow substances forthe most part harmful the harm was scarcely perceptible as they weregiven in small doses but they were useful necessary andindispensable because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and ofthose who loved herand that is why there are and always will bepseudohealers wise women homeopaths and allopaths they satisfiedthat eternal human need for hope of relief for sympathy and thatsomething should be done which is felt by those who are suffering theysatisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in a child when itwants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt a child knocks itselfand runs at once to the arms of its mother or nurse to have the achingspot rubbed or kissed and it feels better when this is done the childcannot believe that the strongest and wisest of its people have noremedy for its pain and the hope of relief and the expression of itsmothers sympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it the doctors wereof use to natasha because they kissed and rubbed her bump assuring herthat it would soon pass if only the coachman went to the chemists inthe arbat and got a powder and some pills in a pretty box for a rubleand seventy kopeks and if she took those powders in boiled water atintervals of precisely two hours neither more nor lesswhat would sonya and the count and countess have done how would theyhave looked if nothing had been done if there had not been those pillsto give by the clock the warm drinks the chicken cutlets and all theother details of life ordered by the doctors the carrying out of whichsupplied an occupation and consolation to the family circle how wouldthe count have borne his dearly loved daughters illness had he notknown that it was costing him a thousand rubles and that he would notgrudge thousands more to benefit her or had he not known that if herillness continued he would not grudge yet other thousands and would takeher abroad for consultations there and had he not been able to explainthe details of how metivier and feller had not understood the symptomsbut frise had and mudrov had diagnosed them even better what would thecountess have done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalidfor not strictly obeying the doctors ordersyoull never get well like that she would say forgetting her griefin her vexation if you wont obey the doctor and take your medicine atthe right time you mustnt trifle with it you know or it may turn topneumonia she would go on deriving much comfort from the utterance ofthat foreign word incomprehensible to others as well as to herselfwhat would sonya have done without the glad consciousness that she hadnot undressed during the first three nights in order to be ready tocarry out all the doctors injunctions with precision and that shestill kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time when theslightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be administeredeven to natasha herself it was pleasant to see that so many sacrificeswere being made for her sake and to know that she had to take medicineat certain hours though she declared that no medicine would cure herand that it was all nonsense and it was even pleasant to be able toshow by disregarding the orders that she did not believe in medicaltreatment and did not value her lifethe doctor came every day felt her pulse looked at her tongue andregardless of her griefstricken face joked with her but when he hadgone into another room to which the countess hurriedly followed him heassumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said that thoughthere was danger he had hopes of the effect of this last medicine andone must wait and see that the malady was chiefly mental but andthe countess trying to conceal the action from herself and from himslipped a gold coin into his hand and always returned to the patientwith a more tranquil mindthe symptoms of natashas illness were that she ate little sleptlittle coughed and was always lowspirited the doctors said that shecould not get on without medical treatment so they kept her in thestifling atmosphere of the town and the rostovs did not move to thecountry that summer of in spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders outof the little bottles and boxes of which madame schoss who was fond ofsuch things made a large collection and in spite of being deprived ofthe country life to which she was accustomed youth prevailed natashasgrief began to be overlaid by the impressions of daily life it ceasedto press so painfully on her heart it gradually faded into the pastand she began to recover physicallynatasha was calmer but no happier she not merely avoided all externalforms of pleasureballs promenades concerts and theatersbut shenever laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter she could notsing as soon as she began to laugh or tried to sing by herself tearschoked her tears of remorse tears at the recollection of those puretimes which could never return tears of vexation that she should souselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happylaughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy inface of her sorrow without any need of selfrestraint no wish tocoquet ever entered her head she said and felt at that time that no manwas more to her than nastasya ivanovna the buffoon something stoodsentinel within her and forbade her every joy besides she had lost allthe old interests of her carefree girlish life that had been so full ofhope the previous autumn the hunting uncle and the christmasholidays spent with nicholas at otradnoe were what she recalled oftenestand most painfully what would she not have given to bring back even asingle day of that time but it was gone forever her presentiment atthe time had not deceived herthat that state of freedom and readinessfor any enjoyment would not return again yet it was necessary to liveonit comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had formerlyimagined but worse much worse than anybody else in the world butthis was not enough she knew that and asked herself what next butthere was nothing to come there was no joy in life yet life waspassing natasha apparently tried not to be a burden or a hindrance toanyone but wanted nothing for herself she kept away from everyone inthe house and felt at ease only with her brother petya she liked to bewith him better than with the others and when alone with him shesometimes laughed she hardly ever left the house and of those who cameto see them was glad to see only one person pierre it would have beenimpossible to treat her with more delicacy greater care and at thesame time more seriously than did count bezukhov natasha unconsciouslyfelt this delicacy and so found great pleasure in his society but shewas not even grateful to him for it nothing good on pierres partseemed to her to be an effort it seemed so natural for him to be kindto everyone that there was no merit in his kindness sometimes natashanoticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presenceespecially when he wanted to do something to please her or feared thatsomething they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her shenoticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and shynesswhich she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was to herafter those involuntary wordsthat if he were free he would have askedon his knees for her hand and her loveuttered at a moment when she wasso strongly agitated pierre never spoke to natasha of his feelings andit seemed plain to her that those words which had then so comfortedher were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comforta crying child it was not because pierre was a married man but becausenatasha felt very strongly with him that moral barrier the absence ofwhich she had experienced with kuragin that it never entered her headthat the relations between him and herself could lead to love on herpart still less on his or even to the kind of tender selfconsciousromantic friendship between a man and a woman of which she had knownseveral instancesbefore the end of the fast of st peter agrafena ivanovna belova acountry neighbor of the rostovs came to moscow to pay her devotions atthe shrines of the moscow saints she suggested that natasha should fastand prepare for holy communion and natasha gladly welcomed the ideadespite the doctors orders that she should not go out early in themorning natasha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacramentnot as they generally prepared for it in the rostov family by attendingthree services in their own house but as agrafena ivanovna did bygoing to church every day for a week and not once missing vespersmatins or massthe countess was pleased with natashas zeal after the poor results ofthe medical treatment in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayermight help her daughter more than medicines and though not without fearand concealing it from the doctor she agreed to natashas wish andentrusted her to belova agrafena ivanovna used to come to wake natashaat three in the morning but generally found her already awake she wasafraid of being late for matins hastily washing and meekly putting onher shabbiest dress and an old mantilla natasha shivering in the freshair went out into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawnby agrafena ivanovnas advice natasha prepared herself not in their ownparish but at a church where according to the devout agrafenaivanovna the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life there werenever many people in the church natasha always stood beside belova inthe customary place before an icon of the blessed virgin let into thescreen before the choir on the left side and a feeling new to her ofhumility before something great and incomprehensible seized her when atthat unusual morning hour gazing at the dark face of the virginilluminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning lightfalling from the window she listened to the words of the service whichshe tried to follow with understanding when she understood them herpersonal feeling became interwoven in the prayers with shades of itsown when she did not understand it was sweeter still to think that thewish to understand everything is pride that it is impossible tounderstand all that it is only necessary to believe and to commitoneself to god whom she felt guiding her soul at those moments shecrossed herself bowed low and when she did not understand in horrorat her own vileness simply asked god to forgive her everythingeverything to have mercy upon her the prayers to which she surrenderedherself most of all were those of repentance on her way home at anearly hour when she met no one but bricklayers going to work or mensweeping the street and everybody within the houses was still asleepnatasha experienced a feeling new to her a sense of the possibility ofcorrecting her faults the possibility of a new clean life and ofhappinessduring the whole week she spent in this way that feeling grew everyday and the happiness of taking communion or communing as agrafenaivanovna joyously playing with the word called it seemed to natashaso great that she felt she should never live till that blessed sundaybut the happy day came and on that memorable sunday when dressed inwhite muslin she returned home after communion for the first time formany months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the lifethat lay before herthe doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue thepowders he had prescribed a fortnight previouslyshe must certainly go on taking them morning and evening said heevidently sincerely satisfied with his success only please beparticular about itbe quite easy he continued playfully as he adroitly took the goldcoin in his palm she will soon be singing and frolicking about thelast medicine has done her a very great deal of good she has freshenedup very muchthe countess with a cheerful expression on her face looked down at hernails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing roomat the beginning of july more and more disquieting reports about the warbegan to spread in moscow people spoke of an appeal by the emperor tothe people and of his coming himself from the army to moscow and as upto the eleventh of july no manifesto or appeal had been receivedexaggerated reports became current about them and about the position ofrussia it was said that the emperor was leaving the army because it wasin danger it was said that smolensk had surrendered that napoleon hadan army of a million and only a miracle could save russiaon the eleventh of july which was saturday the manifesto was receivedbut was not yet in print and pierre who was at the rostovs promisedto come to dinner next day sunday and bring a copy of the manifestoand appeal which he would obtain from count rostopchinthat sunday the rostovs went to mass at the razumovskis private chapelas usual it was a hot july day even at ten oclock when the rostovsgot out of their carriage at the chapel the sultry air the shouts ofhawkers the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd the dusty leavesof the trees on the boulevard the sounds of the band and the whitetrousers of a battalion marching to parade the rattling of wheels onthe cobblestones and the brilliant hot sunshine were all full of thatsummer languor that content and discontent with the present which ismost strongly felt on a bright hot day in town all the moscownotabilities all the rostovs acquaintances were at the razumovskischapel for as if expecting something to happen many wealthy familieswho usually left town for their country estates had not gone away thatsummer as natasha at her mothers side passed through the crowdbehind a liveried footman who cleared the way for them she heard ayoung man speaking about her in too loud a whisperthats rostova the one whoshes much thinner but all the same shes prettyshe heard or thought she heard the names of kuragin and bolkonski butshe was always imagining that it always seemed to her that everyone wholooked at her was thinking only of what had happened to her with asinking heart wretched as she always was now when she found herself ina crowd natasha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace walkedas women can walkwith the more repose and stateliness the greater thepain and shame in her soul she knew for certain that she was prettybut this no longer gave her satisfaction as it used to on the contraryit tormented her more than anything else of late and particularly so onthis bright hot summer day in town its sunday againanother weekpast she thought recalling that she had been here the sunday beforeand always the same life that is no life and the same surroundings inwhich it used to be so easy to live im pretty im young and i knowthat now i am good i used to be bad but now i know i am good shethought but yet my best years are slipping by and are no good toanyone she stood by her mothers side and exchanged nods withacquaintances near her from habit she scrutinized the ladies dressescondemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not crossingherself properly but in a cramped manner and again she thought withvexation that she was herself being judged and was judging others andsuddenly at the sound of the service she felt horrified at her ownvileness horrified that the former purity of her soul was again lost tohera comely freshlooking old man was conducting the service with thatmild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on thesouls of the worshipers the gates of the sanctuary screen were closedthe curtain was slowly drawn and from behind it a soft mysterious voicepronounced some words tears the cause of which she herself did notunderstand made natashas breast heave and a joyous but oppressivefeeling agitated herteach me what i should do how to live my life how i may grow goodforever forever she pleadedthe deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen andholding his thumb extended drew his long hair from under his dalmaticand making the sign of the cross on his breast began in a loud andsolemn voice to recite the words of the prayerin peace let us pray unto the lordas one community without

for them she included among herenemies the creditors and all who had business dealings with her fatherand always at the thought of enemies and those who hated her sheremembered anatole who had done her so much harmand though he did nothate her she gladly prayed for him as for an enemy only at prayer didshe feel able to think clearly and calmly of prince andrew and anatoleas men for whom her feelings were as nothing compared with her awe anddevotion to god when they prayed for the imperial family and the synodshe bowed very low and made the sign of the cross saying to herselfthat even if she did not understand still she could not doubt and atany rate loved the governing synod and prayed for itwhen he had finished the litany the deacon crossed the stole over hisbreast and said let us commit ourselves and our whole lives to christthe lordcommit ourselves to god natasha inwardly repeated lord god isubmit myself to thy will she thought i want nothing wish fornothing teach me what to

to take her and deliver her from herselffrom her regrets desires remorse hopes and sinsthe countess looked round several times at her daughters softened faceand shining eyes and prayed god to help herunexpectedly in the middle of the service and not in the usual ordernatasha knew so well the deacon brought out a small stool the one heknelt on when praying on trinity sunday and placed it before

be allglory to father son and holy ghost now and forever world withoutend amenin natashas receptive condition of soul this prayer affected herstrongly she listened to every word about the victory of moses overamalek of gideon over midian and of david over goliath and about thedestruction of thy jerusalem and she prayed to god with thetenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing but withoutfully understanding what she was asking of god in that prayer sheshared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousnessfor the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope and its animationby love but she could not pray that her enemies might be trampled underfoot when but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more ofthem that she might pray for them but neither could she doubt therighteousness of the prayer that was being read on bended knees shefelt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe at the thought of thepunishment that overtakes men for their sins and especially of her ownsins and she prayed to god to forgive them all and her too and togive them all and her too peace and happiness and it seemed to herthat god heard her prayerfrom the day when pierre after leaving the rostovs with natashasgrateful look fresh in his mind had gazed at the comet that seemed tobe fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his ownhorizonfrom that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of allearthly things that had incessantly tormented him no longer presenteditself that terrible question why wherefore which had come to himamid every occupation was now replaced not by another question or by areply to the former question but by her image when he listened to orhimself took part in trivial conversations when he read or heard ofhuman baseness or folly he was not horrified as formerly and did notask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is sotransient and incomprehensiblebut he remembered her as he had lastseen her and all his doubts vanishednot because she had answered thequestions that had haunted him but because his conception of hertransferred him instantly to another a brighter realm of spiritualactivity in which no one could be justified or guiltya realm of beautyand love which it was worth living for whatever worldly basenesspresented itself to him he said to himselfwell supposing n n swindled the country and the tsar and thecountry and the tsar confer honors upon him what does that matter shesmiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again and i love her andno one will ever know it and his soul felt calm and peacefulpierre still went into society drank as much and led the same idle anddissipated life because besides the hours he spent at the rostovsthere were other hours he had to spend somehow and the habits andacquaintances he had made in moscow formed a current that bore him alongirresistibly but latterly when more and more disquieting reports camefrom the seat of war and natashas health began to improve and she nolonger aroused in him the former feeling of careful pity an everincreasing restlessness which he could not explain took possession ofhim he felt that the condition he was in could not continue long thata catastrophe was coming which would change his whole life and heimpatiently sought everywhere for signs of that approaching catastropheone of his brother masons had revealed to pierre the following prophecyconcerning napoleon drawn from the revelation of st johnhere is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of thebeast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundredthreescore and sixand in the fifth verse of the and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things andblasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and twomonthsthe french alphabet written out with the same numerical values as thehebrew in which the first nine letters denote units and the otherstens will have the following significancea   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   k                          l    m    n    o    p    q    r    s                    t    u    v    w    x    y            z writing the words lempereur napoleon in numbers it appears that thesum of them is  and that napoleon was therefore the beast foretoldin the apocalypse moreover by applying the same system to the wordsquarantedeux  which was the term allowed to the beast that spokegreat things and blasphemies the same number  was obtained fromwhich it followed that the limit fixed for napoleons power had come inthe year  when the french emperor was fortytwo this prophecypleased pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put anend to the power of the beast that is of napoleon and tried by thesame system of using letters as numbers and adding them up to find ananswer to the question that engrossed him he wrote the words lempereuralexandre la nation russe and added up their numbers but the sums wereeither more or less than  once when making such calculations hewrote down his own name in french comte pierre besouhoff but the sumof the numbers did not come right then he changed the spellingsubstituting a z for the s and adding de and the article le stillwithout obtaining the desired result then it occurred to him if theanswer to the question were contained in his name his nationality wouldalso be given in the answer so he wrote le russe besuhof and adding upthe numbers got  this was only five too much and five wasrepresented by e the very letter elided from the article le before theword empereur by omitting the e though incorrectly pierre got theanswer he sought lrusse besuhof made  this discovery excited himhow or by what means he was connected with the great event foretold inthe apocalypse he did not know but he did not doubt that connection fora moment his love for natasha antichrist napoleon the invasion thecomet  lempereur napoleon and lrusse besuhofall this had tomature and culminate to lift him out of that spellbound petty sphereof moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to agreat achievement and great happiness fortytwoon the eve of the sunday when the special prayer was read pierre hadpromised the rostovs to bring them from count rostopchin whom he knewwell both the appeal to the people and the news from the army in themorning when he went to call at rostopchins he met there a courierfresh from the army an acquaintance of his own who often danced atmoscow ballsdo please for heavens sake relieve me of something said thecourier i have a sackful of letters to parentsamong these letters was one from nicholas rostov to his father pierretook that letter and rostopchin also gave him the emperors appeal tomoscow which had just been printed the last army orders and his ownmost recent bulletin glancing through the army orders pierre found inone of them in the lists of killed wounded and rewarded the name ofnicholas rostov awarded a st georges cross of the fourth class forcourage shown in the ostrovna affair and in the same order the name ofprince andrew bolkonski appointed to the command of a regiment ofchasseurs though he did not want to remind the rostovs of bolkonskipierre could not refrain from making them happy by the news of theirsons having received a decoration so he sent that printed army orderand nicholas letter to the rostovs keeping the appeal the bulletinand the other orders to take with him when he went to dinnerhis conversation with count rostopchin and the latters tone of anxioushurry the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badlythings were going in the army the rumors of the discovery of spies inmoscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that napoleon promised tobe in both the russian capitals by the autumn and the talk of theemperors being expected to arrive next dayall aroused with freshforce that feeling of agitation and expectation in pierre which he hadbeen conscious of ever since the appearance of the comet and especiallysince the beginning of the warhe had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done sohad he not been hindered first by his membership of the society offreemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached perpetualpeace and the abolition of war and secondly by the fact that when hesaw the great mass of muscovites who had donned uniform and were talkingpatriotism he somehow felt ashamed to take the step but the chiefreason for not carrying out his intention to enter the army lay in thevague idea that he was lrusse besuhof who had the number of the beast that his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the powerof the beast that spoke great and blasphemous things had beenpredestined from eternity and that therefore he ought not to undertakeanything but wait for what was bound to come to passa few intimate friends were dining with the rostovs that day as usualon sundayspierre came early so as to find them alonehe had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had henot been so tall so broad of limb and so strong that he carried hisbulk with evident easehe went up the stairs puffing and muttering something his coachman didnot even ask whether he was to wait he knew that when his master was atthe rostovs he stayed till midnight the rostovs footman rushedeagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take his hat andstick pierre from club habit always left both hat and stick in theanteroomthe first person he saw in the house was natasha even before he sawher while taking off his cloak he heard her she was practicing solfaexercises in the music room he knew that she had not sung since herillness and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him heopened the door softly and saw her in the lilac dress she had worn atchurch walking about the room singing she had her back to him when heopened the door but when turning quickly she saw his broad surprisedface she blushed and came rapidly up to himi want to try to sing again she said adding as if by way of excuseit is at least something to dothats capitalhow glad i am youve come i am so happy today she said with the oldanimation pierre had not seen in her for a long time you know nicholashas received a st georges cross i am so proud of himoh yes i sent that announcement but i dont want to interrupt youhe added and was about to go to the drawing roomnatasha stopped himcount is it wrong of me to sing she said blushing and fixing hereyes inquiringly on himno why should it be on the contrary but why do you ask mei dont know myself natasha answered quickly but i should not liketo do anything you disapproved of i believe in you completely youdont know how important you are to me how much youve done for meshe spoke rapidly and did not notice how pierre flushed at her words isaw in that same army order that he bolkonski she whispered the namehastily is in russia and in the army again what do you thinkshewas speaking hurriedly evidently afraid her strength might fail herwill he ever forgive me will he not always have a bitter feelingtoward me what do you think what do you thinki think pierre replied that he has nothing to forgive if iwere in his placeby association of ideas pierre was at once carried back to the daywhen trying to comfort her he had said that if he were not himself butthe best man in the world and free he would ask on his knees for herhand and the same feeling of pity tenderness and love took possessionof him and the same words rose to his lips but she did not give himtime to say themyes you you she said uttering the word you rapturouslythats a different thing i know no one kinder more generous orbetter than you nobody could be had you not been there then and nowtoo i dont know what would have become of me becausetears suddenly rose in her eyes she turned away lifted her musicbefore her eyes began singing again and again began walking up

youll be late for dinneroh and my coachman has gonebut sonya who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom hadfound them in pierres hat where he had carefully tucked them under thelining pierre

silent and preoccupied all through dinner seeming notto grasp what was said he looked at the countoh yes the war he said no what sort of warrior should i make andyet everything is so strange so strange i cant make it out i dontknow i am very far from having military tastes but in these times noone can answer for himselfafter dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy chair andwith a serious face asked sonya who was considered an excellent readerto read the appealto moscow our ancient capitalthe enemy has entered the borders of russia with immense forces hecomes to despoil our beloved countrysonya read painstakingly in her highpitched voice the count listenedwith closed eyes heaving abrupt sighs at certain passagesnatasha sat erect gazing with a searching look now at her father andnow at pierrepierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round the countessshook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression inthe manifesto in all these words she saw only that the dangerthreatening her son would not soon be over shinshin with a sarcasticsmile on his lips was evidently preparing to make fun of anything thatgave him the opportunity

sniffingrepeatedly as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his nose and headded let the emperor but say the word and well sacrifice everythingand begrudge nothingbefore shinshin had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on thecounts patriotism natasha jumped up from her place and ran to herfatherwhat a darling our papa is she cried kissing him and she againlooked at pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned to herwith her better spiritsthere heres a patriot for you said shinshinnot a patriot at all but simply natasha replied in an injuredtone everything seems funny to you but this isnt at all a jokea joke indeed put in the count let him but say the word and wellall go were not germansbut did you notice it says for consultation said pierrenever mind what its forat this moment petya to whom nobody was paying any attention came upto his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking voicethat was now deep and now shrillwell papa i tell you

i tell youpeter kirilych here will also tell younonsense i tell you your mothers milk has hardly dried on your lipsand you want to go into the army there there i tell you and thecount moved to go out of the room taking the papers probably to rereadthem in his study before having a napwell peter kirilych lets go and have a smoke he saidpierre was agitated and undecided natashas unwontedly brilliant eyescontinually glancing at him with a more than cordial look had reducedhim to this conditionno i think ill go homehome why you meant to spend the evening with us you dont oftencome nowadays as it is and this girl of mine said the count goodnaturedly pointing to natasha only brightens up when youre hereyes i had forgotten i really must go home business saidpierre hurriedlywell then au revoir said the count and went out of the roomwhy are you going why are you upset asked natasha and she lookedchallengingly into pierres eyesbecause i love you was what he wanted to say but he did not say itand only blushed till the tears came and lowered his eyesbecause it is better for me to come less often because no simplyi have businesswhy no tell me natasha began resolutely and suddenly stoppedthey looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces he triedto smile but could not his smile expressed suffering and he silentlykissed her hand and went outpierre made up his mind not to go to the rostovs any moreafter the definite refusal he had received petya went to his room andthere locked himself in and wept bitterly when he came in to teasilent morose and with tearstained face everybody pretended not tonotice anythingnext day the emperor arrived in moscow and several of the rostovsdomestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him thatmorning petya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and collarto look like a grownup man he frowned before his looking glassgesticulated shrugged his shoulders and finally without saying a wordto anyone took his cap and left the house by the back door trying toavoid notice petya decided to go straight to where the emperor was andto explain frankly to some gentlemaninwaiting he imagined the emperorto be always surrounded by gentlemeninwaiting that he count rostovin spite of his youth wished to serve his country that youth could beno hindrance to loyalty and that he was ready to while dressingpetya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the gentlemaninwaitingit was on the very fact of being so young that petya counted for successin reaching the emperorhe even thought how surprised everyone would beat his youthfulnessand yet in the arrangement of his collar and hairand by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a grownup manbut the farther he went and the more his attention was diverted by theeverincreasing crowds moving toward the kremlin the less he rememberedto walk with the sedateness and deliberation of a man as he approachedthe kremlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuckout his elbows in a menacing way but within the trinity gateway he wasso pressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of thepatriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of all hisdetermination he had to give in and stop while carriages passed inrumbling beneath the archway beside petya stood a peasant woman afootman two tradesmen and a discharged soldier after standing sometime in the gateway petya tried to move forward in front of the otherswithout waiting for all the carriages to pass and he began resolutelyworking his way with his elbows but the woman just in front of him whowas the first against whom he directed his efforts angrily shouted athimwhat are you shoving for young lordling dont you see were allstanding still then why pushanybody can shove said the footman and also began working his elbowsto such effect that he pushed petya into a very filthy corner of thegatewaypetya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the dampcollar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a manshe felt that he no longer looked presentable and feared that if he werenow to approach the gentlemeninwaiting in that plight he would not beadmitted to the emperor but it was impossible to smarten oneself up ormove to another place because of the crowd one of the generals whodrove past was an acquaintance of the rostovs and petya thought ofasking his help but came to the conclusion that that would not be amanly thing to do when the carriages had all passed in the crowdcarrying petya with it streamed forward into the kremlin square whichwas already full of people there were people not only in the squarebut everywhereon the slopes and on the roofs as soon as petya foundhimself in the square he clearly heard the sound of bells and the joyousvoices of the crowd that filled the whole kremlinfor a while the crowd was less dense but suddenly all heads were baredand everyone rushed forward in one direction petya was being pressed sothat he could scarcely breathe and everybody shouted hurrah hurrahhurrah petya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched but could seenothing except the people about himall the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm atradesmans wife standing beside petya sobbed and the tears ran downher cheeksfather angel dear one she kept repeating wiping away her tearswith her fingershurrah was heard on all sidesfor a moment the crowd stood still but then it made another rushforwardquite beside himself petya clinching his teeth and rolling his eyesferociously pushed forward elbowing his way and shouting hurrah asif he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else buton both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushedforward and everybody shouted hurrahso this is what the emperor is thought petya no i cant petitionhim myselfthat would be too bold but in spite of this he continuedto struggle desperately forward and from between the backs of those infront he caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red clothspread out on it but just then the crowd swayed backthe police infront were pushing back those who had pressed too close to theprocession the emperor was passing from the palace to the cathedral ofthe assumptionand petya unexpectedly received such a blow on his sideand ribs and was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew dimbefore his eyes and he lost consciousness when he came to himself aman of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back of hishead and wearing a shabby blue cassockprobably a church clerk andchanterwas holding him under the arm with one hand while warding offthe pressure of the crowd with the otheryouve crushed the young

the cannon from where he hoped to see the emperor who wouldbe returning that way petya no longer thought of presenting hispetition if he could only see the emperor he would be happywhile the service was proceeding in the cathedral of the assumptionitwas a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the emperorsarrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the turksthe crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared selling kvasgingerbread and poppyseed sweets of which petya was particularlyfond and ordinary conversation could again be heard a tradesmanswife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much the shawl hadcost another was saying that all silk goods had now got dear the clerkwho had rescued petya was talking to a functionary about the priests whowere officiating that day with the bishop the clerk several times usedthe word plenary of the service a word petya did not understandtwo young citizens were joking with some serf girls who were crackingnuts all these conversations especially the joking with the girlswere such as might have had a particular charm for petya at his age butthey did not interest him now he sat on his elevationthe pedestal ofthe cannonstill agitated as before by the thought of the emperor andby his love for him the feeling of pain and fear he had experiencedwhen he was being crushed together with that of rapture still furtherintensified his sense of the importance of the occasionsuddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the embankmentto celebrate the signing of peace with the turks and the crowd rushedimpetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing petya too wouldhave run there but the clerk who had taken the young gentleman underhis protection stopped him the firing was still proceeding whenofficers generals and gentlemeninwaiting came running out of thecathedral and after them others in a more leisurely manner caps wereagain raised and those who had run to look at the cannon ran backagain at last four men in uniforms and sashes emerged from thecathedral doors hurrah hurrah shouted the crowd againwhich is he which asked petya in a tearful voice of those aroundhim but no one answered him everybody was too excited and petyafixing on one of those four men whom he could not clearly see for thetears of joy that filled his eyes concentrated all his enthusiasm

beganto disperse it was already late and petya had not eaten anything andwas drenched with perspiration yet he did not go home but stood withthat diminishing but still considerable crowd before the

throwing them down from thebalcony petyas eyes grew bloodshot and still more excited by thedanger of being crushed he rushed at the biscuits he did not know whybut he had to have a biscuit from the tsars hand and he felt that hemust not give way he sprang forward and upset an old woman who wascatching at a biscuit the old woman did not consider herself defeatedthough she was lying on the groundshe grabbed at some biscuits but herhand did not reach them petya pushed her hand away with his kneeseized a biscuit and as if fearing to be too late again shoutedhurrah with a voice already hoarsethe emperor went in and after that the greater part of the crowd beganto dispersethere i said if only we waitedand so it was was being joyfullysaid by various peoplehappy as petya was he felt sad at having to go home knowing that allthe enjoyment of that day was over he did not go straight home from thekremlin but called on his friend obolenski who was fifteen and wasalso entering the regiment on returning home petya announced resolutelyand firmly that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would runaway and next day count ilya rostovthough he had not yet quiteyieldedwent to inquire how he could arrange for petya to serve wherethere would be least dangertwo days later on the fifteenth of july an immense number of carriageswere standing outside the sloboda palacethe great halls were full in the first were the nobility and gentry intheir uniforms in the second bearded merchants in fullskirted coats ofblue cloth and wearing medals in the noblemens hall there was anincessant movement and buzz of voices the chief magnates sat on highbacked chairs at a large table under the portrait of the emperor butmost of the gentry were strolling about the roomall these nobles whom pierre met every day at the club or in their ownhouses were in uniformsome in that of catherines day others in thatof emperor paul others again in the new uniforms of alexanders time orthe ordinary uniform of the nobility and the general characteristic ofbeing in uniform imparted something strange and fantastic to thesediverse and familiar personalities both old and young the old mendimeyed toothless bald sallow and bloated or gaunt and wrinkledwere especially striking for the most part they sat quietly in theirplaces and were silent or if they walked about and talked attachedthemselves to someone younger on all these faces as on the faces ofthe crowd petya had seen in the square there was a strikingcontradiction the general expectation of a solemn event and at thesame time the everyday interests in a boston card party peter the cookzinaida dmitrievnas health and so onpierre was there too buttoned up since early morning in a noblemansuniform that had become too tight for him he was agitated thisextraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the merchantclassles etats generaux statesgeneralevoked in him a whole seriesof ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply graven in hissoul thoughts of the contrat social and the french revolution thewords that had struck him in the emperors appealthat the sovereignwas coming to the capital for consultation with his peoplestrengthenedthis idea and imagining that in this direction something importantwhich he had long awaited was drawing near he strolled about watchingand listening to conversations but nowhere finding any confirmation ofthe ideas that occupied himthe emperors manifesto was read evoking enthusiasm and then all movedabout discussing it besides the ordinary topics of conversation pierreheard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand whenthe emperor entered when a ball should be given in the emperors honorwhether they should group themselves by districts or by wholeprovinces and so on but as soon as the war was touched on or whatthe nobility had been convened for the talk became undecided andindefinite then all preferred listening to speakinga middleaged man handsome and virile in the uniform of a retirednaval officer was speaking in one of the rooms and a small crowd waspressing round him pierre went up to the circle that had formed roundthe speaker and listened count ilya rostov in a military uniform ofcatherines time was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowdwith all of whom he was acquainted he too approached that group andlistened with a kindly smile and nods of approval as he always did towhat the speaker was saying the retired naval man was speaking veryboldly as was evident from the expression on the faces of the listenersand from the fact that some people pierre knew as the meekest andquietest of men walked away disapprovingly or expressed disagreementwith him pierre pushed his way into the middle of the group listenedand convinced himself that the man was indeed a liberal but of viewsquite different from his own the naval officer spoke in a particularlysonorous musical and aristocratic baritone voice pleasantlyswallowing his rs and generally slurring his consonants the voice of aman calling out to his servant heah bwing me my pipe it wasindicative of dissipation and the exercise of authoritywhat if the smolensk people have offahd to waise militia for theempewah ah we to take smolensk as our patten if the noble awistocwacyof the pwovince of moscow thinks fit it can show its

well all die fo him addedthe orator with animationcount rostovs mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged pierre butpierre wanted to speak himself he pushed forward feeling stirred butnot yet sure what stirred him or what he would say scarcely had heopened his mouth when one of the senators a man without a tooth in hishead with a shrewd though angry expression standing near the firstspeaker interrupted him evidently accustomed to managing debates andto maintaining an argument he began in low but distinct tonesi imagine sir said he mumbling with his toothless mouth that wehave been summoned here not to discuss whether its best for the empireat the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militiawe have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereignthe emperor has honored us but to judge what is bestconscription orthe militiawe can leave to the supreme authoritypierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement he hardened his heartagainst the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitudeinto the deliberations of the nobility pierre stepped forward andinterrupted him he himself did not yet know what he would say but hebegan to speak eagerly occasionally lapsing into french or expressinghimself in bookish russianexcuse me your excellency he began he was well acquainted with thesenator but thought it necessary on this occasion to address himformally though i dont agree with the gentleman he hesitatedhe wished to say mon tres honorable preopinantmy very honorableopponent with the gentleman whom i have not the honor of knowingi suppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to expresstheir sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which wecan assist our fatherland i imagine he went on warming to hissubject that the emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in usmerely owners of serfs whom we are willing to devote to his service andchair a canon  we are ready to make of ourselvesand not to obtainfrom us any cococounsel food for cannonmany persons withdrew from the circle noticing the senators sarcasticsmile and the freedom of pierres remarks only count rostov was pleasedwith them as he had been pleased with those of the naval officer thesenator and in general with whatever speech he had last heardi think that before discussing these questions pierre continued weshould ask the emperormost respectfully ask his majestyto let usknow the number of our troops and the position in which our army and ourforces now are and thenbut scarcely had pierre uttered these words before he was attacked fromthree sides the most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance aboston player who had always been well disposed toward him stepanstepanovich adraksin adraksin was in uniform and whether as a resultof the uniform or from some other cause pierre saw before him quite adifferent man with a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged faceadraksin shouted at pierrein the first place i tell you we have no right to question the emperorabout that and secondly if the russian nobility had that right theemperor could not answer such a question the troops are moved accordingto the enemys movements and the number of men increases anddecreasesanother voice that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty yearsof age whom pierre had formerly met at the gypsies and knew as a badcardplayer and who also transformed by his uniform came up to pierreinterrupted adraksinyes and this is not a time for discussing he continued but foracting there is war in russia the enemy is advancing to destroyrussia to desecrate the tombs of our fathers to carry off our wivesand children the nobleman smote his breast we will all arise everyone of us will go for our father the tsar he shouted rolling hisbloodshot eyes several approving voices were heard in the crowd weare russians and will not grudge our blood in defense of our faith thethrone and the fatherland we must cease raving if we are sons of ourfatherland we will show europe how russia rises to the defense ofrussiapierre wished to reply but could not get in a word he felt that hiswords apart from what meaning they conveyed were less audible than thesound of his opponents voicecount rostov at the back of the crowd was expressing approval severalpersons briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of aphrase saidthats right quite right just sopierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money hisserfs or himself only one ought to know the state of affairs in orderto be able to improve it but he was unable to speak many voicesshouted and talked at the same time so that count rostov had not timeto signify his approval of them all and the group increased dispersedreformed and then moved with a hum of talk into the largest hall andto the big table not only was pierres attempt to speak unsuccessfulbut he was rudely interrupted pushed aside and people turned away fromhim as from a common enemy this happened not because they weredispleased by the substance of his speech which had even been forgottenafter the many subsequent speeches but to animate it the crowd needed atangible object to love and a tangible object to hate pierre became thelatter many other orators spoke after the excited nobleman and all inthe same tone many spoke eloquently and with originalityglinka the editor of the russian messenger who was recognized criesof author author were heard in the crowd said that hell must berepulsed by hell and that he had seen a child smiling at lightningflashes and thunderclaps but we will not be that childyes yes at thunderclaps was repeated approvingly in the back rowsof the crowdthe crowd drew up to the large table at which sat grayhaired or baldseventyyearold magnates uniformed and besashed almost all of whompierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons or playingboston at the clubs with an incessant hum of voices the crowd advancedto the table pressed by the throng against the high backs of thechairs the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two togetherthose standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to say and hastenedto supply it others in that heat and crush racked their brains to findsome thought and hastened to utter it the old magnates whom pierreknew sat and turned to look first at one and then at another and theirfaces for the most part only expressed the fact that they found it veryhot pierre however felt excited and the general desire to show thatthey were ready to go to all lengthswhich found expression in thetones and looks more than in the substance of the speechesinfected himtoo he did not renounce his opinions but felt himself in some way toblame and wished to justify himselfi only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrificeswhen we know what is needed said he trying to be heard above theother voicesone of the old men nearest to him looked round but his attention wasimmediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the tableyes moscow will be surrendered she will be our expiation shoutedone manhe is the enemy of mankind cried another allow me to speakgentlemen you are crushing meat that moment count rostopchin with his protruding chin and alert eyeswearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder enteredthe room stepping briskly to the front of the crowd of gentryour sovereign the emperor will be here in a moment said rostopchini am straight from the palace seeing the position we are in i thinkthere is little need for discussion the emperor has deigned to summonus and the merchants millions will pour forth from therehe pointedto the merchants hallbut our business is to supply men and not spareourselves that is the least we can doa conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at the tablethe whole consultation passed more than quietly after all the precedingnoise the sound of their old voices saying one after another i agreeor for variety i too am of that opinion and so on had even amournful effectthe secretary was told to write down the resolution of the moscownobility and gentry that they would furnish ten men fully equippedout of every thousand serfs as the smolensk gentry had done theirchairs made a scraping noise as the gentlemen who had conferred rosewith apparent relief and began walking up and down arm in arm tostretch their legs and converse in couplesthe emperor the emperor a sudden cry resounded through the halls andthe whole throng hurried to the entrancethe emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two lines ofnobles every face expressed respectful awestruck curiosity pierrestood rather far off and could not hear all that the emperor said fromwhat he did hear he understood that the emperor spoke of the dangerthreatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the moscownobility he was answered by a voice which informed him of theresolution just arrived atgentlemen said the emperor with a quivering voicethere was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided so thatpierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the emperor sayingwith emotioni never doubted the devotion of the russian nobles but today it hassurpassed my expectations i thank you in the name of the fatherlandgentlemen let us act time is most preciousthe emperor ceased speaking the crowd began pressing round him andrapturous exclamations were heard from all sidesyes most precious a royal word said count rostov with a sob hestood at the back and though he had heard hardly anything understoodeverything in his own wayfrom the hall of the nobility the emperor went to that of the merchantsthere he remained about ten minutes pierre was among those who saw himcome out from the merchants hall with tears of emotion in his eyes asbecame known later he had scarcely begun to address the merchantsbefore tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling voicewhen pierre saw the emperor he was coming out accompanied by twomerchants one of whom pierre knew a fat otkupshchik the other was themayor a man with a thin sallow face and narrow beard both wereweeping tears filled the thin mans eyes and the fat otkupshchiksobbed outright like a child and kept repeatingour lives and propertytake them your majestypierres one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he wasready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything he nowfelt ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and soughtan opportunity of effacing it having heard that count mamonov wasfurnishing a regiment bezukhov at once informed rostopchin that hewould give a thousand men and their maintenanceold rostov could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears andat once consented to petyas request and went himself to enter his namenext day the emperor left moscow the assembled nobles all took offtheir uniforms and settled down again in their homes and clubs and notwithout some groans gave orders to their stewards about the enrollmentfeeling amazed themselves at what they had donenapoleon began the war with russia because he could not resist going todresden could not help having his head turned by the homage hereceived could not help donning a polish uniform and yielding to thestimulating influence of a june morning and could not refrain frombursts of anger in the presence of kurakin and then of balashevalexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personallyinsulted barclay de tolly tried to command the army in the best waybecause he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a greatcommander rostov charged the french because he could not restrain hiswish for a gallop across a level field and in the same way theinnumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord with theirpersonal characteristics habits circumstances and aims they weremoved by fear or vanity rejoiced or were indignant reasoned imaginingthat they knew what they were doing and did it of their own free willbut they all were involuntary tools of history carrying on a workconcealed from them but comprehensible to us such is the inevitablefate of men of action and the higher they stand in the social hierarchythe less are they freethe actors of  have long since left the stage their personalinterests have vanished leaving no trace and nothing remains of thattime but its historic resultsprovidence compelled all these men striving to attain personal aims tofurther the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at allexpectedneither napoleon nor alexander nor still less any of thosewho did the actual fightingthe cause of the destruction of the french army in  is clear to usnow no one will deny that that cause was on the one hand its advanceinto the heart of russia late in the season without any preparation fora winter campaign and on the other the character given to the war bythe burning of russian towns and the hatred of the foe this arousedamong the russian people but no one at the time foresaw what now seemsso evident that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousandmenthe best in the world and led by the best generalcould bedestroyed in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strengthand led by inexperienced commanders as the russian army was not onlydid no one see this but on the russian side every effort was made tohinder the only thing that could save russia while on the french sidedespite napoleons experience and socalled military genius everyeffort was directed to pushing on to moscow at the end of the summerthat is to doing the very thing that was bound to lead to destructionin historical works on the year  french writers are very fond ofsaying that napoleon felt the danger of extending his line that hesought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at smolenskand of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaignwas even then understood russian authors are still fonder of telling usthat from the commencement of the campaign a scythian war plan wasadopted to lure napoleon into the depths of russia and this plan someof them attribute to pfuel others to a certain frenchman others totoll and others again to alexander himselfpointing to notesprojects and letters which contain hints of such a line of action butall these hints at what happened both from the french side and therussian are advanced only because they fit in with the event had thatevent not occurred these hints would have been forgotten as we haveforgotten the thousands and millions of hints and expectations to thecontrary which were current then but have now been forgotten because theevent falsified them there are always so many conjectures as to theissue of any event that however it may end there will always be peopleto say i said then that it would be so quite forgetting that amidtheir innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effectconjectures as to napoleons awareness of the danger of extending hisline and on the russian side as to luring the enemy into the depthsof russia are evidently of that kind and only by much straining canhistorians attribute such conceptions to napoleon and his marshals orsuch plans to the russian commanders all the facts are in flatcontradiction to such conjectures during the whole period of the warnot only was there no wish on the russian side to draw the french intothe heart of the country but from their first entry into russiaeverything was done to stop them and not only was napoleon not afraidto extend his line but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph anddid not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns but very lazilyat the very beginning of the war our armies were divided and our soleaim was to unite them though uniting the armies was no advantage if wemeant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country ouremperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of russiansoil and not to retreat the enormous drissa camp was formed on pfuelsplan and there was no intention of retiring farther the emperorreproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired he couldnot bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach smolensk still lesscould he contemplate the burning of moscow and when our armies didunite he was displeased that smolensk was abandoned and burned without ageneral engagement having been fought under its wallsso thought the emperor and the russian commanders and people were stillmore provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into thedepths of the countrynapoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country andmissed several chances of forcing an engagement in august he was atsmolensk and thought only of how to advance farther though as we nowsee that advance was evidently ruinous to himthe facts clearly show that napoleon did not foresee the danger of theadvance on moscow nor did alexander and the russian commanders thenthink of luring napoleon on but quite the contrary the luring ofnapoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any planfor no one believed it to be possible it resulted from a most complexinterplay of intrigues aims and wishes among those who took part inthe war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable or of the oneway of saving russia everything came about fortuitously the armieswere divided at the commencement of the campaign we tried to unitethem with the evident intention of giving battle and checking theenemys advance and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battlewith a much stronger enemy and necessarily withdrawing the armies at anacute anglewe led the french on to smolensk but we withdrew at anacute angle not only because the french advanced between our two armiesthe angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther becausebarclay de tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by bagration whowould come under his command and bagrationbeing in command of thesecond armytried to postpone joining up and coming under barclayscommand as long as he could bagration was slow in effecting thejunctionthough that was the chief aim of all at headquartersbecauseas he alleged he exposed his army to danger on this march and it wasbest for him to retire more to the left and more to the south worryingthe enemy from flank and rear and securing from the ukraine recruits forhis army and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come underthe command of the detested foreigner barclay whose rank was inferiorto his ownthe emperor was with the army to encourage it but his presence andignorance of what steps to take and the enormous number of advisers andplans destroyed the first armys energy and it retiredthe intention was to make a stand at the drissa camp but paulucciaiming at becoming commanderinchief unexpectedly employed his energyto influence alexander and pfuels whole plan was abandoned and thecommand entrusted to barclay but as barclay did not inspire confidencehis power was limited the armies were divided there was no unity ofcommand and barclay was unpopular but from this confusion divisionand the unpopularity of the foreign commanderinchief there resultedon the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle which we couldnot have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone elseinstead of barclay been in command and on the other an everincreasingindignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zealat last the emperor left the army and as the most convenient and indeedthe only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessaryfor him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation ingeneral to a patriotic war and by this visit of the emperor to moscowthe strength of the russian army was trebledhe left in order not to obstruct the commanderinchiefs undividedcontrol of the army and hoping that more decisive action would then betaken but the command of the armies became still more confused andenfeebled bennigsen the tsarevich and a swarm of adjutants generalremained with the army to keep the commanderinchief under observationand arouse his energy and barclay feeling less free than ever underthe observation of all these eyes of the emperor became still morecautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battlebarclay stood for caution the tsarevich hinted at treachery anddemanded a general engagement lubomirski bronnitski wlocki and theothers of that group stirred up so much trouble that barclay underpretext of sending papers to the emperor dispatched these polishadjutants general to petersburg and plunged into an open struggle withbennigsen and the tsarevichat smolensk the armies at last reunited much as bagration disliked itbagration drove up in a carriage to the house occupied by barclaybarclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report to his seniorofficer bagrationdespite his seniority in rank bagration in this contest of magnanimitytook his orders from barclay but having submitted agreed with himless than ever by the emperors orders bagration reported direct tohim he wrote to arakcheev the emperors confidant it must be as mysovereign pleases but i cannot work with the minister meaningbarclay for gods sake send me somewhere else if only in command of aregiment i cannot stand it here headquarters are so full of germansthat a russian cannot exist and there is no sense in anything i thoughti was really serving my sovereign and the fatherland but it turns outthat i am serving barclay i confess i do not want tothe swarm of bronnitskis and wintzingerodes and their like still furtherembittered the relations between the commanders in chief and even lessunity resulted preparations were made to fight the french beforesmolensk a general was sent to survey the position this generalhating barclay rode to visit a friend of his own a corps commanderand having spent the day with him returned to barclay and condemnedas unsuitable from every point of view the battleground he had notseenwhile disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field ofbattle and while we were looking for the frenchhaving lost touch withthemthe french stumbled upon neverovskis division and reached thewalls of smolenskit was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at smolensk to save ourlines of communication the battle was fought and thousands were killedon both sidessmolensk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the emperor and of thewhole people but smolensk was burned by its own inhabitantswho hadbeen misled by their governor and these ruined inhabitants setting anexample to other russians went to moscow thinking only of their ownlosses but kindling hatred of the foe napoleon advanced farther and weretired thus arriving at the very result which caused his destructionthe day after his son had left prince nicholas sent for princess maryto come to his studywell are you satisfied now said he youve made me quarrel with myson satisfied are you thats all you wanted satisfied it hurtsme it hurts im old and weak and this is what you wanted well thengloat over it gloat over itafter that princess mary did not see her father for a whole week he wasill and did not leave his studyprincess mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the oldprince not only excluded her from his room but did not admitmademoiselle bourienne either tikhon alone attended himat the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former wayof life devoting himself with special activity to building operationsand the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off hisrelations with mademoiselle bourienne his looks and cold tone to hisdaughter seemed to say there you see you plotted against me youlied to prince andrew about my relations with that frenchwoman and mademe quarrel with him but you see i need neither her nor youprincess mary spent half of every day with little nicholas watching hislessons teaching him russian and music herself and talking todessalles the rest of the day she spent over her books with her oldnurse or with gods folk who sometimes came by the back door to seeherof the war princess mary thought as women do think about wars shefeared for her brother who was in it was horrified by and amazed at thestrange cruelty that impels men to kill one another but she did notunderstand the significance of this war which seemed to her like allprevious wars she did not realize the significance of this war thoughdessalles with whom she constantly conversed was passionately interestedin its progress and tried to explain his own conception of it to herand though the gods folk who came to see her reported in their ownway the rumors current among the people of an invasion by antichristand though julie now princess drubetskaya who had resumedcorrespondence with her wrote patriotic letters from moscowi write you in russian my good friend wrote julie in her frenchifiedrussian because i have a detestation for all the french and the samefor their language which i cannot support to hear spoken we inmoscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored emperormy poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in jewish taverns but thenews which i have inspires me yet moreyou heard probably of the heroic exploit of raevski embracing his twosons and saying i will perish with them but we will not be shakenand truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we we wereunshakable we pass the time as we can but in war as in war theprincesses aline and sophie sit whole days with me and we unhappywidows of live men make beautiful conversations over our charpieonly you my friend are missing and so onthe chief reason princess mary did not realize the full significance ofthis war was that the old prince never spoke of it did not recognizeit and laughed at dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner theprinces tone was so calm and confident that princess maryunhesitatingly believed himall that july the old prince was exceedingly active and even animatedhe planned another garden and began a new building for the domesticserfs the only thing that made princess mary anxious about him was thathe slept very little and instead of sleeping in his study as usualchanged his sleeping place every day one day he would order his campbed to be set up in the glass gallery another day he remained on thecouch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there withoutundressing whileinstead of mademoiselle bouriennea serf boy read tohim then again he would spend a night in the dining roomon august  a second letter was received from prince andrew in hisfirst letter which came soon after he had left home prince andrew haddutifully asked his fathers forgiveness for what he had allowed himselfto say and begged to be restored to his favor to this letter the oldprince had replied affectionately and from that time had kept thefrenchwoman at a distance prince andrews second letter written nearvitebsk after the french had occupied that town gave a brief account ofthe whole campaign enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecastsas to the further progress of the war in this letter prince andrewpointed out to his father the danger of staying at bald hills so nearthe theater of war and on the armys direct line of march and advisedhim to move to moscowat dinner that day on dessalles mentioning that the french were saidto have already entered vitebsk the old prince remembered his sonsletterthere was a letter from prince andrew today he said to princess maryhavent you read itno father she replied in a frightened voiceshe could not have read the letter as she did not even know it hadarrivedhe writes about this war said the prince with the ironic smile thathad become habitual

his desk busy withhis will i expect one of the princes favorite occupations of latehad been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his deathand which he called his willand alpatych is being sent to smolensk asked princess maryoh yes he has been waiting to start for some timewhen michael ivanovich returned to the study with the letter the oldprince with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes was sitting at hisopen bureau with screened candles holding a paper in his outstretchedhand and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscripthis remarks as he termed itwhich was to be transmitted to theemperor after his deathwhen michael ivanovich went in there were tears in the princes eyesevoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading hadbeen written he took the letter from michael ivanovichs hand put itin his pocket folded up his papers and called in alpatych who had longbeen waitingthe prince had a list of things to be bought in smolensk and walking upand down the room past alpatych who stood by the door he gave hisinstructionsfirst notepaperdo you hear eight quires like this sample giltedged it must be exactly like the sample varnish sealing wax as inmichael ivanovichs listhe paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notesthen hand to the governor in person a letter about the deednext bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to beof a special shape the prince had himself designed and a leather casehad to be ordered to keep the will inthe instructions to alpatych took over two hours and still the princedid not let him go he sat down sank into thought closed his eyes anddozed off alpatych made a slight movementwell go go if anything more is wanted ill send after youalpatych went out the prince again went to his bureau glanced into itfingered his papers closed the bureau again and sat down at the tableto write to the governorit was already late when he rose after sealing the letter he wished tosleep but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressingthoughts came to him in bed so he called tikhon and went through therooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that nighthe went about looking at every corner every place seemedunsatisfactory but worst of all was his customary couch in the studythat couch was dreadful to him probably because of the oppressivethoughts he had had when lying there it was unsatisfactory everywherebut the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was better thanother places he had never slept there yetwith the help of a footman tikhon brought in the bedstead and beganputting it upthats not right thats not right cried the prince and himselfpushed it a few inches from the corner and then closer in againwell at last ive finished now ill rest thought the prince andlet tikhon undress himfrowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of hiscoat and trousers the prince undressed sat down heavily on the bedand appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at hiswithered yellow legs he was not meditating but only deferring themoment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on thebed ugh how hard it is oh that this toil might end and you wouldrelease me thought he pressing his lips together he made that effortfor the twentythousandth time and lay down but hardly had he done sobefore he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards beneath him as ifit were breathing heavily and jolting this happened to him almost everynight he opened his eyes as they were closingno peace damn them he muttered angry he knew not with whom ahyes there was something else important very important that i waskeeping till i should be in bed the bolts no i told him about themno it was something something in the drawing room princess marytalked some nonsense dessalles that fool said something something inmy pocketcant remembertikhon what did we talk about at dinnerabout

i dontwant anything he shoutedhe put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes and thererose before him the danube at bright noonday reeds the russian campand himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy facevigorous and alert entering potemkins gaily colored tent and aburning sense of jealousy of the favorite agitated him now as stronglyas it had done then he recalled all the words spoken at that firstmeeting with potemkin and he saw before him a plump rather sallowfaced short stout woman the empress mother with her smile and herwords at her first gracious reception of him and then that same face onthe catafalque and the encounter he had with zubov over her coffinabout his right to kiss her handoh quicker quicker to get back to that time and have done with allthe present quicker quickerand that they should leave me in peacebald hills prince nicholas bolkonskis estate lay forty miles eastfrom smolensk and two miles from the main road to moscowthe same evening that the prince gave his instructions to alpatychdessalles having asked to see princess mary told her that as theprince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safetythough from prince andrews letter it was evident that to remain at baldhills might be dangerous he respectfully advised her to send a letterby alpatych to the provincial governor at smolensk asking him to lether know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which baldhills was exposed dessalles wrote this letter to the governor forprincess mary she signed it and it was given to alpatych withinstructions to hand it to the governor and to come back as quickly aspossible if there was dangerhaving received all his orders alpatych wearing a white beaver hatapresent from the

startedon his journey looking round at the fields of yellow rye and the stillgreen thickly growing oats and at other quite black fields just beingplowed a second timeas he went along he looked with pleasure at the years splendid crop ofcorn scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there werealready being reaped made his calculations as to the sowing and theharvest and asked himself whether he had not forgotten any of theprinces ordershaving baited the horses twice on the way he arrived at the town towardevening on the fourth of augustalpatych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops on theroad as he approached smolensk he heard the sounds of distant firingbut these did not impress him what struck him most was the sight of asplendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and which wasbeing mown down by the soldiers evidently for fodder this factimpressed alpatych but in thinking about his own business he soonforgot itall the interests of his life for more than thirty years had beenbounded by the will of the prince and he never went beyond that limiteverything not connected with the execution of the princes orders didnot interest and did not even exist for alpatychon reaching smolensk on the evening of the fourth of august he put up inthe gachina suburb across the dnieper at the inn kept by ferapontovwhere he had been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty yearssome thirty years ago ferapontov by alpatychs advice had bought awood from the prince had begun to trade and now had a house an innand a corn dealers shop in that province

moving along the streetsloaded carts stood at the house next to ferapontovs and women werewailing and lamenting as they said goodby a small watchdog ran roundbarking in front of the harnessed horsesalpatych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and wentstraight to the shed where his horses and trap were the coachman wasasleep he woke him up told him to harness and went into the passagefrom the hosts room came the sounds of a child crying the despairingsobs of a woman and the hoarse angry shouting of ferapontov the cookbegan running hither and thither in the passage like a

let me perish with my little children folks she says are allgone so why she says dont we go and he began beating and pullingher about soat these words alpatych nodded as if in approval and not wishing tohear more went to the door of the room opposite the innkeepers wherehe had left his purchasesyou brute you murderer screamed a thin pale woman who with a babyin her arms and her kerchief torn from her head burst through the doorat that moment and down the steps into the yardferapontov came out after her but on seeing alpatych adjusted hiswaistcoat smoothed his hair yawned and followed alpatych into theopposite roomgoing already said healpatych without answering or looking at his host sorted his packagesand asked how much he owedwell reckon up well have you been to the governors

third cup of tea and getting up ours must have got the best of itthe orders were not to let them in so were in force it seems theysay the other day matthew ivanych platov drove them into the rivermarina and drowned some eighteen thousand in one dayalpatych collected his parcels handed them to the coachman who had comein and settled up with the innkeeper the noise of wheels hoofs andbells was heard from the gateway as a little trap passed outit was by now late in the afternoon half the street was in shadow theother half brightly lit by the sun alpatych looked out of the windowand went to the door suddenly the strange sound of a faroff whistlingand thud was heard followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dullroar that set the windows rattlinghe went out into the street two men were running past toward thebridge from different sides came whistling sounds and the thud ofcannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town but these soundswere hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside thetown and attracted little attention from the inhabitants the town wasbeing bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which napoleon had orderedup after four oclock the people did not at once realize the meaning ofthis bombardmentat first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only arousedcuriosity ferapontovs wife who till then had not ceased wailing underthe shed became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gatelistening to the sounds and looking in silence at the peoplethe cook and a shop assistant came to the gate with lively curiosityeveryone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew overtheir heads several people came round the corner talking eagerlywhat force remarked one knocked the roof and ceiling all tosplintersrouted up the earth like a pig said anotherthats grand it bucks one up laughed the first lucky you jumpedaside or it would have wiped you outothers joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had fallenon a house close to them meanwhile still more projectiles now with theswift sinister whistle of a cannon ball now with the agreeableintermittent whistle of a shell flew over peoples heads incessantlybut not one fell close by they all flew over alpatych was getting intohis trap the innkeeper stood at the gatewhat are you staring at he shouted to the cook who in her red skirtwith sleeves rolled up swinging her bare elbows had stepped to thecorner to listen to what was being saidwhat marvels she exclaimed but hearing her masters voice she turnedback pulling down her tuckedup skirtonce more something whistled but this time quite close swoopingdownwards like a little bird a flame flashed in the middle of thestreet something exploded and the street was shrouded in smokescoundrel what are you doing shouted the innkeeper rushing to thecookat that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from differentsides the frightened baby began to cry and people crowded silentlywith pale faces round the cook the loudest sound in that crowd was herwailingohhh dear souls dear kind souls dont let me die my goodsoulsfive minutes later no one remained in the street the cook with herthigh broken by a shell splinter had been carried into the kitchenalpatych his coachman ferapontovs wife and children and the houseporter were all sitting in the cellar listening the roar of guns thewhistling of projectiles and the piteous moaning of the cook whichrose above the other sounds did not cease for a moment the mistressrocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the cellar asked ina pathetic whisper what had become of her husband who had remained inthe street a shopman who entered told her that her husband had gonewith others to the cathedral whence they were fetching the wonderworking icon of smolensktoward dusk the cannonade began to subside alpatych left the cellar andstopped in the doorway the evening sky that had been so clear wasclouded with smoke through which high up the sickle of the new moonshone strangely now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a hushseemed to reign over the town broken only by the rustle of footstepsthe moaning the distant cries and the crackle of fires which seemedwidespread everywhere the cooks moans had now subsided on two sidesblack curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires throughthe streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly indifferent directions like ants from a ruined anthill several of themran into ferapontovs yard before alpatychs eyes alpatych went out tothe gate a retreating regiment thronging and hurrying blocked thestreetnoticing him an officer said the town is being abandoned get awayget away and then turning to the soldiers shoutedill teach you to run into the yardsalpatych went back to the house called the coachman and told him toset off ferapontovs whole household came out too following alpatychand the coachman the women who had been silent till then suddenlybegan to wail as they looked at the firesthe smoke and even the flamesof which could be seen in the failing twilightand as if in reply thesame kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of the streetinside the shed alpatych and the coachman arranged the tangled reins andtraces of their horses with trembling handsas alpatych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers inferapontovs open shop talking loudly and filling their bags andknapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds just then ferapontov returnedand entered his shop on seeing the soldiers he was about to shout atthem but suddenly stopped and clutching at his hair burst into sobsand laughterloot everything lads dont let those devils get it he cried takingsome bags of flour himself and throwing them into the streetsome of the soldiers were frightened and ran away others went onfilling their bags on seeing alpatych ferapontov turned to himrussia is done for he cried alpatych ill set the place on firemyself were done for and ferapontov ran into the yardsoldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street blocking itcompletely so that alpatych could not pass out and had to waitferapontovs wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting tillit was possible to drive outnight had come there were stars in the sky and the new moon shone outamid the smoke that screened it on the sloping descent to the dnieperalpatychs cart and that of the innkeepers wife which were slowlymoving amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles had to stop ina side street near the crossroads where the vehicles had stopped ahouse and some shops were on fire this fire was already burning itselfout the flames now died down and were lost in the black smoke nowsuddenly flared up again brightly lighting up with strange distinctnessthe faces of the people crowding at the crossroads black figuresflitted about before the fire and through the incessant crackling ofthe flames talking and shouting could be heard seeing that his trapwould not be able to move on for some time alpatych got down and turnedinto the side street to look at the fire soldiers were continuallyrushing backwards and forwards near it and he saw two of them and a manin a frieze coat dragging burning beams into another yard across thestreet while others carried bundles of hayalpatych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn which wasblazing briskly the walls were all on fire and the back wall had fallenin the wooden roof was collapsing and the rafters were alight thecrowd was evidently watching for the roof to fall in and alpatychwatched for it tooalpatych a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old manmercy on us your excellency answered alpatych immediatelyrecognizing the voice of his young princeprince andrew in his riding cloak mounted on a black horse was lookingat alpatych from the back of the crowdwhy are you here he askedyour your excellency stammered alpatych and broke into sobs arewe really lost masterwhy are you here prince andrew repeatedat that moment the flames flared up and showed his young masters paleworn face alpatych told how he had been sent there and how difficult itwas to get awayare we really quite lost your excellency he asked againprince andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his kneebegan writing in pencil on a page he tore out he wrote to his sistersmolensk is being abandoned bald hills will be occupied by the enemywithin a week set off immediately for moscow let me know at once whenyou will start send by special messenger to usvyazhhaving written this and given the paper to alpatych he told him how toarrange for departure of the prince the princess his son and theboys tutor and how and where to let him know immediately before hehad had time to finish giving these instructions a chief of stafffollowed by a suite galloped up to himyou are a colonel shouted the chief of staff with a german accent ina voice familiar to prince andrew houses are set on fire in yourpresence and you stand by what does this mean you will answer for itshouted berg who was now assistant to the chief of staff of thecommander of the left flank of the infantry of the first army a placeas berg said very agreeable and well en evidenceprince andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking toalpatychso tell them that i shall await a reply till the tenth and if by thetenth i dont receive news that they have all got away i shall have tothrow up everything and come myself to bald hillsprince said berg recognizing prince andrew i only spoke because ihave to obey orders because i always do obey exactly you mustplease excuse me he went on apologeticallysomething cracked in the flames the fire died down for a moment andwreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof there was anotherterrible crash and something huge collapsedourourou yelled the crowd echoing the crash of the collapsing roofof the barn the burning grain in which diffused a cakelike aroma allaround the flames flared up again lighting the animated delightedexhausted faces of the spectatorsthe man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shoutedits fine lads now its raging its finethats the owner himself cried several voiceswell then continued prince andrew to alpatych report to them as ihave told you and not replying a word to berg who was now mute besidehim he touched his horse and rode down the side streetfrom smolensk the troops continued to retreat followed by the enemy onthe tenth of august the regiment prince andrew commanded was marchingalong the highroad past the avenue leading to bald hills heat anddrought had continued for more than three weeks each day fleecy cloudsfloated across the sky and occasionally veiled the sun but towardevening the sky cleared again and the sun set in reddishbrown mistheavy night dews alone refreshed the earth the unreaped corn wasscorched and shed its grain the marshes dried up the cattle lowed fromhunger finding no food on the sunparched meadows only at night and inthe forests while the dew lasted was there any freshness but on theroad the highroad along which the troops marched there was no suchfreshness even at night or when the road passed through the forest thedew was imperceptible on the sandy dust churned up more than six inchesdeep as soon as day dawned the march began the artillery and baggagewagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that rose to the veryhubs of the wheels and the infantry sank ankledeep in that softchoking hot dust that never cooled even at night some of this dust waskneaded by the feet and wheels while the rest rose and hung like acloud over the troops settling in eyes ears hair and nostrils andworst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along thatroad the higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust andthrough the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with nakedeye at the sun which showed like a huge crimson ball in the uncloudedsky there was no wind and the men choked in that motionlessatmosphere they marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses andmouths when they passed through a village they all rushed to the wellsand fought for the water and drank it down to the mudprince andrew was in command of a regiment and the management of thatregiment the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving andgiving orders engrossed him the burning of smolensk and itsabandonment made an epoch in his life a novel feeling of anger againstthe foe made him forget his own sorrow he was entirely devoted to theaffairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to his men andofficers in the regiment they called him our prince were proud ofhim and loved him but he was kind and gentle only to those of hisregiment to timokhin and the likepeople quite new to him belongingto a different world and who could not know and understand his past assoon as he came across a former acquaintance or anyone from the staffhe bristled up immediately and grew spiteful ironical andcontemptuous everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant tohim and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himselfto trying to do his duty and not to be unfairin truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light toprince andrew especially after the abandonment of smolensk on the sixthof august he considered that it could and should have been defendedand after his sick father had had to flee to moscow abandoning topillage his dearly beloved bald hills which he had built and peopledbut despite this thanks to his regiment prince andrew had something tothink about entirely apart from general questions two days previouslyhe had received news that his father son and sister had left formoscow and though there was nothing for him to do at bald hills princeandrew with a characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided thathe must ride therehe ordered his horse to be saddled and leaving his regiment on themarch rode to his fathers estate where he had been born and spent hischildhood riding past the pond where there used always to be dozens ofwomen chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with woodenbeetles prince andrew noticed that there was not a soul about and thatthe little washing wharf torn from its place and half submerged wasfloating on its side in the middle of the pond he rode to the keeperslodge no one at the stone entrance gates of the drive and the doorstood open grass had already begun to grow on the garden paths andhorses and calves were straying in the english park prince andrew rodeup to the hothouse some of the glass panes were broken and of thetrees in tubs some were overturned and others dried up he called fortaras the gardener but no one replied having gone round the corner ofthe hothouse to the ornamental garden he saw that the carved gardenfence was broken and branches of the plum trees had been torn off withthe fruit an old peasant whom prince andrew in his childhood had oftenseen at the gate was sitting on a green garden seat plaiting a bastshoehe was deaf and did not hear prince andrew ride up he was sitting onthe seat the old prince used to like to sit on and beside him strips ofbast were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnoliaprince andrew rode up to the house several limes in the old garden hadbeen cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front ofthe house among the rosebushes the shutters were all closed except atone window which was open a little serf boy seeing prince andrew raninto the house alpatych having sent his family away was alone at baldhills and was sitting indoors reading the lives of the saints onhearing that prince andrew had come he went out with his spectacles onhis nose buttoning his coat and hastily stepping up without a wordbegan weeping and kissing prince andrews kneethen vexed at his own weakness he turned away and began to report onthe position of affairs everything precious and valuable had beenremoved to bogucharovo seventy quarters of grain had also been cartedaway the hay and the spring corn of which alpatych said there had beena remarkable crop that year had been commandeered by the troops andmown down while still green the peasants were ruined some of them toohad gone to bogucharovo only a few remainedwithout waiting to hear him out prince andrew askedwhen did my father and sister leave meaning when did they leave formoscowalpatych understanding the question to refer to their departure forbogucharovo replied that they had left on the seventh and again wentinto details concerning the estate management asking for instructionsam i to let the troops have the oats and to take a receipt for themwe have still six hundred quarters left he inquiredwhat am i to say to him thought prince andrew looking down on theold mans bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the expression onhis face that the old man himself understood how untimely such questionswere and only asked them to allay his griefyes let them have it replied prince andrewif you noticed some disorder in the garden said alpatych it wasimpossible to prevent it three regiments have been here and spent thenight dragoons mostly i took down the name and rank of theircommanding officer to hand in a complaint about itwell and what are you going to do will you stay here if the enemyoccupies the place asked prince andrewalpatych turned his face to prince andrew looked at him and suddenlywith a solemn gesture raised his armhe is my refuge his will be done he exclaimeda group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow towardthe princewell goodby said prince andrew bending over to alpatych you mustgo away too take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to theryazan estate or to the one near moscowalpatych clung to prince andrews leg and burst into sobs gentlydisengaging himself the prince spurred his horse and rode down theavenue at a gallopthe old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden like a flyimpassive on the face of a loved one who is dead tapping the last onwhich he was making the bast shoe and two little girls running outfrom the hot house carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked fromthe trees there came upon prince andrew on seeing the young masterthe elder one with frightened look clutched her younger companion by thehand and hid with her behind a birch tree not stopping to pick up somegreen plums they had droppedprince andrew turned away with startled haste unwilling to let them seethat they had been observed he was sorry for the pretty frightenedlittle girl was afraid of looking at her and yet felt an irresistibledesire to do so a new sensation of comfort and relief came over himwhen seeing these girls he realized the existence of other humaninterests entirely aloof from his own and just as legitimate as thosethat occupied him evidently these girls passionately desired one thingto carry away and eat those green plums without being caughtandprince andrew shared their wish for the success of their enterprise hecould not resist looking at them once more believing their danger pastthey sprang from their ambush and chirruping something in their shrilllittle voices and holding up their skirts their bare little sunburnedfeet scampered merrily and quickly across the meadow grassprince andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dustyhighroad along which the troops were moving but not far from bald hillshe again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its haltingplace by the dam of a small pond it was past one oclock the sun ared ball through the dust burned and scorched his back intolerablythrough his black coat the dust always hung motionless above the buzzof talk that came from the resting troops there was no wind as hecrossed the dam prince andrew smelled the ooze and freshness of thepond he longed to get into that water however dirty it might be andhe glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks andlaughter the small muddy green pond had risen visibly more than afoot flooding the dam because it was full of the naked white bodies ofsoldiers with brickred hands necks and faces who were splashingabout in it all this naked white human flesh laughing and shriekingfloundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a wateringcan and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass renderedit specially patheticone fairhaired young soldier of the third company whom prince andrewknew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg crossed himselfstepped back to get a good run and plunged into the water another adark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy stood up to hiswaist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure and snortedwith satisfaction as he poured the water over his head with handsblackened to the wrists there were sounds of men slapping one anotheryelling and puffingeverywhere on the bank on the dam and in the pond there was healthywhite muscular flesh the officer timokhin with his red little nosestanding on the dam wiping himself with a towel felt confused at seeingthe prince but made up his mind to address him neverthelessits very nice your excellency wouldnt you like to said heits dirty replied prince andrew making a grimacewell clear it out for you in a minute said timokhin and stillundressed ran off to clear the men out of the pondthe prince wants to bathewhat prince ours said many voices and the men were in such haste toclear out that the prince could hardly stop them he decided that hewould rather wash himself with water in the barnflesh bodies cannon fodder he thought and he looked at his ownnaked body and shuddered not from cold but from a sense of disgust andhorror he did not himself understand aroused by the sight of thatimmense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pondon the seventh of august prince bagration wrote as follows from hisquarters at mikhaylovna on the smolensk roaddear count alexis andreevichhe was writing to arakcheev but knew thathis letter would be read by the emperor and therefore weighed everyword in it to the best of his abilityi expect the minister barclay de tolly has already reported theabandonment of smolensk to the enemy it is pitiable and sad and thewhole army is in despair that this most important place has beenwantonly abandoned i for my part begged him personally most urgentlyand finally wrote him but nothing would induce him to consent i swearto you on my honor that napoleon was in such a fix as never before andmight have lost half his army but could not have taken smolensk ourtroops fought and are fighting as never before with fifteen thousandmen i held the enemy at bay for thirtyfive hours and beat him but hewould not hold out even for fourteen hours it is disgraceful a stainon our army and as for him he ought it seems to me not to live ifhe reports that our losses were great it is not true perhaps aboutfour thousand not more and not even that but even were they tenthousand thats war but the enemy has lost masseswhat would it have cost him to hold out for another two days they wouldhave had to retire of their own accord for they had no water for men orhorses he gave me his word he would not retreat but suddenly sentinstructions that he was retiring that night we cannot fight in thisway or we may soon bring the enemy to moscowthere is a rumor that you are thinking of peace god forbid that youshould make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats youwould set all russia against you and every one of us would feel ashamedto wear the uniform if it has come to thiswe must fight as long asrussia can and as long as there are men able to standone man ought to be in command and not two your minister may perhapsbe good as a minister but as a general he is not merely bad butexecrable yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole country iam really frantic with vexation forgive my writing boldly it is clearthat the man who advocates the conclusion of a peace and that theminister should command the army does not love our sovereign anddesires the ruin of us all so i write you frankly call out themilitia for the minister is leading these visitors after him to moscowin a most masterly way the whole army feels great suspicion of theimperial aidedecamp wolzogen he is said to be more napoleons manthan ours and he is always advising the minister i am not merely civilto him but obey him like a corporal though i am his senior this ispainful but loving my benefactor and sovereign i submit only i amsorry for the emperor that he entrusts our fine army to such as heconsider that on our retreat we have lost by fatigue and left in thehospital more than fifteen thousand men and had we attacked this wouldnot have happened tell me for gods sake what will russia our motherrussia say to our being so frightened and why are we abandoning ourgood and gallant fatherland to such rabble and implanting feelings ofhatred and shame in all our subjects what are we scared at and of whomare we afraid i am not to blame that the minister is vacillating acoward dense dilatory and has all bad qualities the whole armybewails it and calls down curses upon himamong the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena of humanlife one may discriminate between those in which substance prevails andthose in which form prevails to the latteras distinguished fromvillage country provincial or even moscow lifewe may allotpetersburg life and especially the life of its salons that life of thesalons is unchanging since the year  we had made peace and hadagain quarreled with bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmadethem again but the salons of anna pavlovna and helene remained just asthey had beenthe one seven and the other five years before at annapavlovnas they talked with perplexity of bonapartes successes just asbefore and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by theeuropean sovereigns a malicious conspiracy the sole object of which wasto cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which annapavlovna was the representative and in helenes salon which rumyantsevhimself honored with his visits regarding helene as a remarkablyintelligent woman they talked with the same ecstasy in  as in of the great nation and the great man and regretted our rupturewith france a rupture which according to them ought to be promptlyterminated by peaceof late since the emperors return from the army there had been someexcitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations ofhostility to one another but each camp retained its own tendency inanna pavlovnas circle only those frenchmen were admitted who were deeprooted legitimists and patriotic views were expressed to the effectthat one ought not to go to the french theater and that to maintain thefrench troupe was costing the government as much as a whole army corpsthe progress of the war was eagerly followed and only the reports mostflattering to our army were circulated in the french circle of heleneand rumyantsev the reports of the cruelty of the enemy and of the warwere contradicted and all napoleons attempts at conciliation werediscussed in that circle they discountenanced those who advised hurriedpreparations for a removal to kazan of the court and the girlseducational establishments under the patronage of the dowager empressin helenes circle the war in general was regarded as a series of formaldemonstrations which would very soon end in peace and the viewprevailed expressed by bilibinwho now in petersburg was quite at homein helenes house which every clever man was obliged to visitthat notby gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be settled inthat circle the moscow enthusiasmnews of which had reached petersburgsimultaneously with the emperors returnwas ridiculed sarcasticallyand very cleverly though with much cautionanna pavlovnas circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasmand spoke of it as plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients princevasili who still occupied his former important posts formed aconnecting link between these two circles he visited his good friendanna pavlovna as well as his daughters diplomatic salon and oftenin his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confusedand said at helenes what he should have said at anna pavlovnas andvice versasoon after the emperors return prince vasili in a conversation aboutthe war at anna pavlovnas severely condemned barclay de tolly but wasundecided as to who ought to be appointed commanderinchief one of thevisitors usually spoken of as a man of great merit having describedhow he had that day seen kutuzov the newly chosen chief of thepetersburg militia presiding over the enrollment of recruits at thetreasury cautiously ventured to suggest that kutuzov would be the manto satisfy all requirementsanna pavlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that kutuzov had donenothing but cause the emperor annoyancei have talked and talked at the assembly of the nobility princevasili interrupted but they did not listen to me i told them hiselection as chief of the militia would not please the emperor they didnot listen to meits all this mania for opposition he went on and who for it isall because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those muscovitesprince vasili continued forgetting for a moment that though at helenesone had to ridicule the moscow enthusiasm at anna pavlovnas one had tobe ecstatic about it but he retrieved his mistake at once now is itsuitable that count kutuzov the oldest general in russia shouldpreside at that tribunal he will get nothing for his pains how couldthey make a man commanderinchief who cannot mount a horse who dropsasleep at a council and has the very worst morals a good reputation hemade for himself at bucharest i dont speak of his capacity as ageneral but at a time like this how they appoint a decrepit blind oldman positively blind a fine idea to have a blind general he cant seeanything to play blindmans bluff he cant see at allno one replied to his remarksthis was quite correct on the twentyfourth of july but on the twentyninth of july kutuzov received the title of prince this might indicatea wish to get rid of him and therefore prince vasilis opinioncontinued to be correct though he was not now in any hurry to expressit but on the eighth of august a committee consisting of field marshalsaltykov arakcheev vyazmitinov lopukhin and kochubey met to considerthe progress of the war this committee came to the conclusion that ourfailures were due to a want of unity in the command and though themembers of the committee were aware of the emperors dislike of kutuzovafter a short deliberation they agreed to advise his appointment ascommander in chief that same day kutuzov was appointed commanderinchief with full powers over the armies and over the whole regionoccupied by themon the ninth of august prince vasili at anna pavlovnas again met theman of great merit the latter was very attentive to anna pavlovnabecause he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educationalestablishments for young ladies prince vasili entered the room with theair of a happy conqueror who has attained the object of his desireswell have you heard the great news prince kutuzov is field marshalall dissensions are at an end i am so glad so delighted at last wehave a man said he glancing sternly and significantly round ateveryone in the drawing roomthe man of great merit despite his desire to obtain the post ofdirector could not refrain from reminding prince vasili of his formeropinion though this was impolite to prince vasili in anna pavlovnasdrawing room and also to anna pavlovna herself who had received thenews with delight he could not resist the temptationbut prince they say he is blind said he reminding prince vasili ofhis own wordseh nonsense he sees well enough said prince vasili rapidly in adeep voice and with a slight coughthe voice and cough with which hewas wont to dispose of all difficultieshe sees well enough he added and what i am so pleased about hewent on is that our sovereign has given him full powers over all thearmies and the whole regionpowers no commanderinchief ever hadbefore he is a second autocrat he concluded with a victorious smilegod grant it god grant it said anna pavlovnathe man of great merit who was still a novice in court circleswishing to flatter anna pavlovna by defending her former position onthis question observedit is said that the emperor was reluctant to give kutuzov those powersthey say he blushed like a girl to whom joconde is read when he said tokutuzov your emperor and the fatherland award you this honorperhaps the heart took no part in that speech said anna pavlovnaoh no no warmly rejoined prince vasili who would not now yieldkutuzov to anyone in his opinion kutuzov was not only admirablehimself but was adored by everybody no thats impossible said hefor our sovereign appreciated him so highly beforegod grant only that prince kutuzov assumes real power and does notallow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel observed anna pavlovnaunderstanding at once to whom she alluded prince vasili said in awhisperi know for a fact that kutuzov made it an absolute condition that thetsarevich should not be with the army do you know what he said to theemperorand prince vasili repeated the words supposed to have been spoken bykutuzov to the emperor i can neither punish him if he does wrong norreward him if he does rightoh a very wise man is prince kutuzov i have known him a long timethey even say remarked the man of great merit who did not yetpossess courtly tact that his excellency made it an express conditionthat the sovereign himself should not be with the armyas soon as he said this both prince vasili and anna pavlovna turned awayfrom him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at his naivetewhile this was taking place in petersburg the french had already passedsmolensk and were drawing nearer and nearer to moscow napoleonshistorian thiers like other of his historians trying to justify hishero says that he was drawn to the walls of moscow against his will heis as right as other historians who look for the explanation of historicevents in the will of one man he is as right as the russian historianswho maintain that napoleon was drawn to moscow by the skill of therussian commanders here besides the law of retrospection which regardsall the past as a preparation for events that subsequently occur thelaw of reciprocity comes in confusing the whole matter a goodchessplayer having lost a game is sincerely convinced that his lossresulted from a mistake he made and looks for that mistake in theopening but forgets that at each stage of the game there were similarmistakes and that none of his moves were perfect he only notices themistake to which he pays attention because his opponent took advantageof it how much more complex than this is the game of war which occursunder certain limits of time and where it is not one will thatmanipulates lifeless objects but everything results from innumerableconflicts of various willsafter smolensk napoleon sought a battle beyond dorogobuzh at vyazma andthen at tsarevozaymishche but it happened that owing to a conjunctionof innumerable circumstances the russians could not give battle tillthey reached borodino seventy miles from moscow from vyazma napoleonordered a direct advance on moscowmoscou la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire la ville sacree despeuples dalexandre moscou avec ses innombrables eglises en forme depagodes chinoises  this moscow gave napoleons imagination no rest onthe march from vyazma to tsarevozaymishche he rode his light baybobtailed ambler accompanied by his guards his bodyguard his pagesand aidesdecamp berthier his chief of staff dropped behind toquestion a russian prisoner captured by the cavalry followed bylelorgne dideville an interpreter he overtook napoleon at a gallopand reined in his horse with an amused expression moscow the asiatic capital of this great empire the sacred city ofalexanders people moscow with its innumerable churches shaped likechinese pagodaswell asked napoleonone of platovs cossacks says that platovs corps is joining up withthe main army and that kutuzov has been appointed commanderinchief heis a very shrewd and garrulous fellownapoleon smiled and told them to give the cossack a horse and bring theman to him he wished to talk to him himself several adjutants gallopedoff and an hour later lavrushka the serf denisov had handed over torostov rode up to napoleon in an orderlys jacket and on a frenchcavalry saddle with a merry and tipsy face napoleon told him to rideby his side and began questioning himyou are a cossackyes a cossack your honorthe cossack not knowing in what company he was for napoleons plainappearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an oriental mindthe presence of a monarch talked with extreme familiarity of theincidents of the war says thiers narrating this episode in realitylavrushka having got drunk the day before and left his masterdinnerless had been whipped and sent to the village in quest ofchickens where he engaged in looting till the french took him prisonerlavrushka was one of those coarse barefaced lackeys who have seen allsorts of things consider it necessary to do everything in a mean andcunning way are ready to render any sort of service to their masterand are keen at guessing their masters baser impulses especially thoseprompted by vanity and pettinessfinding himself in the company of napoleon whose identity he had easilyand surely recognized lavrushka was not in the least abashed but merelydid his utmost to gain his new masters favorhe knew very well that this was napoleon but napoleons presence couldno more intimidate him than rostovs or a sergeant majors with therods would have done for he had nothing that either the sergeant majoror napoleon could deprive him ofso he rattled on telling all the gossip he had heard among theorderlies much of it true but when napoleon asked him whether therussians thought they would beat bonaparte or not lavrushka screwed uphis eyes and consideredin this question he saw subtle cunning as men of his type see cunningin everything so he frowned and did not answer immediatelyits like this he said thoughtfully if theres a battle soon yourswill win thats right but if three days pass then after that wellthen that same battle will not soon be overlelorgne dideville smilingly interpreted this speech to napoleon thusif a battle takes place within the next three days the french will winbut if later god knows what will happen napoleon did not smilethough he was evidently in high good humor and he ordered these wordsto be repeatedlavrushka noticed this and to entertain him further pretending not toknow who napoleon was addedwe know that you have bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in theworld but we are a different matterwithout knowing why or howthis bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the endthe interpreter translated these words without the last phrase andbonaparte smiled the young cossack made his mighty interlocutorsmile says thiers after riding a few paces in silence napoleonturned to berthier and said he wished to see how the news that he wastalking to the emperor himself to that very emperor who had written hisimmortally victorious name on the pyramids would affect this enfant dudon  child of the donthe fact was accordingly conveyed to lavrushkalavrushka understanding that this was done to perplex him and thatnapoleon expected him to be frightened to gratify his new masterspromptly pretended to be astonished and awestruck opened his eyeswide and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to bewhipped as soon as napoleons interpreter had spoken says thiersthe cossack seized by amazement did not utter another word but rodeon his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him acrossthe steppes of the east all his loquacity was suddenly arrested andreplaced by a naive and silent feeling of admiration napoleon aftermaking the cossack a present had him set free like a bird restored toits native fieldsnapoleon rode on dreaming of the moscow that so appealed to hisimagination and the bird restored to its native fields galloped toour outposts inventing on the way all that had not taken place but thathe meant to relate to his comrades what had really taken place he didnot wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling he foundthe cossacks inquired for the regiment operating with platovsdetachment and by evening found his master nicholas rostov quarteredat yankovo rostov was just mounting to go for a ride round theneighboring villages with ilyin he let lavrushka have another horse andtook him along with himprincess mary was not in moscow and out of danger as prince andrewsupposedafter the return of alpatych from smolensk the old prince suddenlyseemed to awake as from a dream he ordered the militiamen to be calledup from the villages and armed and wrote a letter to the commanderinchief informing him that he had resolved to remain at bald hills to thelast extremity and to defend it leaving to the commanderinchiefsdiscretion to take measures or not for the defense of bald hills whereone of russias oldest generals would be captured or killed and heannounced to his household that he would remain at bald hillsbut while himself remaining he gave instructions for the departure ofthe princess and dessalles with the little prince to bogucharovo andthence to moscow princess mary alarmed by her fathers feverish andsleepless activity after his previous apathy could not bring herself toleave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobeyhim she refused to go away and her fathers fury broke over her in aterrible storm he repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted onher trying to convict her he told her she had worn him out had causedhis quarrel with his son had harbored nasty suspicions of him makingit the object of her life to poison his existence and he drove her fromhis study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same tohim he declared that he did not wish to remember her existence andwarned her not to dare to let him see her the fact that he did not asshe had feared order her to be carried away by force but only told hernot to let him see her cheered princess mary she knew it was a proofthat in the depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home andhad not gone awaythe morning after little nicholas had left the old prince donned hisfull uniform and prepared to visit the commanderinchief his calechewas already at the door princess mary saw him walk out of the house inhis uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review hisarmed peasants and domestic serfs she sat by the window listening tohis voice which reached her from the garden suddenly several men camerunning up the avenue with frightened facesprincess mary ran out to the porch down the flowerbordered path andinto the avenue a large crowd of militiamen and domestics were movingtoward her and in their midst several men were supporting by thearmpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform anddecorations she ran up to him and in the play of the sunlight thatfell in small round spots through the shade of the limetree avenuecould not be sure what change there was in his face all she could seewas that his former stern and determined expression had altered to oneof timidity and submission on seeing his daughter he moved his helplesslips and made a hoarse sound it was impossible to make out what hewanted he was lifted up carried to his study and laid on the verycouch he had so feared of latethe doctor who was fetched that same night bled him and said that theprince had had a seizure paralyzing his right sideit was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at bald hills andnext day they moved the prince to bogucharovo the doctor accompanyinghimby the time they reached bogucharovo dessalles and the little princehad already left for moscowfor three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the newhouse prince andrew had built at bogucharovo ever in the same stategetting neither better nor worse he was unconscious and lay like adistorted corpse he muttered unceasingly his eyebrows and lipstwitching and it was impossible to tell whether he understood what wasgoing on around him or not one thing was certainthat he was sufferingand wished to say something but what it was no one could tell itmight be some caprice of a sick and halfcrazy man or it might relateto public affairs or possibly to family concernsthe doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due tophysical causes but princess mary thought he wished to tell hersomething and the fact that her presence always increased hisrestlessness confirmed her opinionhe was evidently suffering both physically and mentally there was nohope of recovery it was impossible for him to travel it would not doto let him die on the road would it not be better if the end did comethe very end princess mary sometimes thought night and day hardlysleeping at all she watched him and terrible to say often watched himnot with hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to findsymptoms of the approach of the endstrange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself yetthere it was and what seemed still more terrible to her was that sinceher fathers illness began perhaps even sooner when she stayed withhim expecting something to happen all the personal desires and hopesthat had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened thoughtsthat had not entered her mind for yearsthoughts of a life free fromthe fear of her father and even the possibility of love and of familyhappinessfloated continually in her imagination like temptations ofthe devil thrust them aside as she would questions continuallyrecurred to her as to how she would order her life now after thatthese were temptations of the devil and princess mary knew it she knewthat the sole weapon against him was prayer and she tried to pray sheassumed an attitude of prayer looked at the icons repeated the wordsof a prayer but she could not pray she felt that a different world hadnow taken possession of herthe life of a world of strenuous and freeactivity quite opposed to the spiritual world in which till now she hadbeen confined and in which her greatest comfort had been prayer shecould not pray could not weep and worldly cares took possession ofherit was becoming dangerous to remain in bogucharovo news of the approachof the french came from all sides and in one village ten miles frombogucharovo a homestead had been looted by french maraudersthe doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince theprovincial marshal of the nobility sent an official to princess mary topersuade her to get away as quickly as possible and the head of therural police having come to bogucharovo urged the same thing sayingthat the french were only some twentyfive miles away that frenchproclamations were circulating in the villages and that if the princessdid not take her father away before the fifteenth he could not answerfor the consequencesthe princess decided to leave on the fifteenth the cares of preparationand giving orders for which everyone came to her occupied her all dayshe spent the night of the fourteenth as usual without undressing inthe room next to the one where the prince lay several times waking upshe heard his groans and muttering the creak of his bed and the stepsof tikhon and the doctor when they turned him over several times shelistened at the door and it seemed to her that his mutterings werelouder than usual and that they turned him over oftener she could notsleep and several times went to the door and listened wishing to enterbut not deciding to do so though he did not speak princess mary sawand knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to himshe had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look shesometimes involuntarily fixed on him she knew that her going in duringthe night at an unusual hour would irritate himbut never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losinghim she recalled all her life with him and in every word and act of hisfound an expression of his love of her occasionally amid these memoriestemptations of the devil would surge into her imagination thoughts ofhow things would be after his death and how her new liberated lifewould be ordered but she drove these thoughts away with disgust towardmorning he became quiet and she fell asleepshe woke late that sincerity which often comes with waking showed herclearly what chiefly concerned her about her fathers illness on wakingshe listened to what was going on behind the door and hearing himgroan said to herself with a sigh that things were still the samebut what could have happened what did i want i want his death shecried with a feeling of loathing for herselfshe washed dressed said her prayers and went out to the porch infront of it stood carriages without horses and things were being packedinto the vehiclesit was a warm gray morning princess mary stopped at the porch stillhorrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her thoughtsbefore going to her father the doctor came downstairs and went out toherhe is a little better today said he i was looking for you one canmake out something of what he is saying his head is clearer come inhe is asking for youprincess marys heart beat so violently at this news that she grew paleand leaned against the wall to keep from falling to see him talk tohim feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was overflowing withthose dreadful wicked temptations was a torment of joy and terrorcome said the doctorprincess mary entered her fathers room and went up to his bed he waslying on his back propped up high and his small bony hands with theirknotted purple veins were lying on the quilt his left eye gazedstraight before him his right eye was awry and his brows and lipsmotionless he seemed altogether so thin small and pathetic his faceseemed to have shriveled or melted his features had grown smallerprincess mary went up and kissed his hand his left hand pressed hers sothat she understood that he had long been waiting for her to come hetwitched her hand and his brows and lips quivered angrilyshe looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her whenshe changed her position so that his left eye could see her face hecalmed down not taking his eyes off her for some seconds then his lipsand tongue moved sounds came and he began to speak gazing timidly andimploringly at her evidently afraid that she might not understandstraining all her faculties princess mary looked at him the comicefforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and withdifficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat he said somethingrepeating the same words several times she could not understand thembut tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly repeated the wordshe utteredmmmarateate he repeated several timesit was quite impossible to understand these sounds the doctor thoughthe had guessed them and inquiringly repeated mary are you afraidthe prince shook his head again repeated the same soundsmy mind my mind aches questioned princess maryhe made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this took her hand andbegan pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to findthe right place for italways thoughts about you thoughts he then uttered much moreclearly than he had done before now that he was sure of beingunderstoodprincess mary pressed her head against his hand trying to hide her sobsand tearshe moved his hand over her hairi have been calling you all night he brought outif only i had known she said through her tears i was afraid tocome inhe pressed her handwerent you asleepno i did not sleep said princess mary shaking her headunconsciously imitating her father she now tried to express herself ashe did as much as possible by signs and her tongue too seemed to movewith difficultydear one dearest princess mary could not quite make out what hehad said but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tendercaressing word such as he had never used to her before why didnt youcome inand i was wishing for his death thought princess maryhe was silent awhilethank you daughter dear for all for all forgive thankyou forgive thank you and tears began to flow from hiseyes call andrew he said suddenly and a childish timid expressionof doubt showed itself on his face as he spokehe himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless so at least itseemed to princess maryi have a letter from him she repliedhe glanced at her with timid surprisewhere is hehes with the army father at smolenskhe closed his eyes and remained silent a long time then as if in answerto his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood andremembered everything he nodded his head and reopened his eyesyes he said softly and distinctly russia has perished theyvedestroyed herand he began to sob and again tears flowed from his eyes princess marycould no longer restrain herself and wept while she gazed at his faceagain he closed his eyes his sobs ceased he pointed to his eyes andtikhon understanding him wiped away the tearsthen he again opened his eyes and said something none of them couldunderstand for a long time till at last tikhon understood and repeatedit princess mary had sought the meaning of his words in the mood inwhich he had just been speaking she thought he was speaking of russiaor prince andrew of herself of his grandson or of his own death andso she could not guess his wordsput on your white dress i like it was what he saidhaving understood this princess mary sobbed still louder and the doctortaking her arm led her out to the veranda soothing her and trying topersuade her to prepare for her journey when she had left the room theprince again began speaking about his son about the war and about theemperor angrily twitching his brows and raising his hoarse voice andthen he had a second and final strokeprincess mary stayed on the veranda the day had cleared it was hot andsunny she could understand nothing think of nothing and feel nothingexcept passionate love for her father love such as she thought she hadnever felt till that moment she ran out sobbing into the garden and asfar as the pond along the avenues of young lime trees prince andrew hadplantedyes i i i wished for his death yes i wanted it to endquicker i wished to be at peace and what will become of me whatuse will peace be when he is no longer here princess mary murmuredpacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her hands to her bosomwhich heaved with convulsive sobswhen she had completed the tour of the garden which brought her againto the house she saw mademoiselle bouriennewho had remained atbogucharovo and did not wish to leave itcoming toward her with astranger this was the marshal of the nobility of the district who hadcome personally to point out to the princess the necessity for herprompt departure princess mary listened without understanding him sheled him to the house offered him lunch and sat down with him thenexcusing herself she went to the door of the old princes room thedoctor came out with an agitated face and said she could not entergo away princess go away go awayshe returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot of theslope by the pond where no one could see her she did not know how longshe had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a womansfootsteps running along the path she rose and saw dunyasha her maidwho was evidently looking for her and who stopped suddenly as if inalarm on seeing her mistressplease come princess the prince said dunyasha in a breakingvoiceimmediately im coming im coming replied the princess hurriedlynot giving dunyasha time to finish what she was saying and trying toavoid seeing the girl she ran toward the houseprincess its gods will you must be prepared for everything saidthe marshal meeting her at the house doorlet me alone its not true she cried angrily to himthe doctor tried to stop her she pushed him aside and ran to herfathers door why are these people with frightened faces stopping mei dont want any of them and what are they doing here she thoughtshe opened the door and the bright daylight in that previously darkenedroom startled her in the room were her nurse and other women they alldrew back from the bed making way for her he was still lying on thebed as before but the stern expression of his quiet face made princessmary stop short on the thresholdno hes not deadits impossible she told herself and approachedhim and repressing the terror that seized her she pressed her lips tohis cheek but she stepped back immediately all the force of thetenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly and wasreplaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before her no he isno more he is not but here where he was is something unfamiliar andhostile some dreadful terrifying and repellent mystery and hidingher face in her hands princess mary sank into the arms of the doctorwho held her upin the presence of tikhon and the doctor the women washed what had beenthe prince tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth shouldnot stiffen while open and with another handkerchief tied together thelegs that were already spreading apart then they dressed him in uniformwith his decorations and placed his shriveled little body on a tableheaven only knows who arranged all this and when but it all got done asif of its own accord toward night candles were burning round hiscoffin a pall was spread over it the floor was strewn with sprays ofjuniper a printed band was tucked in under his shriveled head and in acorner of the room sat a chanter reading the psalmsjust as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse so theinmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room roundthe coffinthe marshal the village elder peasant womenand all withfixed and frightened eyes crossing themselves bowed and kissed the oldprinces cold and stiffened handuntil prince andrew settled in bogucharovo its owners had always beenabsentees and its peasants were of quite a different character fromthose of bald hills they differed from them in speech dress anddisposition they were called steppe peasants the old prince used toapprove of them for their endurance at work when they came to bald hillsto help with the harvest or to dig ponds and ditches but he dislikedthem for their boorishnessprince andrews last stay at bogucharovo when he introduced hospitalsand schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay had notsoftened their disposition but had on the contrary strengthened in themthe traits of character the old prince called boorishness variousobscure rumors were always current among them at one time a rumor thatthey would all be enrolled as cossacks at another of a new religion towhich they were all to be converted then of some proclamation of thetsars and of an oath to the tsar paul in  in connection with whichit was rumored that freedom had been granted them but the landowners hadstopped it then of peter fedorovichs return to the throne in sevenyears time when everything would be made free and so simple thatthere would be no restrictions rumors of the war with bonaparte and hisinvasion were connected in their minds with the same sort of vaguenotions of antichrist the end of the world and pure freedomin the vicinity of bogucharovo were large villages belonging to thecrown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where theypleased there were very few resident landlords in the neighborhood andalso very few domestic or literate serfs and in the lives of thepeasantry of those parts the mysterious undercurrents in the life of therussian people the causes and meaning of which are so baffling tocontemporaries were more clearly and strongly noticeable than amongothers one instance which had occurred some twenty years before was amovement among the peasants to emigrate to some unknown warm rivershundreds of peasants among them the bogucharovo folk suddenly beganselling their cattle and moving in whole families toward the southeastas birds migrate to somewhere beyond the sea so these men with theirwives and children streamed to the southeast to parts where none ofthem had ever been they set off in caravans bought their freedom oneby one or ran away and drove or walked toward the warm rivers manyof them were punished some sent to siberia many died of cold andhunger on the road many returned of their own accord and the movementdied down of itself just as it had sprung up without apparent reasonbut such undercurrents still existed among the people and gathered newforces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely unexpectedly andat the same time simply naturally and forcibly now in  to anyoneliving in close touch with these people it was apparent that theseundercurrents were acting strongly and nearing an eruptionalpatych who had reached bogucharovo shortly before the old princesdeath noticed an agitation among the peasants and that contrary towhat was happening in the bald hills district where over a radius offorty miles all the peasants were moving away and leaving their villagesto be devastated by the cossacks the peasants in the steppe regionround bogucharovo were it was rumored in touch with the frenchreceived leaflets from them that passed from hand to hand and did notmigrate he learned from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasantkarp who possessed great influence in the village commune and hadrecently been away driving a government transport had returned withnews that the cossacks were destroying deserted villages but that thefrench did not harm them alpatych also knew that on the previous dayanother peasant had even brought from the village of visloukhovo whichwas occupied by the french a proclamation by a french general that noharm would be done to the inhabitants and if they remained they wouldbe paid for anything taken from them as proof of this the peasant hadbrought from visloukhovo a hundred rubles in notes he did not know thatthey were false paid to him in advance for haymore important still alpatych learned that on the morning of the veryday he gave the village elder orders to collect carts to move theprincess luggage from bogucharovo there had been a village meeting atwhich it had been decided not to move but to wait yet there was no timeto waste on the fifteenth the day of the old princes death themarshal had insisted on princess marys leaving at once as it wasbecoming dangerous he had told her that after the sixteenth he couldnot be responsible for what might happen on the evening of the day theold prince died the marshal went away promising to return next day forthe funeral but this he was unable to do for he received tidings thatthe french had unexpectedly advanced and had barely time to remove hisown family and valuables from his estatefor some thirty years bogucharovo had been managed by the village elderdron whom the old prince called by the diminutive dronushkadron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants who growbig beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged till they aresixty or seventy without a gray hair or the loss of a tooth asstraight and strong at sixty as at thirtysoon after the migration to the warm rivers in which he had takenpart like the rest dron was made village elder and overseer ofbogucharovo and had since filled that post irreproachably for twentythree years the peasants feared him more than they did their masterthe masters both the old prince and the young and the stewardrespected him and jestingly called him the minister during the wholetime of his service dron had never been drunk or ill never aftersleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the least fatigueand though he could not read he had never forgotten a single moneyaccount or the number of quarters of flour in any of the endlesscartloads he sold for the prince nor a single shock of the whole corncrop on any single acre of the bogucharovo fieldsalpatych arriving from the devastated bald hills estate sent for hisdron on the day of the princes funeral and told him to have twelvehorses got ready for the princess carriages and eighteen carts for thethings to be removed from bogucharovo though the peasants paidquitrent alpatych thought no difficulty would be made about complyingwith this order for there were two hundred and thirty households atwork in bogucharovo and the peasants were well to do but on hearing theorder dron lowered his eyes and remained silent alpatych named certainpeasants he knew from whom he told him to take the cartsdron replied that the horses of these peasants were away cartingalpatych named others but they too according to dron had no horsesavailable some horses were carting for the government others were tooweak and others had died for want of fodder it seemed that no horsescould be had even for the carriages much less for the cartingalpatych looked intently at dron and frowned just as dron was a modelvillage elder so alpatych had not managed the princes estates fortwenty years in vain he was a model steward possessing in the highestdegree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts of those he dealtwith having glanced at dron he at once understood that his answers didnot express his personal views but the general mood of the bogucharovocommune by which the elder had already been carried away but he alsoknew that dron who had acquired property and was hated by the communemust be hesitating between the two camps the masters and the serfshe noticed this hesitation in drons look and therefore frowned andmoved closer up to himnow just listen dronushka said he dont talk nonsense to me hisexcellency prince andrew himself gave me orders to move all the peopleaway and not leave them with the enemy and there is an order from thetsar about it too anyone who stays is a traitor to the tsar do youheari hear dron answered without lifting his eyesalpatych was not satisfied with this replyeh dron it will turn out badly he said shaking his headthe power is in your hands dron rejoined sadlyeh dron drop it alpatych repeated withdrawing his hand from hisbosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at drons feet i can seethrough you and three yards into the ground under you he continuedgazing at the floor in front of drondron was disconcerted glanced furtively at alpatych and again loweredhis eyesyou drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave theirhomes and go to moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow morning forthe princess things and dont go to any meeting yourself do youheardron suddenly fell on his kneesyakov alpatych discharge me take the keys from me and discharge mefor christs sakestop that cried alpatych sternly i see through you and three yardsunder you he repeated knowing that his skill in beekeeping hisknowledge of the right time to sow the oats and the fact that he hadbeen able to retain the old princes favor for twenty years had longsince gained him the reputation of being a wizard and that the power ofseeing three yards under a man is considered an attribute of wizardsdron got up and was about to say something but alpatych interruptedhimwhat is it you have got into your heads eh what are you thinkingof ehwhat am i to do with the people said dron theyre quite besidethemselves i have already told themtold them i dare say said alpatych are they drinking he askedabruptlyquite beside themselves yakov alpatych theyve fetched anotherbarrelwell then listen ill go to the police officer and you tell themso and that they must stop this and the carts must be got readyi understandalpatych did not insist further he had managed people for a long timeand knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicionthat they can possibly disobey having wrung a submissive i understandfrom dron alpatych contented himself with that though he not onlydoubted but felt almost certain that without the help of troops thecarts would not be forthcomingand so it was for when evening came no carts had been provided in thevillage outside the drink shop another meeting was being held whichdecided that the horses should be driven out into the woods and thecarts should not be provided without saying anything of this to theprincess alpatych had his own belongings taken out of the carts whichhad arrived from bald hills and had those horses got ready for theprincess carriages meanwhile he went himself to the policeauthoritiesafter her fathers funeral princess mary shut herself up in her room anddid not admit anyone a maid came to the door to say that alpatych wasasking for orders about their departure this was before his talk withdron princess mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had beenlying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to goaway and begged to be left in peacethe windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward she layon the sofa with her face to the wall fingering the buttons of theleather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion and her confusedthoughts were centered on one subjectthe irrevocability of death andher own spiritual baseness which she had not suspected but which hadshown itself during her fathers illness she wished to pray but did notdare to dared not in her present state of mind address herself to godshe lay for a long time in that positionthe sun had reached the other side of the house and its slanting raysshone into the open window lighting up the room and part of the moroccocushion at which princess mary was looking the flow of her thoughtssuddenly stopped unconsciously she sat up smoothed her hair got upand went to the window involuntarily inhaling the freshness of theclear but windy eveningyes you can well enjoy the evening now he is gone and no one willhinder you she said to herself and sinking into a chair she let herhead fall on the window sillsomeone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden andkissed her head she looked up it was mademoiselle bourienne in a blackdress and weepers she softly approached princess mary sighed kissedher and immediately began to cry the princess looked up at her alltheir former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind butshe remembered too how he had changed of late toward mademoisellebourienne and could not bear to see her thereby showing how unjust werethe reproaches princess mary had mentally addressed to her besides isit for me for me who desired his death to condemn anyone shethoughtprincess mary vividly pictured to herself the position of mademoisellebourienne whom she had of late kept at a distance but who yet wasdependent on her and living in her house she felt sorry for her andheld out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry mademoisellebourienne at once began crying again and kissed that hand speaking ofthe princess sorrow and making herself a partner in it she said heronly consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share hersorrow that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing butthis great grief that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyoneand that he from above saw her affection and gratitude the princessheard her not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her andlistening to the sound of her voiceyour position is doubly terrible dear princess said mademoisellebourienne after a pause i understand that you could not and cannotthink of yourself but with my love for you i must do so hasalpatych been to you has he spoken to you of going away she askedprincess mary did not answer she did not understand who was to go orwhere to is it possible to plan or think of anything now is it notall the same she thought and did not replyyou know chere marie said mademoiselle bourienne that we are indangerare surrounded by the french it would be dangerous to move nowif we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners and god knowsprincess mary looked at her companion without understanding what she wastalking aboutoh if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now she saidof course i would on no account wish to go away from him alpatychdid say something about going speak to him i can do nothingnothing and dont want toive spoken to him he hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrowbut i think it would now be better to stay here said mademoisellebourienne because you will agree chere marie to fall into the handsof the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terriblemademoiselle bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation notprinted on ordinary russian paper of general rameaus telling peoplenot to leave their homes and that the french authorities would affordthem proper protection she handed this to the princessi think it would be best to appeal to that general she continuedand i am sure that all due respect would be shown youprincess mary read the paper and her face began to quiver with stifledsobsfrom whom did you get this she askedthey probably recognized that i am french by my name repliedmademoiselle bourienne blushingprincess mary with the paper in her hand rose from the window and witha pale face went out of the room and into what had been prince andrewsstudydunyasha send alpatych or dronushka or somebody to me she saidand tell mademoiselle bourienne not to come to me she added hearingmademoiselle bouriennes voice we must go at once at once she saidappalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the frenchif prince andrew heard that i was in the power of the french that ithe daughter of prince nicholas bolkonski asked general rameau forprotection and accepted his favor this idea horrified her made hershudder blush and feel such a rush of anger and pride as she had neverexperienced before all that was distressing and especially all thatwas humiliating in her position rose vividly to her mind they thefrench would settle in this house m le general rameau would occupyprince andrews study and amuse himself by looking through and readinghis letters and papers mademoiselle bourienne would do the honors ofbogucharovo for him i should be given a small room as a favor thesoldiers would violate my fathers newly dug grave to steal his crossesand stars they would tell me of their victories over the russians andwould pretend to sympathize with my sorrow thought princess marynot thinking her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her fatherand her brother for herself she did not care where she remained or whathappened to her but she felt herself the representative of her deadfather and of prince andrew involuntarily she thought their thoughtsand felt their feelings what they would have said and what they wouldhave done she felt bound to say and do she went into prince andrewsstudy trying to enter completely into his ideas and considered herpositionthe demands of life which had seemed to her annihilated by her fathersdeath all at once rose before her with a new previously unknown forceand took possession of heragitated and flushed she paced the room sending now for michaelivanovich and now for tikhon or dron dunyasha the nurse and the othermaids could not say in how far mademoiselle bouriennes statement wascorrect alpatych was not at home he had gone to the police neithercould the architect michael ivanovich who on being sent for came inwith sleepy eyes tell princess mary anything with just the same smileof agreement with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed toanswer the old prince without expressing views of his own he nowreplied to princess mary so that nothing definite could be got from hisanswers the old valet tikhon with sunken emaciated face that bore thestamp of inconsolable grief replied yes princess to all princessmarys questions and hardly refrained from sobbing as he looked at herat length dron the village elder entered the room and with a deep bowto princess mary came to a halt by the doorpostprincess mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of himdronushka she said regarding as a sure friend this dronushka whoalways used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to thefair at vyazma every year and smilingly offer it to her dronushka nowsince our misfortune she began but could not go onwe are all in gods hands said he with a sighthey were silent for a whiledronushka alpatych has gone off somewhere and i have no one to turnto is it true as they tell me that i cant even go

dron what horses we had have been takenfor the army or have diedthis is such a year its not a case offeeding horseswe may die of hunger ourselves as it is some go threedays without eating weve nothing weve been ruinedprincess mary listened attentively to what he told herthe peasants are ruined they have no bread she askedtheyre dying of hunger said dron its not a case of cartingbut why didnt you tell me dronushka isnt it possible to help themill do all i canto princess mary it was strange that now at a moment when such sorrowwas filling her soul there could be rich people and poor and the richcould refrain from helping the poor she had heard vaguely that therewas such a thing as landlords corn which was sometimes given to thepeasants she also knew that neither her father nor her brother wouldrefuse to help the peasants in need she only feared to make somemistake in speaking about the distribution of the grain she wished togive she was glad such cares presented themselves enabling her withoutscruple to forget her own grief she began asking dron about thepeasants needs and what there was in bogucharovo that belonged to thelandlordbut we have grain belonging to my brother she saidthe landlords grain is all safe replied dron proudly our princedid not order it to be soldgive it to the peasants let them have all they need i give you leavein my brothers name said shedron made no answer but sighed deeplygive them that corn if there is enough of it distribute it all i givethis order in my brothers name and tell them that what is ours istheirs we do not grudge them anything tell them sodron looked intently at the princess while she was speakingdischarge me little mother for gods sake order the keys to be takenfrom me said he i have served twentythree years and have done nowrong discharge me for gods sakeprincess mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he wasasking to be discharged she replied that she had never doubted hisdevotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for thepeasantsan hour later dunyasha came to tell the princess that dron had come andall the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess order andwished to have word with their mistressbut i never told them to come said princess mary i only told dronto let them have the grainonly for gods sake princess dear have them sent away and dont goout

the peasants had come by theprincess orderbut i never sent for them declared the princess you must have givenmy message wrong i only said that you were to give them the graindron only sighed in replyif you order it they will go away said heno no ill go out to them said princess mary and in spite of thenurses and dunyashas protests she went out into the porch drondunyasha the nurse and michael ivanovich following herthey probably think i am offering them the grain to bribe them toremain here while i myself go away leaving them to the mercy of thefrench thought princess mary i will offer them monthly rations andhousing at our moscow estate i am sure andrew would do even more in myplace she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the crowdstanding on the pasture by the barnthe men crowded closer together stirred and rapidly took off theirhats princess mary lowered her eyes and tripping over her skirt cameclose up to them so many different eyes old and young were fixed onher and there were so many different faces that she could notdistinguish any of them and feeling that she must speak to them all atonce did not know how to do it but again the sense that sherepresented her father and her brother gave her courage and she boldlybegan her speechi am very glad you have come she said without raising her eyes andfeeling her heart beating quickly and violently dronushka tells methat the war has ruined you that is our common misfortune and i shallgrudge nothing to help you i am myself going away because it isdangerous here the enemy is near because i am giving youeverything my friends and i beg you to take everything all our grainso that you may not suffer want and if you have been told that i amgiving you the grain to keep you herethat is not true on thecontrary i ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate nearmoscow and i promise you i will see to it that there you shall want fornothing you shall be given food and lodgingthe princess stopped sighs were the only sound heard in the crowdi am not doing this on my own account she continued i do it in thename of my dead father who was a good master to you and of my brotherand his sonagain she paused no one broke the silenceours is a common misfortune and we will share it together all that ismine is yours she concluded scanning the faces before herall eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression she couldnot fathom whether it was curiosity devotion gratitude orapprehension and distrustbut the expression on all the faces wasidenticalwe are all very thankful for your bounty but it wont do for us totake the landlords grain said a voice at the back of the crowdbut why not asked the princessno one replied and princess mary looking round at the crowd found thatevery eye she met now was immediately droppedbut why dont you want to take it she asked againno one answeredthe silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catchsomeones eyewhy dont you speak she inquired of a very old man who stood just infront of her leaning on his stick if you think something more iswanted tell me i will do anything said she catching his eyebut as if this angered him he bent his head quite low and mutteredwhy should we agree we dont want the grainwhy should we give up everything we dont agree dont agree weare sorry for you but were not willing go away yourself alonecame from various sides of the crowdand again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expressionthough now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitudebut of angry resolvebut you cant have understood me said princess mary with a sad smilewhy dont you want to go i promise to house and feed you while herethe enemy would ruin youbut her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowdwere not willing let them ruin us we wont take your grain we dontagreeagain princess mary tried to catch someones eye but not a single eyein the crowd was turned to her evidently they were all trying to avoidher look she felt strange and awkwardoh yes an artful tale follow her into slavery pull down your housesand go into bondage i dare say ill give you grain indeed shesays voices in the crowd were heard sayingwith drooping head princess mary left the crowd and went back to thehouse having repeated her order to dron to have horses ready for herdeparture next morning she went to her room and remained alone with herown thoughtsfor a long time that night princess mary sat by the open window of herroom hearing the sound of the peasants voices that reached her from thevillage but it was not of them she was thinking she felt that shecould not understand them however much she might think about them shethought only of one thing her sorrow which after the break caused bycares for the present seemed already to belong to the past now shecould remember it and weep or prayafter sunset the wind had dropped the night was calm and fresh towardmidnight the voices began to subside a cock crowed the full moon beganto show from behind the lime trees a fresh white dewy mist began torise and stillness reigned over the village and the housepictures of the near pasther fathers illness and last momentsroseone after another to her memory with mournful pleasure she now lingeredover these images repelling with horror only the last one the pictureof his death which she felt she could not contemplate even inimagination at this still and mystic hour of night and these picturespresented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that theyseemed now present now past and now futureshe vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and wasbeing dragged along by his armpits through the garden at bald hillsmuttering something with his helpless tongue twitching his grayeyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at hereven then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died shethought he had always thought what he said then and she recalled inall its detail the night at bald hills before he had the last strokewhen with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against hiswill she had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe and goingto the door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listenedat the door in a suffering and weary voice he was saying something totikhon speaking of the crimea and its warm nights and of the empressevidently he had wanted to talk and why didnt he call me why didnthe let me be there instead of tikhon princess mary had thought andthought again now now he will never tell anyone what he had in hissoul never will that moment return for him or for me when he might havesaid all he longed to say and not tikhon but i might have heard andunderstood him why didnt i enter the room she thought perhaps hewould then have said to me what he said the day he died while talkingto tikhon he asked about me twice he wanted to see me and i wasstanding close by outside the door it was sad and painful for him totalk to tikhon who did not understand him i remember how he beganspeaking to him about lise as if she were alivehe had forgotten shewas deadand tikhon reminded him that she was no more and he shoutedfool he was greatly depressed from behind the door i heard how helay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed my god why didnti go in then what could he have done to me what could i have lost andperhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that wordto me and princess mary uttered aloud the caressing word he had saidto her on the day of his death dearest she repeated and begansobbing with tears that relieved her soul she now saw his face beforeher and not the face she had known ever since she could remember andhad always seen at a distance but the timid feeble face she had seenfor the first time quite closely with all its wrinkles and detailswhen she stooped near to his mouth to catch what he saiddearest she repeated againwhat was he thinking when he uttered that word what is he thinkingnow this question suddenly presented itself to her and in answer shesaw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay inhis coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief and thehorror that had seized her when she touched him and convinced herselfthat that was not he but something mysterious and horrible seized heragain she tried to think of something else and to pray but could doneither with wideopen eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadowsexpecting every moment to see his dead face and she felt that thesilence brooding over the house and within it held her fastdunyasha she whispered dunyasha she screamed wildly and tearingherself out of this silence she ran to the servants quarters to meether old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward heron the seventeenth of august rostov and ilyin accompanied by lavrushkawho had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly lefttheir quarters at yankovo ten miles from bogucharovo and went for arideto try a new horse ilyin had bought and to find out whether therewas any hay to be had in the villagesfor the last three days bogucharovo had lain between the two hostilearmies so that it was as easy for the russian rearguard to get to it asfor the french vanguard rostov as a careful squadron commander wishedto take such provisions as remained at bogucharovo before the frenchcould get themrostov and ilyin were in the merriest of moods on the way tobogucharovo a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where theyhoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls they questionedlavrushka about napoleon and laughed at his stories and raced oneanother to try ilyins horserostov had no idea that the village he was entering was the property ofthat very bolkonski who had been engaged to his sisterrostov and ilyin gave rein to their horses for a last race along theincline before reaching bogucharovo and rostov outstripping ilyin wasthe first to gallop into the village streetyoure first cried ilyin flushedyes always first both on the grassland and here answered rostovstroking his heated donets horseand id have won on my frenchy your excellency said lavrushka frombehind alluding to his shabby cart horse only i didnt wish tomortify youthey rode at a footpace to the barn where a large crowd of peasants wasstandingsome of the men bared their heads others stared at the new arrivalswithout doffing their caps two tall old peasants with wrinkled facesand scanty beards emerged from the tavern smiling staggering andsinging some incoherent song and approached the officersfine fellows said rostov laughing is there any hay hereand how like one another said ilyina moost merry coompa sang one of the peasants with ablissful smileone of the men came out of the crowd and went up to rostovwho do you belong to he askedthe french replied ilyin jestingly and here is napoleon himselfand he pointed to lavrushkathen you are russians the peasant asked againand is there a large force of you here said another a short mancoming upvery large answered rostov but why have you collected here headded is it a holidaythe old men have met to talk over the business of the commune repliedthe peasant moving awayat that moment on the road leading from the big house two women and aman in a white hat were seen

ilyin with a smilethe princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your namethis is count rostov squadron commander and i am your humbleservantcooompany roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as helooked at ilyin talking to the girl following dunyasha alpatychadvanced to rostov having bared his head while still at a distancemay i make bold to trouble your honor said he respectfully but witha shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a handthrust into his bosom my mistress daughter of general in chief princenicholas bolkonski who died on the fifteenth of this month findingherself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these peoplehepointed to the peasantsasks you to come up to the house wontyou please ride on a little farther said alpatych with a melancholysmile as it is not convenient in the presence of he pointed tothe two peasants who kept as close to him as horseflies to a horseah alpatych ah yakov alpatych grand forgive us for christssake eh said the peasants smiling joyfully at himrostov looked at the tipsy peasants and smiledor perhaps they amuse your honor remarked alpatych with a staid airas he pointed at the old men with his free handno theres not much to be amused at here said rostov and rode on alittle way whats the matter he askedi make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here dont wishto let the mistress leave the estate and threaten to unharness herhorses so that though everything has been packed up since morning herexcellency cannot get awayimpossible exclaimed rostovi have the honor to report to you the actual truth said alpatychrostov dismounted gave his horse to the orderly and followed alpatychto the house questioning him as to the state of affairs it appearedthat the princess offer of corn to the peasants the previous day andher talk with dron and at the meeting had actually had so bad an effectthat dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and hadnot appeared when alpatych sent for him and that in the morning whenthe princess gave orders to harness for her journey the peasants hadcome in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not lether leave the village that there was an order not to move and thatthey would unharness the horses alpatych had gone out to admonish thembut was told it was chiefly karp who did the talking dron not showinghimself in the crowd that they could not let the princess go thatthere was an order to the contrary but that if she stayed they wouldserve her as before and obey her in everythingat the moment when rostov and ilyin were galloping along the roadprincess mary despite the dissuasions of alpatych her nurse and themaids had given orders to harness and intended to start but when thecavalrymen were espied they were taken for frenchmen the coachman ranaway and the women in the house began to wailfather benefactor god has sent you exclaimed deeply moved voices asrostov passed through the anteroomprincess mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sittingroom when rostov was shown in she could not grasp who he was and whyhe had come or what was happening to her when she saw his russianface and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as aman of her own class she glanced at him with her deep radiant look andbegan speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion thismeeting immediately struck rostov as a romantic event a helpless girloverwhelmed with grief left to the mercy of coarse rioting peasantsand what a strange fate sent me here what gentleness and nobility thereare in her features and expression thought he as he looked at her andlistened to her timid storywhen she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after herfathers funeral her voice trembled she turned away and then as iffearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity looked athim with an apprehensive glance of inquiry there were tears in rostovseyes princess mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with thatradiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotteni cannot express princess how glad i am that i happened to ride hereand am able to show my readiness to serve you said rostov rising gowhen you please and i give you my word of honor that no one shall dareto cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escortand bowing respectfully as if to a lady of royal blood he moved towardthe doorrostovs deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he wouldconsider himself happy to be acquainted with her he did not wish totake advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon herprincess mary understood this and appreciated his delicacyi am very very grateful to you she said in french but i hope itwas all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it shesuddenly began to cryexcuse me she saidrostov knitting his brows left the room with another low bowwell is she pretty ah friendmy pink one is delicious her name isdunyashabut on glancing at rostovs face ilyin stopped short he saw that hishero and commander was following quite a different train of thoughtrostov glanced angrily at ilyin and without replying strode off withrapid steps to the villageill show them ill give it to them the brigands said he tohimselfalpatych at a gliding trot only just managing not to run kept up withhim with difficultywhat decision have you been pleased to come to said herostov stopped and clenching his fists suddenly and sternly turned onalpatychdecision what decision old dotard cried he what have you beenabout eh the peasants are rioting and you cant manage them youre atraitor yourself i know you ill flay you all alive and as ifafraid of wasting his store of anger he left alpatych and went rapidlyforward alpatych mastering his offended feelings kept pace withrostov at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views he said thepeasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would beimprudent to overresist them without an armed force and would it notbe better first to send for the militaryill give them armed force ill overresist them uttered rostovmeaninglessly breathless with irrational animal fury and the need tovent itwithout considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quickresolute steps toward the crowd and the nearer he drew to it the morealpatych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good resultsthe peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they sawrostovs rapid firm steps and resolute frowning faceafter the hussars had come to the village and rostov had gone to see theprincess a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowdsome of the peasants said that these new arrivals were russians andmight take it amiss that the mistress was being detained dron was ofthis opinion but as soon as he expressed it karp and others attackedtheir exelderhow many years have you been fattening on the commune karp shouted athim its all one to you youll dig up your pot of money and take itaway with you what does it matter to you whether our homes areruined or notweve been told to keep order and that no one is to leave their homesor take away a single grain and thats all about it cried anotherit was your sons turn to be conscripted but no fear you begrudgedyour lump of a son a little old man suddenly began attacking dronand so they took my vanka to be shaved for a soldier but we all haveto dieto be sure we all have to die im not against the commune saiddronthats itnot against it youve filled your bellythe two tall peasants had their say as soon as rostov followed byilyin lavrushka and alpatych came up to the crowd karp thrustinghis fingers into his belt and smiling a little walked to the frontdron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closertogetherwho is your elder here hey shouted rostov coming up to the crowdwith quick stepsthe elder what do you want with him asked karpbut before the words were well out of his mouth his cap flew off and afierce blow jerked his head to one sidecaps off traitors shouted rostov in a wrathful voice wheres theelder he cried furiouslythe elder he wants the elder dron zakharych you meek andflustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began tocome off their headswe dont riot were following the orders declared karp and at thatmoment several voices began speaking togetherits as the old men have decidedtheres too many of you givingordersarguing mutiny brigands traitors cried rostov unmeaningly in avoice not

frombehindshall i call up our men from beyond the hill he called outalpatych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to comeand bind karp the men obediently came out of the crowd and began takingoff their beltswheres the elder demanded rostov in a loud voicewith a pale and frowning face dron stepped out of the crowdare you the elder bind him lavrushka shouted rostov as if thatorder too could not possibly meet with any oppositionand in fact two more peasants began binding dron who took off his ownbelt and handed it to them as if to aid themand you all listen to me said rostov to the peasants be off to yourhouses at once and dont let one of your voices be heardwhy weve not done any harm we did it just out of foolishness itsall nonsense i said then that it was not in order voices were heardbickering with one anotherthere what did i say said alpatych coming into his own again itswrong ladsall our stupidity yakov alpatych came the answers and the crowdbegan at once to disperse through the villagethe two bound men were led off to the masters house the two drunkenpeasants followed themaye when i look at you said one of them to karphow can one talk to the masters like that what were you thinking ofyou fool added the othera real fooltwo hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of thebogucharovo house the peasants were briskly carrying out theproprietors goods and packing them on the carts and dron liberated atprincess marys wish from the cupboard where he had been confined wasstanding in the yard directing the mendont put it in so carelessly said one of the peasants a man with around smiling face taking a casket from a housemaid you know it hascost money how can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cordwhere itll get rubbed i dont like that way of doing things let itall be done properly according to rule look here put it under thebast matting and cover it with haythats the wayeh books books said another peasant bringing out prince andrewslibrary cupboards dont catch up against it its heavy ladssolidbooksyes they worked all day and didnt play remarked the tall roundfaced peasant gravely pointing with a significant wink at thedictionaries that were on the topunwilling to obtrude himself on the princess rostov did not go back tothe house but remained in the village awaiting her departure when hercarriage drove out of the house he mounted and accompanied her eightmiles from bogucharovo to where the road was occupied by our troops atthe inn at yankovo he respectfully took leave of her for the first timepermitting himself to kiss her handhow can you speak so he blushingly replied to princess marysexpressions of gratitude for her deliverance as she termed what hadoccurred any police officer would have done as much if we had hadonly peasants to fight we should not have let the enemy come so farsaid he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject i amonly happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintancegoodbye princess i wish you happiness and consolation and hope tomeet you again in happier circumstances if you dont want to make meblush please dont thank mebut the princess if she did not again thank him in words thanked himwith the whole expression of her face radiant with gratitude andtenderness she could not believe that there was nothing to thank himfor on the contrary it seemed to her certain that had he not beenthere she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of thefrench and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious dangerto save her and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty andnoble soul able to understand her position and her sorrow his kindhonest eyes with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun tocry as she spoke of her loss did not leave her memorywhen she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt hereyes filling with tears and then not for the first time the strangequestion presented itself to her did she love himon the rest of the way to moscow though the princess position was nota cheerful one dunyasha who went with her in the carriage more thanonce noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled atsomething with an expression of mingled joy and sorrowwell supposing i do love him thought princess maryashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen inlove with a man who would perhaps never love her she comforted herselfwith the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would notbe to blame if without ever speaking of it to anyone she continued tothe end of her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love forthe first and last time in her lifesometimes when she recalled his looks his sympathy and his wordshappiness did not appear impossible to her it was at those moments thatdunyasha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the carriage windowwas it not fate that brought him to bogucharovo and at that verymoment thought princess mary and that caused his sister to refuse mybrother and in all this princess mary saw the hand of providencethe impression the princess made on rostov was a very agreeable one toremember her gave him pleasure and when his comrades hearing of hisadventure at bogucharovo rallied him on having gone to look for hay andhaving picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in russia he grewangry it made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentleprincess mary who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortunehad against his will more than once entered his head for himselfpersonally nicholas could not wish for a better wife by marrying her hewould make the countess his mother happy would be able to put hisfathers affairs in order and would evenhe felt itensure princessmarys happinessbut sonya and his plighted word that was why rostov grew angry when hewas rallied about princess bolkonskayaon receiving command of the armies kutuzov remembered prince andrew andsent an order for him to report at headquartersprince andrew arrived at tsarevozaymishche on the very day and at thevery hour that kutuzov was reviewing the troops for the first time hestopped in the village at the priests house in front of which stood thecommanderinchiefs carriage and he sat down on the bench at the gateawaiting his serene highness as everyone now called kutuzov from thefield beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now theroar of many voices shouting hurrah to the new commanderinchieftwo orderlies a courier and a majordomo stood near by some ten pacesfrom prince andrew availing themselves of kutuzovs absence and of thefine weather a short swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thickmustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and glancing at princeandrew inquired whether his serene highness was putting up there andwhether he would soon be backprince andrew replied that he was not on his serene highness staff butwas himself a new arrival the lieutenant colonel turned to a smartorderly who with the peculiar contempt with which a commanderinchiefs orderly speaks to officers repliedwhat his serene highness i expect hell be here soon what do youwantthe lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at theorderlys tone dismounted gave his horse to a dispatch runner andapproached bolkonski with a slight bow bolkonski made room for him onthe bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside himyoure also waiting for the commanderinchief said he they say heweceives evewyone thank god its awful with those sausage eatersermolov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a german now pwapswussians will get a look in as it was devil only knows what washappening we kept wetweating and wetweating did you take part in thecampaign he askedi had the pleasure replied prince andrew not only of taking part inthe retreat but of losing in that retreat all i held dearnot tomention the estate and home of my birthmy father who died of grief ibelong to the province of smolenskah youre pwince bolkonski vewy glad to make your acquaintance imlieutenant colonel denisov better known as vaska said denisovpressing prince andrews hand and looking into his face with aparticularly kindly attention yes i heard said he sympatheticallyand after a short pause added yes its scythian warfare its allvewy wellonly not for those who get it in the neck so you are pwinceandwew bolkonski he swayed his head vewy pleased pwince to makeyour acquaintance he repeated again smiling sadly and he againpressed prince andrews handprince andrew knew denisov from what natasha had told him of her firstsuitor this memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to those painfulfeelings of which he had not thought lately but which still found placein his soul of late he had received so many new and very seriousimpressionssuch as the retreat from smolensk his visit to bald hillsand the recent news of his fathers deathand had experienced so manyemotions that for a long time past those memories had not entered hismind and now that they did they did not act on him with nearly theirformer strength for denisov too the memories awakened by the name ofbolkonski belonged to a distant romantic past when after supper andafter natashas singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteenwithout realizing what he was doing he smiled at the recollection ofthat time and of his love for natasha and passed at once to what nowinterested him passionately and exclusively this was a plan of campaignhe had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat he hadproposed that plan to barclay de tolly and now wished to propose it tokutuzov the plan was based on the fact that the french line ofoperation was too extended and it proposed that instead of orconcurrently with action on the front to bar the advance of the frenchwe should attack their line of communication he began explaining hisplan to prince andrewthey cant hold all that line its impossible i will undertake tobweak thwough give me five hundwed men and i will bweak the linethats certain theres only one wayguewilla warfaredenisov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan tobolkonski in the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from thearmy growing more incoherent and more diffused mingling with music andsongs and coming from the field where the review was held sounds ofhoofs and shouts were nearing the villagehes coming hes coming shouted a cossack standing at the gatebolkonski and denisov moved to the gate at which a knot of soldiers aguard of honor was standing and they saw kutuzov coming down thestreet mounted on a rather small sorrel horse a huge suite of generalsrode behind him barclay was riding almost beside him and a crowd ofofficers ran after and around them shouting hurrahhis adjutants galloped into the yard before him kutuzov was impatientlyurging on his horse which ambled smoothly under his weight and heraised his hand to his white horse guards cap with a red band and nopeak nodding his head continually when he came up to the guard ofhonor a fine set of grenadiers mostly wearing decorations who weregiving him the salute he looked at them silently and attentively fornearly a minute with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned tothe crowd of generals and officers surrounding him suddenly his faceassumed a subtle expression he shrugged his shoulders with an air ofperplexityand with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat well goodbygeneral he added and rode into the yard past prince andrew anddenisovhurrah hurrah hurrah shouted those behind himsince prince andrew had last seen him kutuzov had grown still morecorpulent flaccid and fat but the bleached eyeball the scar and thefamiliar weariness of his expression were still the same he was wearingthe white horse guards cap and a military overcoat with a whip hangingover his shoulder by a thin strap he sat heavily and swayed limply onhis brisk little horsewhew whew whew he whistled just audibly as he rode into theyard his face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man whomeans to rest after a ceremony he drew his left foot out of the stirrupand lurching with his whole body and puckering his face with theeffort raised it with difficulty onto the saddle leaned on his kneegroaned and slipped down into the arms of the cossacks and adjutantswho stood ready to assist himhe pulled himself together looked round screwing up his eyes glancedat prince andrew and evidently not recognizing him moved with hiswaddling gait to the porch whew whew whew he whistled andagain glanced at prince andrew as often occurs with old men it wasonly after some seconds that the impression produced by prince andrewsface linked itself up with kutuzovs remembrance of his personalityah how do you do my dear prince how do you do my dear boy comealong said he glancing wearily round and he stepped onto the porchwhich creaked under his weighthe unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porchand hows your fatheri received news of his death yesterday replied prince andrewabruptlykutuzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took offhis cap and crossed himselfmay the kingdom of heaven be his gods will be done to us all hesighed deeply his whole chest heaving and was silent for a while iloved him and respected him and sympathize with you with all my hearthe embraced prince andrew pressing him to his fat breast and for sometime did not let him go when he released him prince andrew saw thatkutuzovs flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes hesighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himselfcome come with me well have a talk said hebut at that moment denisov no more intimidated by his superiors than bythe enemy came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch despitethe angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him kutuzov hishands still pressed on the seat glanced at him glumly denisov havinggiven his name announced that he had to communicate to his serenehighness a matter of great importance for their countrys welfarekutuzov looked wearily at him and lifting his hands with a gesture ofannoyance folded them across his stomach repeating the words for ourcountrys welfare well what is it speak denisov blushed like a girlit was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy bibulous timeworn face and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the enemyslines of communication between smolensk and vyazma denisov came fromthose parts and knew the country well his plan seemed decidedly a goodone especially from the strength of conviction with which he spokekutuzov looked down at his own legs occasionally glancing at the doorof the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge fromit and from that hut while denisov was speaking a general with aportfolio under his arm really did appearwhat said kutuzov in the midst of denisovs explanations are youready so soonready your serene highness replied the generalkutuzov swayed his head as much as to say how is one man to deal withit all and again listened to denisovi give my word of honor as a wussian officer said denisov that ican bweak napoleons line of communicationwhat relation are you to intendant general kiril andreevich denisovasked kutuzov interrupting himhe is my uncle your sewene highnessah we were friends said kutuzov cheerfully all right all rightfriend stay here at the staff and tomorrow well have a talkwith a nod to denisov he turned away and put out his hand for the paperskonovnitsyn had brought himwould not your serene highness like to come inside said the generalon duty in a discontented voice the plans must be examined and severalpapers have to be signedan adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readinesswithin but kutuzov evidently did not wish to enter that room till hewas disengaged he made a grimaceno tell them to bring a small table out here my dear boy ill lookat them here said he dont go away he added turning to princeandrew who remained in the porch and listened to the generals reportwhile this was being given prince andrew heard the whisper of a womansvoice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door several times onglancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump rosy handsomewoman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head holding adish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commanderinchiefkutuzovs adjutant whispered to prince andrew that this was the wife ofthe priest whose home it was and that she intended to offer his serenehighness bread and salt her husband has welcomed his serene highnesswith the cross at the church and she intends to welcome him in thehouse shes very pretty added the adjutant with a smile at thosewords kutuzov looked round he was listening to the generals reportwhich consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at tsarevozaymishcheas he had listened to denisov and seven years previouslyhad listened to the discussion at the austerlitz council of war heevidently listened only because he had ears which though there was apiece of tow in one of them could not help hearing but it was evidentthat nothing the general could say would surprise or even interest himthat he knew all that would be said beforehand and heard it all onlybecause he had to as one has to listen to the chanting of a service ofprayer all that denisov had said was clever and to the point what thegeneral was saying was even more clever and to the point but it wasevident that kutuzov despised knowledge and cleverness and knew ofsomething else that would decide the mattersomething independent ofcleverness and knowledge prince andrew watched the commanderinchiefsface attentively and the only expression he could see there was one ofboredom curiosity as to the meaning of the feminine whispering behindthe door and a desire to observe propriety it was evident that kutuzovdespised cleverness and learning and even the patriotic feeling shown bydenisov but despised them not because of his own intellect feelingsor knowledgehe did not try to display any of thesebut because ofsomething else he despised them because of his old age and experienceof life the only instruction kutuzov gave of his own accord during thatreport referred to looting by the russian troops at the end of thereport the general put before him for signature a paper relating to therecovery of payment from army commanders for green oats mown down by thesoldiers when landowners lodged petitions for compensationafter hearing the matter kutuzov smacked his lips together and shookhis headinto the stove into the fire with it i tell you once for all mydear fellow said he into the fire with all such things let them cutthe crops and burn wood to their hearts content i dont order it orallow it but i dont exact compensation either one cant get onwithout it when wood is chopped the chips will fly he looked at thepaper again oh this german precision he muttered shaking his headwell thats all said kutuzov as he signed the last of the documentsand rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck hemoved toward the door with a more cheerful expressionthe priests wife flushing rosy red caught up the dish she had afterall not managed to present at the right moment though she had so longbeen preparing for it and with a low bow offered it to kutuzovhe screwed up his eyes smiled lifted her chin with his hand and saidah what a beauty thank you sweethearthe took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on thedish for her well my dear and how are we getting on he askedmoving to the door of the room assigned to him the priests wifesmiled and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the roomthe adjutant came out to the porch and asked prince andrew to lunch withhim half an hour later prince andrew was again called to kutuzov hefound him reclining in an armchair still in the same unbuttonedovercoat he had in his hand a french book which he closed as princeandrew entered marking the place with a knife prince andrew saw by thecover that it was les chevaliers du cygne by madame de genliswell sit down sit down here lets have a talk said kutuzov itssad very sad but remember my dear fellow that i am a father to youa second fatherprince andrew told kutuzov all he knew of his fathers death and whathe had seen at bald hills when he passed through itwhat what they have brought us to kutuzov suddenly cried in anagitated voice evidently picturing vividly to himself from princeandrews story the condition russia was in but give me time give metime he said with a grim look evidently not wishing to continue thisagitating conversation and added i sent for you to keep you with mei thank your serene highness but i fear i am no longer fit for thestaff replied prince andrew with a smile which kutuzov noticedkutuzov glanced inquiringly at himbut above all added prince andrew i have grown used to my regimentam fond of the officers and i fancy the men also like me i should besorry to leave the regiment if i decline the honor of being with youbelieve mea shrewd kindly yet subtly derisive expression lit up kutuzovs podgyface he cut bolkonski shorti am sorry for i need you but youre right youre right its nothere that men are needed advisers are always plentiful but men arenot the regiments would not be what they are if the wouldbe advisersserved there as you do i remember you at austerlitz i rememberyes i remember you with the standard said kutuzov and a flush ofpleasure suffused prince andrews face at this recollectiontaking his hand and drawing him downwards kutuzov offered his cheek tobe kissed and again prince andrew noticed tears in the old mans eyesthough prince andrew knew that kutuzovs tears came easily and that hewas particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to showsympathy with his loss yet this reminder of austerlitz was bothpleasant and flattering to himgo your way and god be with you i know your path is the path ofhonor he paused i missed you at bucharest but i needed someone tosend and changing the subject kutuzov began to speak of the turkishwar and the peace that had been concluded yes i have been muchblamed he said both for that war and the peace but everythingcame at the right time tout vient a point a celui qui sait attendre and there were as many advisers there as here he went on returningto the subject of advisers which evidently occupied him ah thoseadvisers said he if we had listened to them all we should not havemade peace with turkey and should not have been through with that wareverything in haste but more haste less speed kamenski would havebeen lost if he had not died he stormed fortresses with thirty thousandmen it is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult towin a campaign for that not storming and attacking but patience andtime are wanted kamenski sent soldiers to rustchuk but i only employedthese two things and took more fortresses than kamenski and made themturks eat horseflesh he swayed his head and the french shall toobelieve me he went on growing warmer and beating his chest illmake them eat horseflesh and tears again dimmed his eyes everything comes in time to him who knows how to waitbut shant we have to accept battle remarked prince andrewwe shall if everybody wants it it cant be helped but believe memy dear boy there is nothing stronger than those two patience andtime they will do it all but the advisers nentendent pas de cetteoreille voila le mal  some want a thingothers dont whats one todo he asked evidently expecting an answer well what do you want usto do he repeated and his eye shone with a deep shrewd look illtell you what to do he continued as prince andrew still did notreply i will tell you what to do and what i do dans le doute moncher he paused abstienstoi he articulated the french proverbdeliberately dont see it that way thats the trouble  when in doubt my dear fellow do nothingwell goodby my dear fellow remember that with all my heart i shareyour sorrow and that for you i am not a serene highness nor a princenor a commanderinchief but a father if you want anything comestraight to me goodbye my dear boyagain he embraced and kissed prince andrew but before the latter hadleft the room kutuzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with hisunfinished novel les chevaliers du cygne by madame de genlisprince andrew could not have explained how or why it was but after thatinterview with kutuzov he went back to his regiment reassured as to thegeneral course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had beenentrusted the more he realized the absence of all personal motive inthat old manin whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passionsand in place of an intellect grouping events and drawing conclusionsonly the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of eventsthe morereassured he was that everything would be as it should he will notbring in any plan of his own he will not devise or undertake anythingthought prince andrew but he will hear everything remembereverything and put everything in its place he will not hinder anythinguseful nor allow anything harmful he understands that there issomething stronger and more important than his own willthe inevitablecourse of events and he can see them and grasp their significance andseeing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce hispersonal wish directed to something else and above all thought princeandrew one believes in him because hes russian despite the novel bygenlis and the french proverbs and because his voice shook when hesaid what they have brought us to and had a sob in it when he saidhe would make them eat horsefleshon such feelings more or less dimly shared by all the unanimity andgeneral approval were founded with which despite court influences thepopular choice of kutuzov as commanderinchief was receivedafter the emperor had left moscow life flowed on there in its usualcourse and its course was so very usual that it was difficult toremember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor hard to believethat russia was really in danger and that the members of the englishclub were also sons of the fatherland ready to sacrifice everything forit the one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone haddisplayed during the emperors stay was the call for contributions ofmen and money a necessity that as soon as the promises had been madeassumed a legal official form and became unavoidablewith the enemys approach to moscow the moscovites view of theirsituation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even morefrivolous as always happens with people who see a great dangerapproaching at the approach of danger there are always two voices thatspeak with equal power in the human soul one very reasonably tells aman to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping itthe other still more reasonably says that it is too depressing andpainful to think of the danger since it is not in mans power toforesee everything and avert the general course of events and it istherefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes and tothink about what is pleasant in solitude a man generally listens to thefirst voice but in society to the second so it was now with theinhabitants of moscow it was long since people had been as gay inmoscow as that yearrostopchins broadsheets headed by woodcuts of a drink shop a potmanand a moscow burgher called karpushka chigirin whohaving been amilitiaman and having had rather too much at the pubheard thatnapoleon wished to come to moscow grew angry abused the french in verybad language came out of the drink shop and under the sign of theeagle began to address the assembled people were read and discussedtogether with the latest of vasili lvovich pushkins bouts rimesin the corner room at the club members gathered to read thesebroadsheets and some liked the way karpushka jeered at the frenchsaying they will swell up with russian cabbage burst with ourbuckwheat porridge and choke themselves with cabbage soup they are alldwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayforkothers did not like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar it wassaid that rostopchin had expelled all frenchmen and even all foreignersfrom moscow and that there had been some spies and agents of napoleonamong them but this was told chiefly to introduce rostopchins wittyremark on that occasion the foreigners were deported to nizhni by boatand rostopchin had said to them in french rentrez en vousmemes entrezdans la barque et nen faites pas une barque de charon  there wastalk of all the government offices having been already removed frommoscow and to this shinshins witticism was addedthat for that alonemoscow ought to be grateful to napoleon it was said that mamonovsregiment would cost him eight hundred thousand rubles and that bezukhovhad spent even more on his but that the best thing about bezukhovsaction was that he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at thehead of his regiment without charging anything for the show think it over get into the barque and take care not to make it abarque of charonyou dont spare anyone said julie drubetskaya as she collected andpressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin beringedfingersjulie was preparing to leave moscow next day and was giving a farewellsoireebezukhov est ridicule but he is so kind and goodnatured whatpleasure is there to be so caustiquea forfeit cried a young man in militia uniform whom julie called monchevalier and who was going with her to nizhniin julies set as in many other circles in moscow it had been agreedthat they would speak nothing but russian and that those who made a slipand spoke french should pay fines to the committee of voluntarycontributionsanother forfeit for a gallicism said a russian writer who waspresent what pleasure is there to be is not russianyou spare no one continued julie to the young man without heeding theauthors remarkfor caustiquei am guilty and will pay and i am prepared to pay againfor the pleasure of telling you the truth for gallicisms i wont beresponsible she remarked turning to the author i have neither themoney nor the time like prince galitsyn to engage a master to teach merussianah here he is she added quand on no no she said to themilitia officer you wont catch me speak of the sun and you see itsrays and she smiled amiably at pierre we were just talking of youshe said with the facility in lying natural to a society woman we weresaying that your regiment would be sure to be better than mamonovsoh dont talk to me of my regiment replied pierre kissing hishostess hand and taking a seat beside her i am so

petit peu amoureuse du jeunehomme  a little bit in love with the young manforfeit forfeit forfeitbut how could one say that in russianwhen pierre returned home he was handed two of rostopchins broadsheetsthat had been brought that daythe first declared that the report that count rostopchin had forbiddenpeople to leave moscow was false on the contrary he was glad thatladies and tradesmens wives were leaving the city there will be lesspanic and less gossip ran the broadsheet but i will stake my life onit that scoundrel will not enter moscow these words showed pierreclearly for the first time that the french would enter moscow thesecond broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at vyazma thatcount wittgenstein had defeated the french but that as many of theinhabitants of moscow wished to be armed weapons were ready for them atthe arsenal sabers pistols and muskets which could be had at a lowprice the tone of the proclamation was not as jocose as in the formerchigirin talks pierre pondered over these broadsheets evidently theterrible stormcloud he had desired with the whole strength of his soulbut which yet aroused involuntary horror in him was drawing nearshall i join the army and enter the service or wait he asked himselffor the hundredth time he took a pack of cards that lay on the tableand began to lay them out for a game of patienceif this patience comes out he said to himself after shuffling thecards holding them in his hand and lifting his head if it comes outit means what does it meanhe had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of theeldest princess at the door asking whether she might come inthen it will mean that i must go to the army said pierre to himselfcome in come in he added to the princessonly the eldest princess the one with the stony face and long waistwas still living in pierres house the two younger ones had bothmarriedexcuse my coming to you cousin she said in a reproachful andagitated voice you know some decision must be come to what is goingto happen everyone has left moscow and the people are rioting how isit that we are staying onon the contrary things seem satisfactory ma cousine said pierre inthe bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her always feelinguncomfortable in the role of her benefactorsatisfactory indeed very satisfactory barbara ivanovna told me todayhow our troops are distinguishing themselves it certainly does themcredit and the people too are quite mutinousthey no longer obey evenmy maid has taken to being rude at this rate they will soon beginbeating us one cant walk in the streets but above all the frenchwill be here any day now so what are we waiting for i ask just onething of you cousin she went on arrange for me to be taken topetersburg whatever i may be i cant live under bonapartes ruleoh come ma cousine where do you get your information from on thecontraryi wont submit to your napoleon others may if they please if youdont want to do thisbut i will ill give the order at oncethe princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry withmuttering to herself she sat down on a chairbut you have been misinformed said pierre everything is quiet inthe city and there is not the slightest danger see ive just beenreading he showed her the broadsheet count rostopchin writes thathe will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter moscowoh that count of yours said the princess malevolently he is ahypocrite a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot didnt hewrite in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone whoever it might beshould be dragged to the lockup by his hair how silly and honorand glory to whoever captures him he says this is what his cajoleryhas brought us to barbara ivanovna told me the mob near killed herbecause she said something in frenchoh but its so you take everything so to heart said pierre andbegan laying out his cards for patiencealthough that patience did come out pierre did not join the army butremained in deserted moscow ever in the same state of agitationirresolution and alarm yet at the same time joyfully expectingsomething terriblenext day toward evening the princess set off and pierres head stewardcame to inform him that the money needed for the equipment of hisregiment could not be found without selling one of the estates ingeneral the head steward made out to pierre that his project of raisinga regiment would ruin him pierre listened to him scarcely able torepress a smilewell then sell it said he whats to be done i cant draw backnowthe worse everything became especially his own affairs the better waspierre pleased and the more evident was it that the catastrophe heexpected was approaching hardly anyone he knew was left in town juliehad gone and so had princess mary of his intimate friends only therostovs remained but he did not go to see themto distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of vorontsovoto see the great balloon leppich was constructing to destroy the foeand a trial balloon that was to go up next day the balloon was not yetready but pierre learned that it was being constructed by the emperorsdesire the emperor had written to count rostopchin as followsas soon as leppich is ready get together a crew of reliable andintelligent men for his car and send a courier to general kutuzov to lethim know i have informed him of the matterplease impress upon leppich to be very careful where he descends for thefirst time that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemyshands it is essential for him to combine his movements with those ofthe commanderinchiefon his way home from vorontsovo as he was passing the bolotnoe placepierre seeing a large crowd round the lobnoe place stopped and got outof his trap a french cook accused of being a spy was being flogged theflogging was only just over and the executioner was releasing from theflogging bench a stout man with red whiskers in blue stockings and agreen jacket who was moaning piteously another criminal thin andpale stood near judging by their faces they were both frenchmen witha frightened and suffering look resembling that on the thin frenchmansface pierre pushed his way in through the crowdwhat is it who is it what is it for he kept askingbut the attention of the crowdofficials burghers shopkeeperspeasants and women in cloaks and in pelisseswas so eagerly centeredon what was passing in lobnoe place that no one answered him the stoutman rose frowned shrugged his shoulders and evidently trying toappear firm began to pull on his jacket without looking about him butsuddenly his lips trembled and he began to cry in the way fullbloodedgrownup men cry though angry with himself for doing so in the crowdpeople began talking loudly to stifle their feelings of pity as itseemed to pierrehes cook to some princeeh mounseer russian sauce seems to be sour to a frenchman sets histeeth on edge said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind pierrewhen the frenchman began to crythe clerk glanced round evidently hoping that his joke would beappreciated some people began to laugh others continued to watch indismay the executioner who was undressing the other manpierre choked his face puckered and he turned hastily away went backto his trap muttering something to himself as he went and took hisseat as they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times soaudibly that the coachman asked himwhat is your pleasurewhere are you going shouted pierre to the man who was driving tolubyanka streetto the governors as you ordered answered the coachmanfool idiot shouted pierre abusing his coachmana thing he rarelydid home i told you and drive faster blockhead i must get awaythis very day he murmured to himselfat the sight of the tortured frenchman and the crowd surrounding thelobnoe place pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could nolonger remain in moscow and would leave for the army that very day thatit seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that theman ought to have known it for himselfon reaching home pierre gave orders to evstafeyhis head coachman whoknew everything could do anything and was known to all moscowthat hewould leave that night for the army at mozhaysk and that his saddlehorses should be sent there this could not all be arranged that day soon evstafeys representation pierre had to put off his departure tillnext day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advanceon the twentyfourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain andafter dinner pierre left moscow when changing horses that night inperkhushkovo he learned that there had been a great battle thatevening this was the battle of shevardino he was told that there inperkhushkovo the earth trembled from the firing but nobody could answerhis questions as to who had won at dawn next day pierre was approachingmozhayskevery house in mozhaysk had soldiers quartered in it and at the hostelwhere pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to behad it was full of officerseverywhere in mozhaysk and beyond it troops were stationed or on themarch cossacks foot and horse soldiers wagons caissons and cannonwere everywhere pierre pushed forward as fast as he could and thefarther he left moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea oftroops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new andjoyful feeling he had not experienced before it was a feeling akin towhat he had felt at the sloboda palace during the emperors visitasense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificingsomething he now experienced a glad consciousness that everything thatconstitutes mens happinessthe comforts of life wealth even lifeitselfis rubbish it is pleasant to throw away compared withsomething with what pierre could not say and he did not try todetermine for whom and for what he felt such particular delight insacrificing everything he was not occupied with the question of what tosacrifice for the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new andjoyous sensationon the twentyfourth of august the battle of the shevardino redoubt wasfought on the twentyfifth not a shot was fired by either side and onthe twentysixth the battle of borodino itself took placewhy and how were the battles of shevardino and borodino given andaccepted why was the battle of borodino fought there was not the leastsense in it for either the french or the russians its immediate resultfor the russians was and was bound to be that we were brought nearerto the destruction of moscowwhich we feared more than anything in theworld and for the french its immediate result was that they werebrought nearer to the destruction of their whole armywhich they fearedmore than anything in the world what the result must be was quiteobvious and yet napoleon offered and kutuzov accepted that battleif the commanders had been guided by reason it would seem that it musthave been obvious to napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred milesand giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army hewas advancing to certain destruction and it must have been equallyclear to kutuzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of aquarter of his army he would certainly lose moscow for kutuzov this wasmathematically clear as it is that if when playing draughts i have oneman less and go on exchanging i shall certainly lose and thereforeshould not exchange when my opponent has sixteen men and i havefourteen i am only one eighth weaker than he but when i have exchangedthirteen more men he will be three times as strong as i ambefore the battle of borodino our strength in proportion to the frenchwas about as five to six but after that battle it was little more thanone to two previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred andtwenty thousand afterwards little more than fifty thousand against ahundred thousand yet the shrewd and experienced kutuzov accepted thebattle while napoleon who was said to be a commander of genius gaveit losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines ofcommunication still more if it is said that he expected to end thecampaign by occupying moscow as he had ended a previous campaign byoccupying vienna there is much evidence to the contrary napoleonshistorians themselves tell us that from smolensk onwards he wished tostop knew the danger of his extended position and knew that theoccupation of moscow would not be the end of the campaign for he hadseen at smolensk the state in which russian towns were left to him andhad not received a single reply to his repeated announcements of hiswish to negotiatein giving and accepting battle at borodino kutuzov acted involuntarilyand irrationally but later on to fit what had occurred the historiansprovided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius of thegenerals who of all the blind tools of history were the most enslavedand involuntarythe ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnishthe whole interest of the story and we are still unable to accustomourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind aremeaninglesson the other question how the battle of borodino and the precedingbattle of shevardino were fought there also exists a definite and wellknown but quite false conception all the historians describe theaffair as followsthe russian army they say in its retreat from smolensk sought out foritself the best position for a general engagement and found such aposition at borodinothe russians they say fortified this position in advance on the leftof the highroad from moscow to smolensk and almost at a right angle toit from borodino to utitsa at the very place where the battle wasfoughtin front of this position they say a fortified outpost was set up onthe shevardino mound to observe the enemy on the twentyfourth we aretold napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it and on thetwentysixth attacked the whole russian army which was in position onthe field of borodinoso the histories say and it is all quite wrong as anyone who cares tolook into the matter can easily convince himselfthe russians did not seek out the best position but on the contraryduring the retreat passed many positions better than borodino they didnot stop at any one of these positions because kutuzov did not wish tooccupy a position he had not himself chosen because the popular demandfor a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough and becausemiloradovich had not yet arrived with the militia and for many otherreasons the fact is that other positions they had passed were strongerand that the position at borodino the one where the battle was foughtfar from being strong was no more a position than any other spot onemight find in the russian empire by sticking a pin into the map athazardnot only did the russians not fortify the position on the field ofborodino to the left of and at a right angle to the highroad that isthe position on which the battle took place but never till the twentyfifth of august  did they think that a battle might be foughtthere this was shown first by the fact that there were no entrenchmentsthere by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the twentyfifth andtwentysixth were not completed and secondly by the position of theshevardino redoubt that redoubt was quite senseless in front of theposition where the battle was accepted why was it more stronglyfortified than any other post and why were all efforts exhausted andsix thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at night on thetwentyfourth a cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe theenemy thirdly as proof that the position on which the battle wasfought had not been foreseen and that the shevardino redoubt was not anadvanced post of that position we have the fact that up to the twentyfifth barclay de tolly and bagration were convinced that the shevardinoredoubt was the left flank of the position and that kutuzov himself inhis report written in hot haste after the battle speaks of theshevardino redoubt as the left flank of the position it was much laterwhen reports on the battle of borodino were written at leisure that theincorrect and extraordinary statement was invented probably to justifythe mistakes of a commanderinchief who had to be represented asinfallible that the shevardino redoubt was an advanced postwhereas inreality it was simply a fortified point on the left flankand that thebattle of borodino was fought by us on an entrenched position previouslyselected where as it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which wasalmost unentrenchedthe case was evidently this a position was selected along the riverkolochawhich crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acuteangleso that the left flank was at shevardino the right flank nearthe village of novoe and the center at borodino at the confluence ofthe rivers kolocha and voynato anyone who looks at the field of borodino without thinking of how thebattle was actually fought this position protected by the riverkolocha presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was toprevent an enemy from advancing along the smolensk road to moscownapoleon riding to valuevo on the twentyfourth did not see as thehistory books say he did the position of the russians from utitsa toborodino he could not have seen that position because it did notexist nor did he see an advanced post of the russian army but whilepursuing the russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of therussian positionat the shevardino redoubtand unexpectedly for therussians moved his army across the kolocha and the russians not havingtime to begin a general engagement withdrew their left wing from theposition they had intended to occupy and took up a new position whichhad not been foreseen and was not fortified by crossing to the otherside of the kolocha to the left of the highroad napoleon shifted thewhole forthcoming battle from right to left looking from the russianside and transferred it to the plain between utitsa semenovsk andborodinoa plain no more advantageous as a position than any otherplain in russiaand there the whole battle of the twentysixth ofaugust took placehad napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twentyfourth to thekolocha and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubtbut had begun the attack next morning no one would have doubted thatthe shevardino redoubt was the left flank of our position and thebattle would have taken place where we expected it in that case weshould probably have defended the shevardino redoubtour left flankstill more obstinately we should have attacked napoleon in the centeror on the right and the engagement would have taken place on thetwentyfifth in the position we intended and had fortified but as theattack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat ofour rear guard that is immediately after the fight at gridneva andas the russian commanders did not wish or were not in time to begin ageneral engagement then on the evening of the twentyfourth the firstand chief action of the battle of borodino was already lost on thetwentyfourth and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on thetwentysixthafter the loss of the shevardino redoubt we found ourselves on themorning of the twentyfifth without a position for our left flank andwere forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced tobenot only was the russian army on the twentysixth defended by weakunfinished entrenchments but the disadvantage of that position wasincreased by the fact that the russian commandersnot having fullyrealized what had happened namely the loss of our position on the leftflank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle fromright to leftmaintained their extended position from the village ofnovoe to utitsa and consequently had to move their forces from right toleft during the battle so it happened that throughout the whole battlethe russians opposed the entire french army launched against our leftflank with but half as many men poniatowskis action against utitsaand uvarovs on the right flank against the french were actionsdistinct from the main course of the battle so the battle of borodinodid not take place at all as in an effort to conceal our commandersmistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the russianarmy and people it has been described the battle of borodino was notfought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightlyweaker than those of the enemy but as a result of the loss of theshevardino redoubt the russians fought the battle of borodino on anopen and almost unentrenched position with forces only half as numerousas the french that is to say under conditions in which it was notmerely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisiveresult but unthinkable to keep an army even from completedisintegration and flighton the morning of the twentyfifth pierre was leaving mozhaysk at thedescent of the high steep hill down which a winding road led out of thetown past the cathedral on the right where a service was being held andthe bells were ringing pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded onfoot behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded byits singers coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying men whohad been wounded in the engagement the day before the peasant driversshouting and lashing their horses kept crossing from side to side thecarts in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying orsitting jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steepincline to make it something like a road the wounded bandaged withrags with pale cheeks compressed lips and knitted brows held on tothe sides of the carts as they were jolted against one another almostall of them stared with naive childlike curiosity at pierres white hatand green swallowtail coatpierres coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep toone side of the road the cavalry regiment as it descended the hillwith its singers surrounded pierres carriage and blocked the roadpierre stopped being pressed against the side of the cutting in whichthe road ran the sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate intothe cutting and there it was cold and damp but above pierres head wasthe bright august sunshine and the bells sounded merrily one of thecarts with wounded stopped by the side of the road close to pierre thedriver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it placed a stone under oneof its tireless hind wheels and began arranging the breechband on hislittle horseone of the wounded an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was followingthe cart on foot caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned tolook at pierrei say fellow countryman will they set us down here or take us on tomoscow he askedpierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question he waslooking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of woundednow at the cart by which he was standing in which two wounded men weresitting and one was lying one of those sitting up in the cart hadprobably been wounded in the cheek his whole head was wrapped in ragsand one cheek was swollen to the size of a babys head his nose andmouth were twisted to one side this soldier was looking at thecathedral and crossing himself another a young lad a fairhairedrecruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face lookedat pierre kindly with a fixed smile the third lay prone so that hisface was not visible the cavalry singers were passing close byah lost quite lost is my head so keen living in a foreign landthey sang their soldiers dance songas if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment themetallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays ofthe sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort ofmerriment but beneath the slope by the cart with the wounded near thepanting little nag where pierre stood it was damp somber and sadthe soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalrysingersoh the coxcombs he muttered reproachfullyits not the soldiers only but ive seen peasants today too thepeasantseven they have to go said the soldier behind the cartaddressing pierre with a sad smile no distinctions made nowadaysthey want the whole nation to fall on themin a word its moscow theywant to make an end of itin spite of the obscurity of the soldiers words pierre understood whathe wanted to say and nodded approvalthe road was clear again pierre descended the hill and drove onhe kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces but onlysaw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of differentbranches of the service who all looked with astonishment at his whitehat and green tail coathaving gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance andeagerly addressed him this was one of the head army doctors he wasdriving toward pierre in a covered gig sitting beside a young surgeonand on recognizing pierre he told the cossack who occupied the driversseat to pull upcount your excellency how come you to be here asked the doctorwell you know i wanted to seeyes yes there will be something to seepierre got out and talked to the doctor explaining his intention oftaking part in a battlethe doctor advised him to apply direct to kutuzovwhy should you be god knows where out of sight during the battle hesaid exchanging glances with his young companion anyhow his serenehighness knows you and will receive you graciously thats what you mustdothe doctor seemed tired and in a hurryyou think so ah i also wanted to ask you where our position isexactly said pierrethe position repeated the doctor well thats not my line drivepast tatarinova a lot of digging is going on there go up the hillockand youll seecan one see from there if you wouldbut the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gigi would go with you but on my honor im up to hereand he pointed tohis throat im galloping to the commander of the corps how do mattersstand you know count therell be a battle tomorrow out of an armyof a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty thousand woundedand we havent stretchers or bunks or dressers or doctors enough forsix thousand we have ten thousand carts but we need other things aswellwe must manage as best we canthe strange thought that of the thousands of men young and old who hadstared with merry surprise at his hat perhaps the very men he hadnoticed twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and deathamazed pierrethey may die tomorrow why are they thinking of anything but deathand by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the mozhaysk hillthe carts with the wounded the ringing bells the slanting rays of thesun and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mindthe cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a momentthink of what awaits them but pass by winking at the wounded yet fromamong these men twenty thousand are doomed to die and they wonder at myhat strange thought pierre continuing his way to tatarinovain front of a landowners house to the left of the road stood carriageswagons and crowds of orderlies and sentinels the commanderinchiefwas putting up there but just when pierre arrived he was not in andhardly any of the staff were therethey had gone to the church servicepierre drove on toward gorkiwhen he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street hesaw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and withcrosses on their caps who talking and laughing loudly animated andperspiring were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to theright of the roadsome of them were digging others were wheeling barrowloads of earthalong planks while others stood about doing nothingtwo officers were standing on the knoll directing the men on seeingthese peasants who were evidently still amused by the novelty of theirposition as soldiers pierre once more thought of the wounded men atmozhaysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said theywant the whole nation to fall on them the sight of these beardedpeasants at work on the battlefield with their queer clumsy boots andperspiring necks and their shirts opening from the left toward themiddle unfastened exposing their sunburned collarbones impressedpierre more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the momentthan anything he had yet seen or heardpierre stepped out of his carriage and passing the toiling militiamenascended the knoll from which according to the doctor the battlefieldcould be seenit was about eleven oclock the sun shone somewhat to the left andbehind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which rising likean amphitheater extended before him in the clear rarefied atmospherefrom above on the left bisecting that amphitheater wound the smolenskhighroad passing through a village with a white church some fivehundred paces in front of the knoll and below it this was borodinobelow the village the road crossed the river by a bridge and windingdown and up rose higher and higher to the village of valuevo visibleabout four miles away where napoleon was then stationed beyond valuevothe road disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon far in thedistance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road thecross and belfry of the kolocha monastery gleamed in the sun here andthere over the whole of that blue expanse to right and left of theforest and the road smoking campfires could be seen and indefinitemasses of troopsours and the enemys the ground to the rightalongthe course of the kolocha and moskva riverswas broken and hillybetween the hollows the villages of bezubova and zakharino showed in thedistance on the left the ground was more level there were fields ofgrain and the smoking ruins of semenovsk which had been burned downcould be seenall that pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor theright side of the field fully satisfied his expectations nowhere couldhe see the battlefield he had expected to find but only fieldsmeadows troops woods the smoke of campfires villages mounds andstreams and try as he would he could descry no military position inthis place which teemed with life nor could he even distinguish ourtroops from the enemysi must ask someone who knows he thought and addressed an officer whowas looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figuremay i ask you said pierre what village that is in frontburdino isnt it said the officer turning to his companionborodino the other corrected himthe officer evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk moved up topierreare those our men there pierre inquiredyes and there further on are the french said the officer therethey are there you can see themwhere where asked pierreone can see them with the naked eye why therethe officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the leftbeyond the river and the same stern and serious expression that pierrehad noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his faceah those are the french and over there pierre pointed to a knollon the left near which some troops could be seenthose are oursah ours and there pierre pointed to another knoll in thedistance with a big tree on it near a village that lay in a hollowwhere also some campfires were smoking and something black was visiblethats his again said the officer it was the shevardino redoubtit was ours yesterday but now it is histhen how about our positionour position replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction i cantell you quite clearly because i constructed nearly all ourentrenchments there you see theres our center at borodino justthere and he pointed to the village in front of them with the whitechurch thats where one crosses the kolocha you see down there wherethe rows of hay are lying in the hollow theres the bridge thats ourcenter our right flank is over therehe pointed sharply to the rightfar away in the broken groundthats where the moskva river is and wehave thrown up three redoubts there very strong ones the leftflank here the officer paused well you see thats difficult toexplain yesterday our left flank was there at shevardino you seewhere the oak is but now we have withdrawn our left wingnow it isover there do you see that village and the smoke thats semenovskyes there he pointed to raevskis knoll but the battle will hardlybe there his having moved his troops there is only a ruse he willprobably pass round to the right of the moskva but wherever it may bemany a man will be missing tomorrow he remarkedan elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was givingthese explanations had waited in silence for him to finish speaking butat this point evidently not liking the officers remark interruptedhimgabions must be sent for said he sternlythe officer appeared abashed as though he understood that one mightthink of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speakof itwell send number three company again the officer replied hurriedlyand you are you one of the doctorsno ive come on my own answered pierre and he went down the hillagain passing the militiamenoh those damned fellows muttered the officer who followed himholding his nose as he ran past the men at workthere they are bringing her coming there they are theyll behere in a minute voices were suddenly heard saying and officerssoldiers and militiamen began running forward along the roada church procession was coming up the hill from borodino first alongthe dusty road came the infantry in ranks bareheaded and with armsreversed from behind them came the sound of church singingsoldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past pierre toward theprocessionthey are bringing her our protectress the iberian mother of godsomeone criedthe smolensk mother of god another corrected himthe militiamen both those who had been in the village and those who hadbeen at work on the battery threw down their spades and ran to meet thechurch procession following the battalion that marched along the dustyroad came priests in their vestmentsone little old man in a hood withattendants and singers behind them soldiers and officers bore a largedarkfaced icon with an embossed metal cover this was the icon that hadbeen brought from smolensk and had since accompanied the army behindbefore and on both sides crowds of militiamen with bared heads walkedran and bowed to the groundat the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon the men who hadbeen holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved byothers the chanters relit their censers and service began the hotrays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played withthe hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the iconthe singing did not sound loud under the open sky an immense crowd ofbareheaded officers soldiers and militiamen surrounded the iconbehind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spotreserved for them a bald general with a st georges cross on his neckstood just behind the priests back and without crossing himself hewas evidently a german patiently awaited the end of the service whichhe considered it necessary to hear to the end probably to arouse thepatriotism of the russian people another general stood in a martialpose crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest whilelooking about him standing among the crowd of peasants pierrerecognized several acquaintances among these notables but did not lookat themhis whole attention was absorbed in watching the seriousexpression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who wereall gazing eagerly at the icon as soon as the tired chanters who weresinging the service for the twentieth time that day began lazily andmechanically to sing save from calamity thy servants o mother ofgod and the priest and deacon chimed in for to thee under god we allflee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection there again kindled inall those faces the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity ofthe impending moment that pierre had seen on the faces at the foot ofthe hill at mozhaysk and momentarily on many and many faces he had metthat morning and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed backand sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heardthe crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against pierresomeone a very important personage judging by the haste with which waywas made for him was approaching the iconit was kutuzov who had been riding round the position and on his wayback to tatarinova had stopped where the service was being held pierrerecognized him at once by his peculiar figure which distinguished himfrom everybody elsewith a long overcoat on his exceedingly stout roundshouldered bodywith uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of theeye he had lost kutuzov walked with plunging swaying gait into thecrowd and stopped behind the priest he crossed himself with anaccustomed movement bent till he touched the ground with his hand andbowed his white head with a deep sigh behind kutuzov was bennigsen andthe suite despite the presence of the commanderinchief who attractedthe attention of all the superior officers the militiamen and soldierscontinued their prayers without looking at himwhen the service was over kutuzov stepped up to the icon sank heavilyto his knees bowed to the ground and for a long time tried vainly torise but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight hiswhite head twitched with the effort at last he rose kissed the icon asa child does with naively pouting lips and again bowed till he touchedthe ground with his hand the other generals followed his example thenthe officers and after them with excited faces pressing on oneanother crowding panting and pushing scrambled the soldiers andmilitiamenstaggering amid the crush pierre looked about himcount peter kirilovich how did you get here said a voicepierre looked round boris drubetskoy brushing his knees with his handhe had probably soiled them when he too had knelt before the iconcame up to him smiling boris was elegantly dressed with a slightlymartial touch appropriate to a campaign he wore a long coat and likekutuzov had a whip slung across his shouldermeanwhile kutuzov had reached the village and seated himself in theshade of the nearest house on a bench which one cossack had run tofetch and another had hastily covered with a rug an immense andbrilliant suite surrounded himthe icon was carried further accompanied by the throng pierre stoppedsome thirty paces from kutuzov talking to borishe explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see thepositionthis is what you must do said boris i will do the honors of thecamp to you you will see everything best from where count bennigsenwill be i am in attendance on him you know ill mention it to himbut if you want to ride round the position come along with us we arejust going to the left flank then when we get back do spend the nightwith me and well arrange a game of cards of course you know dmitrisergeevich those are his quarters and he pointed to the third housein the village of gorkibut i should like to see the right flank they say its very strongsaid pierre i should like to start from the moskva river and rideround the whole positionwell you can do that later but the chief thing is the left flankyes yes but where is prince bolkonskis regiment can you point itout to meprince andrews we shall pass it and ill take you to himwhat about the left flank asked pierreto tell you the truth between ourselves god only knows what state ourleft flank is in said boris confidentially lowering his voice it isnot at all what count bennigsen intended he meant to fortify that knollquite differently but boris shrugged his shoulders his serenehighness would not have it or someone persuaded him you see butboris did not finish for at that moment kaysarov kutuzovs adjutantcame up to pierre ah kaysarov said boris addressing him with anunembarrassed smile i was just trying to explain our position to thecount it is amazing how his serene highness could so foresee theintentions of the frenchyou mean the left flank asked kaysarovyes exactly the left flank is now extremely strongthough kutuzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff borishad contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes he hadestablished himself with count bennigsen who like all on whom borishad been in attendance considered young prince drubetskoy an invaluablemanin the higher command there were two sharply defined parties kutuzovsparty and that of bennigsen the chief of staff boris belonged to thelatter and no one else while showing servile respect to kutuzov couldso create an impression that the old fellow was not much good and thatbennigsen managed everything now the decisive moment of battle had comewhen kutuzov would be destroyed and the power pass to bennigsen or evenif kutuzov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done bybennigsen in any case many great rewards would have to be given fortomorrows action and new men would come to the front so boris wasfull of nervous vivacity all dayafter kaysarov others whom pierre knew came up to him and he had nottime to reply to all the questions about moscow that were showered uponhim or to listen to all that was told him the faces all expressedanimation and apprehension but it seemed to pierre that the cause ofthe excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions ofpersonal success his mind however was occupied by the differentexpression he saw on other facesan expression that spoke not ofpersonal matters but of the universal questions of life and deathkutuzov noticed pierres figure and the group gathered round himcall him to me said kutuzovan adjutant told pierre of his serene highness wish and pierre wenttoward kutuzovs bench but a militiaman got there before him it wasdolokhovhow did that fellow get here asked pierrehes a creature that wriggles in anywhere was the answer he hasbeen degraded you know now he wants to bob up again hes beenproposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemys picketline at night hes a brave fellowpierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to kutuzovi concluded that if i reported to your serene highness you might sendme away or say that you knew what i was reporting but then i shouldntlose anything dolokhov was sayingyes yesbut if i were right i should be rendering a service to my fatherlandfor which i am ready to dieyes yesand should your serene highness require a man who will not spare hisskin please think of me perhaps i may prove useful to your serenehighnessyes yes kutuzov repeated his laughing eye narrowing more andmore as he looked at pierrejust then boris with his courtierlike adroitness stepped up topierres side near kutuzov and in a most natural manner without raisinghis voice said to pierre as though continuing an interruptedconversationthe militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die whatheroism countboris evidently said this to pierre in order to be overheard by hisserene highness he knew kutuzovs attention would be caught by thosewords and so it waswhat are you saying about the militia he asked borispreparing for tomorrow your serene highnessfor deaththey have puton clean shirtsah a wonderful a matchless people said kutuzov and he closed hiseyes and swayed his head a matchless people he repeated with a sighso you want to smell gunpowder he said to pierre yes its apleasant smell i have the honor to be one of your wifes adorers isshe well my quarters are at your serviceand as often happens with old people kutuzov began looking aboutabsentmindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or dothen evidently remembering what he wanted he beckoned to andrewkaysarov his adjutants brotherthose verses those verses of marins how do they go eh those hewrote about gerakov lectures for the corps inditing recite themrecite them said he evidently preparing to laughkaysarov recited kutuzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm ofthe verseswhen pierre had left kutuzov dolokhov came up to him and took his handi am very glad to meet you here count he said aloud regardless ofthe presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemntone on the eve of a day when god alone knows who of us is fated tosurvive i am glad of this opportunity to tell you that i regret themisunderstandings that occurred between us and should wish you not tohave any ill feeling for me i beg you to forgive mepierre looked at dolokhov with a smile not knowing what to say to himwith tears in his eyes dolokhov embraced pierre and kissed himboris said a few words to his general and count bennigsen turned topierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the lineit will interest you said heyes very much replied pierrehalf an hour later kutuzov left for tatarinova and bennigsen and hissuite with pierre among them set out on their ride along the linefrom gorki bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which whenthey had looked at it from the hill the officer had pointed out asbeing the center of our position and where rows of fragrant newmown haylay by the riverside they rode across that bridge into the village ofborodino and thence turned to the left passing an enormous number oftroops and guns and came to a high knoll where militiamen were diggingthis was the redoubt as yet unnamed which afterwards became known asthe raevski redoubt or the knoll battery but pierre paid no specialattention to it he did not know that it would become more memorable tohim than any other spot on the plain of borodinothey then crossed the hollow to semenovsk where the soldiers weredragging away the last logs from the huts and barns then they rodedownhill and uphill across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if byhail following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrowsof the plowed land and reached some fleches  which were still beingdug a kind of entrenchmentat the fleches bennigsen stopped and began looking at the shevardinoredoubt opposite which had been ours the day before and where severalhorsemen could be descried the officers said that either napoleon ormurat was there and they all gazed eagerly at this little group ofhorsemen pierre also looked at them trying to guess which of thescarcely discernible figures was napoleon at last those mounted menrode away from the mound and disappearedbennigsen spoke to a general who approached him and began explainingthe whole position of our troops pierre listened to him straining eachfaculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle butwas mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for thetask he could make nothing of it bennigsen stopped speaking andnoticing that pierre was listening suddenly said to himi dont think this interests youon the contrary its very interesting replied pierre not quitetruthfullyfrom the fleches they rode still farther to the left along a roadwinding through a thick lowgrowing birch wood in the middle of thewood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and scared by the tramp ofthe many horses grew so confused that it leaped along the road in frontof them for some time arousing general attention and laughter and onlywhen several voices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappearin the thicket after going through the wood for about a mile and a halfthey came out on a glade where troops of tuchkovs corps were stationedto defend the left flankhere at the extreme left flank bennigsen talked a great deal and withmuch heat and as it seemed to pierre gave orders of great militaryimportance in front of tuchkovs troops was some high ground notoccupied by troops bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake sayingthat it was madness to leave a height which commanded the country aroundunoccupied and to place troops below it some of the generals expressedthe same opinion one in particular declared with martial heat that theywere put there to be slaughtered bennigsen on his own authority orderedthe troops to occupy the high ground this disposition on the left flankincreased pierres doubt of his own capacity to understand militarymatters listening to bennigsen and the generals criticizing theposition of the troops behind the hill he quite understood them andshared their opinion but for that very reason he could not understandhow the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so grossand palpable a blunderpierre did not know that these troops were not as bennigsen supposedput there to defend the position but were in a concealed position as anambush that they should not be seen and might be able to strike anapproaching enemy unexpectedly bennigsen did not know this and movedthe troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning thematter to the commanderinchiefon that bright evening of august  prince andrew lay leaning on hiselbow in a brokendown shed in the village of knyazkovo at the furtherend of his regiments encampment through a gap in the broken wall hecould see beside the wooden fence a row of thirty yearold bircheswith their lower branches lopped off a field on which shocks of oatswere standing and some bushes near which rose the smoke of campfiresthe soldiers kitchensnarrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed tohim prince andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable ashe had done seven years before at austerlitzhe had received and given the orders for next days battle and hadnothing more to do but his thoughtsthe simplest clearest andtherefore most terrible thoughtswould give him no peace he knew thattomorrows battle would be the most terrible of all he had taken partin and for the first time in his life the possibility of deathpresented itself to himnot in relation to any worldly matter or withreference to its effect on others but simply in relation to himself tohis own soulvividly plainly terribly and almost as a certainty andfrom the height of this perception all that had previously tormented andpreoccupied him suddenly became illumined by a cold white light withoutshadows without perspective without distinction of outline all lifeappeared to him like magiclantern pictures at which he had long beengazing by artificial light through a glass now he suddenly saw thosebadly daubed pictures in clear daylight and without a glass yes yesthere they are those false images that agitated enraptured andtormented me said he to himself passing in review the principalpictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the coldwhite daylight of his clear perception of death there they are thoserudely painted figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious glorythe good of society love of a woman the fatherland itselfhowimportant these pictures appeared to me with what profound meaning theyseemed to be filled and it is all so simple pale and crude in thecold white light of this morning which i feel is dawning for me thethree great sorrows of his life held his attention in particular hislove for a woman his fathers death and the french invasion which hadoverrun half russia love that little girl who seemed to me brimmingover with mystic forces yes indeed i loved her i made romantic plansof love and happiness with her oh what a boy i was he said aloudbitterly ah me i believed in some ideal love which was to keep herfaithful to me for the whole year of my absence like the gentle dove inthe fable she was to pine apart from me but it was much simplerreally it was all very simple and horriblewhen my father built bald hills he thought the place was his his landhis air his peasants but napoleon came and swept him asideunconscious of his existence as he might brush a chip from his pathand his bald hills and his whole life fell to pieces princess mary saysit is a trial sent from above what is the trial for when he is nothere and will never return he is not here for whom then is the trialintended the fatherland the destruction of moscow and tomorrow ishall be killed perhaps not even by a frenchman but by one of our ownmen by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as one of themdid yesterday and the french will come and take me by head and heelsand fling me into a hole that i may not stink under their noses and newconditions of life will arise which will seem quite ordinary to othersand about which i shall know nothing i shall not existhe looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine with theirmotionless green and yellow foliage and white bark to die to bekilled tomorrow that i should not exist that all this should stillbe but no meand the birches with their light and shade the curly clouds the smokeof the campfires and all that was around him changed and seemedterrible and menacing a cold shiver ran down his spine he rosequickly went out of the shed and began to walk aboutafter he had returned voices were heard outside the shed whos thathe criedthe rednosed captain timokhin formerly dolokhovs squadron commanderbut now from lack of officers a battalion commander shyly entered theshed followed by an adjutant and the regimental paymasterprince andrew rose hastily listened to the business they had comeabout gave them some further instructions and was about to dismissthem when he heard a familiar lisping voice behind the sheddevil take it said the voice of a man stumbling over somethingprince andrew looked out of the shed and saw pierre who had trippedover a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen coming his way it wasunpleasant to prince andrew to meet people of his own set in generaland pierre especially for he reminded him of all the painful moments ofhis last visit to moscowyou what a surprise said he what brings you here this isunexpectedas he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldnesstheyexpressed hostility which pierre noticed at once he had approached theshed full of animation but on seeing prince andrews face he feltconstrained and ill at easei have come simply you know come it interests me saidpierre who had so often that day senselessly repeated that wordinteresting i wish to see the battleoh yes and what do the masonic brothers say about war how would theystop it said prince andrew sarcastically well and hows moscow andmy people have they reached moscow at last he asked seriouslyyes they have julie drubetskaya told me so i went to see them butmissed them they have gone to your estate near moscowthe officers were about to take leave but prince andrew apparentlyreluctant to be left alone with his friend asked them to stay and havetea seats were brought in and so was the tea the officers gazed withsurprise at pierres huge stout figure and listened to his talk ofmoscow and the position of our army round which he had ridden princeandrew remained silent and his expression was so forbidding that pierreaddressed his remarks chiefly to the goodnatured battalion commanderso you understand the whole position of our troops prince andrewinterrupted himyesthat is how do you mean said pierre not being a military mani cant say i have understood it fully but i understand the generalpositionwell then you know more than anyone else be it who it may saidprince andrewoh said pierre looking over his spectacles in perplexity at princeandrew well and what do you think of kutuzovs appointment heaskedi was very glad of his appointment thats all i know replied princeandrewand tell me your opinion of barclay de tolly in moscow they are sayingheaven knows what about him what do you think of himask them replied prince andrew indicating the officerspierre looked at timokhin with the condescendingly interrogative smilewith which everybody involuntarily addressed that officerwe see light again since his serenity has been appointed yourexcellency said timokhin timidly and continually turning to glance athis colonelwhy so asked pierrewell to mention only firewood and fodder let me inform you why whenwe were retreating from sventsyani we dare not touch a stick or a wispof hay or anything you see we were going away so he would get it allwasnt it so your excellency and again timokhin turned to the princebut we darent in our regiment two officers were courtmartialed forthat kind of thing but when his serenity took command everything becamestraight forward now we see lightthen why was it forbiddentimokhin looked about in confusion not knowing what or how to answersuch a question pierre put the same question to prince andrewwhy so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to theenemy said prince andrew with venomous irony it is very sound onecant permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops tomarauding at smolensk too he judged correctly that the french mightoutflank us as they had larger forces but he could not understandthis cried prince andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape himinvoluntarily he could not understand that there for the first timewe were fighting for russian soil and that there was a spirit in themen such as i had never seen before that we had held the french for twodays and that that success had increased our strength tenfold heordered us to retreat and all our efforts and losses went for nothinghe had no thought of betraying us he tried to do the best he could hethought out everything and that is why he is unsuitable he isunsuitable now just because he plans out everything very thoroughly andaccurately as every german has to how can i explain well say yourfather has a german valet and he is a splendid valet and satisfies yourfathers requirements better than you could then its all right to lethim serve but if your father is mortally sick youll send the valetaway and attend to your father with your own unpracticed awkward handsand will soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger couldso it has been with barclay while russia was well a foreigner couldserve her and be a splendid minister but as soon as she is in dangershe needs one of her own kin but in your club they have been making himout a traitor they slander him as a traitor and the only result willbe that afterwards ashamed of their false accusations they will makehim out a hero or a genius instead of a traitor and that will be stillmore unjust he is an honest and very punctilious germanand they say hes a skillful commander rejoined pierrei dont understand what is meant by a skillful commander repliedprince andrew ironicallya skillful commander replied pierre why one who foresees allcontingencies and foresees the adversarys intentionsbut thats impossible said prince andrew as if it were a mattersettled long agopierre looked at him in surpriseand yet they say that war is like a game of chess he remarkedyes replied prince andrew but with this little difference that inchess you may think over each move as long as you please and are notlimited for time and with this difference too that a knight is alwaysstronger than a pawn and two pawns are always stronger than one whilein war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimesweaker than a company the relative strength of bodies of troops cannever be known to anyone believe me he went on if things dependedon arrangements made by the staff i should be there makingarrangements but instead of that i have the honor to serve here in theregiment with these gentlemen and i consider that on us tomorrowsbattle will depend and not on those others success never dependsand never will depend on position or equipment or even on numbersand least of all on positionbut on what thenon the feeling that is in me and in him he pointed to timokhin andin each soldierprince andrew glanced at timokhin who looked at his commander in alarmand bewilderment in contrast to his former reticent taciturnity princeandrew now seemed excited he could apparently not refrain fromexpressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to hima battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it why did we losethe battle at austerlitz the french losses were almost equal to oursbut very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle andwe did lose it and we said so because we had nothing to fight forthere we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as we couldweve lost so let us run and we ran if we had not said that tillthe evening heaven knows what might not have happened but tomorrow weshant say it you talk about our position the left flank weak and theright flank too extended he went on thats all nonsense theresnothing of the kind but what awaits us tomorrow a hundred million mostdiverse chances which will be decided on the instant by the fact thatour men or theirs run or do not run and that this man or that man iskilled but all that is being done at present is only play the fact isthat those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only donot help matters but hinder they are only concerned with their ownpetty interestsat such a moment said pierre reproachfullyat such a moment prince andrew repeated to them it is only a momentaffording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra crossor ribbon for me tomorrow means this a russian army of a hundredthousand and a french army of a hundred thousand have met to fight andthe thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight and the sidethat fights more fiercely and spares itself least will win and if youlike i will tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those atthe top may make we shall win tomorrows battle tomorrow happen whatmay we shall winthere now your excellency thats the truth the real truth saidtimokhin who would spare himself now the soldiers in my battalionbelieve me wouldnt drink their vodka its not the day for thatthey sayall were silent the officers rose prince andrew went out of the shedwith them giving final orders to the adjutant after they had gonepierre approached prince andrew and was about to start a conversationwhen they heard the clatter of three horses hoofs on the road not farfrom the shed and looking in that direction prince andrew recognizedwolzogen and clausewitz accompanied by a cossack they rode close bycontinuing to converse and prince andrew involuntarily heard thesewordsder krieg muss in raum verlegt werden der ansicht kann ich nicht genugpreis geben  said one of them the war must be extended widely i cannot sufficiently commend thatviewoh ja said the other der zweck ist nur den feind zu schwchen sokann man gewiss nicht den verlust der privatpersonen in achtungnehmen  oh yes the only aim is to weaken the enemy so of course one cannottake into account the loss of private individualsoh no agreed the otherextend widely said prince andrew with an angry snort when they hadridden past in that extend were my father son and sister at baldhills thats all the same to him thats what i was saying to youthose german gentlemen wont win the battle tomorrow but will only makeall the mess they can because they have nothing in their german headsbut theories not worth an empty eggshell and havent in their hearts theone thing needed tomorrowthat which timokhin has they have yielded upall europe to him and have now come to teach us fine teachers andagain his voice grew shrillso you think we shall win tomorrows battle asked pierreyes yes answered prince andrew absently one thing i would do if ihad the power he began again i would not take prisoners why takeprisoners its chivalry the french have destroyed my home and are ontheir way to destroy moscow they have outraged and are outraging meevery moment they are my enemies in my opinion they are all criminalsand so thinks timokhin and the whole army they should be executedsince they are my foes they cannot be my friends whatever may have beensaid at tilsityes yes muttered pierre looking with shining eyes at prince andrewi quite agree with youthe question that had perturbed pierre on the mozhaysk hill and all thatday now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved he nowunderstood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of theimpending battle all he had seen that day all the significant andstern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing were lit up forhim by a new light he understood that latent heat as they say inphysics of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seenand this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly and asit were lightheartedlynot take prisoners prince andrew continued that by itself wouldquite change the whole war and make it less cruel as it is we haveplayed at warthats whats vile we play at magnanimity and all thatstuff such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity andsensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed sheis so kindhearted that she cant look at blood but enjoys eating thecalf served up with sauce they talk to us of the rules of war ofchivalry of flags of truce of mercy to the unfortunate and so on itsall rubbish i saw chivalry and flags of truce in  they humbuggedus and we humbugged them they plunder other peoples houses issuefalse paper money and worst of all they kill my children and my fatherand then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes take noprisoners but kill and be killed he who has come to this as i havethrough the same sufferingsprince andrew who had thought it was all the same to him whether or notmoscow was taken as smolensk had been was suddenly checked in hisspeech by an unexpected cramp in his throat he paced up and down a fewtimes in silence but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lipsquivered as he began speakingif there was none of this magnanimity in war we should go to war onlywhen it was worth while going to certain death as now then there wouldnot be war because paul ivanovich had offended michael ivanovich andwhen there was a war like this one it would be war and then thedetermination of the troops would be quite different then all thesewestphalians and hessians whom napoleon is leading would not follow himinto russia and we should not go to fight in austria and prussiawithout knowing why war is not courtesy but the most horrible thing inlife and we ought to understand that and not play at war we ought toaccept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously it all lies inthat get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game as it isnow war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous the militarycalling is the most highly honoredbut what is war what is needed for success in warfare what are thehabits of the military the aim of war is murder the methods of war arespying treachery and their encouragement the ruin of a countrysinhabitants robbing them or stealing to provision the army and fraudand falsehood termed military craft the habits of the military classare the absence of freedom that is discipline idleness ignorancecruelty debauchery and drunkenness and in spite of all this it is thehighest class respected by everyone all the kings except the chinesewear military uniforms and he who kills most people receives thehighest rewardsthey meet as we shall meet tomorrow to murder one another they killand maim tens of thousands and then have thanksgiving services forhaving killed so many people they even exaggerate the number and theyannounce a victory supposing that the more people they have killed thegreater their achievement how does god above look at them and hearthem exclaimed prince andrew in a shrill piercing voice ah myfriend it has of late become hard for me to live i see that i havebegun to understand too much and it doesnt do for man to taste of thetree of knowledge of good and evil ah well its not for long headdedhowever youre sleepy and its time for me to sleep go back togorki said prince andrew suddenlyoh no pierre replied looking at prince andrew with frightenedcompassionate eyesgo go before a battle one must have ones sleep out repeated princeandrewhe came quickly up to pierre and embraced and kissed him goodbye beoff he shouted whether we meet again or not and turning awayhurriedly he entered the shedit was already dark and pierre could not make out whether theexpression of prince andrews face was angry or tenderfor some time he stood in silence considering whether he should followhim or go away no he does not want it pierre concluded and i knowthat this is our last meeting he sighed deeply and rode back to gorkion reentering the shed prince andrew lay down on a rug but he couldnot sleephe closed his eyes one picture succeeded another in his imagination onone of them he dwelt long and joyfully he vividly recalled an eveningin petersburg natasha with animated and excited face was telling himhow she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had losther way in the big forest she incoherently described the depths of theforest her feelings and a talk with a beekeeper she met andconstantly interrupted her story to say no i cant im not tellingit right no you dont understand though he encouraged her by sayingthat he did understand and he really had understood all she wanted tosay but natasha was not satisfied with her own words she felt thatthey did not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experiencedthat day and wished to convey he was such a delightful old man and itwas so dark in the forest and he had such kind no i cantdescribe it she had said flushed and excited prince andrew smilednow the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her eyes iunderstood her he thought i not only understood her but it was justthat inner spiritual force that sincerity that frankness of soulthat very soul of hers which seemed to be fettered by her bodyit wasthat soul i loved in her loved so strongly and happily andsuddenly he remembered how his love had ended he did not need anythingof that kind he neither saw nor understood anything of the sort heonly saw in her a pretty and fresh young girl with whom he did notdeign to unite his fate and i and he is still alive and gayprince andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him and again beganpacing up and down in front of the shedon august  the eve of the battle of borodino m de beausset prefectof the french emperors palace arrived at napoleons quarters atvaluevo with colonel fabvier the former from paris and the latter frommadriddonning his court uniform m de beausset ordered a box he had broughtfor the emperor to be carried before him and entered the firstcompartment of napoleons tent where he began opening the box whileconversing with napoleons aidesdecamp who surrounded himfabvier not entering the tent remained at the entrance talking to somegenerals of his acquaintancethe emperor napoleon had not yet left his bedroom and was finishing histoilet slightly snorting and grunting he presented now his back andnow his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet was rubbinghim down another valet with his finger over the mouth of a bottle wassprinkling eau de cologne on the emperors pampered body with anexpression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much eaude cologne should be sprinkled napoleons short hair was wet and mattedon the forehead but his face though puffy and yellow expressedphysical satisfaction

yesterdays action was standing by the door afterdelivering his message awaiting permission to withdraw napoleonfrowning looked at him from under his browsno prisoners said he repeating the aidedecamps

enter and fabvier too he saidnodding to the aidedecampyes sire and the aidedecamp disappeared through the door of thetenttwo valets rapidly dressed his majesty and wearing the blue uniform ofthe guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception roomde beaussets hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the presenthe had brought from the empress on two chairs directly in front of theentrance but napoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpectedrapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surprisenapoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they werenot ready he did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving hima surprise so he pretended not to see de beausset and called fabvier tohim listening silently and with a stern frown to what fabvier told himof the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at salamanca at theother end of europe with but one thoughtto be worthy of theiremperorand but one fearto fail to please him the result of thatbattle had been deplorable napoleon made ironic remarks duringfabviers account as if he had not expected that matters could gootherwise in his absencei must make up for that in moscow said napoleon ill see youlater he added and summoned de beausset who by that time hadprepared the surprise having placed something on the chairs and coveredit with a clothde beausset bowed low with that courtly french bow which only the oldretainers of the bourbons knew how to make and approached himpresenting an envelopenapoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his earyou have hurried here i am very glad well what is paris saying heasked suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most cordialtonesire all paris regrets your absence replied de beausset as wasproperbut though napoleon knew that de beausset had to say something of thiskind and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue he waspleased to hear it from him again he honored him by touching his eari am very sorry to have made you travel so far said hesire i expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of moscowreplied de beaussetnapoleon smiled and lifting his head absentmindedly glanced to theright an aidedecamp approached with gliding steps and offered him agold snuffbox which he tookyes it has happened luckily for you he said raising the opensnuffbox to his nose you are fond of travel and in three days youwill see moscow you surely did not expect to see that asiatic capitalyou will have a pleasant journeyde beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel ofwhich he had not till then been awareha whats this asked napoleon noticing that all the courtiers werelooking at something concealed under a clothwith courtly adroitness de beausset half turned and without turning hisback to the emperor retired two steps twitching off the cloth at thesame time and saida present to your majesty from the empressit was a portrait painted in bright colors by gerard of the son borneto napoleon by the daughter of the emperor of austria the boy whom forsome reason everyone called the king of romea very pretty curlyheaded boy with a look of the christ in the sistinemadonna was depicted playing at stick and ball the ball represented theterrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepterthough it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depictingthe socalled king of rome spiking the earth with a stick the allegoryapparently seemed to napoleon as it had done to all who had seen it inparis quite clear and very pleasingthe king of rome he said pointing to the portrait with a gracefulgesture admirablewith the natural capacity of an italian for changing the expression ofhis face at will he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look ofpensive tenderness he felt that what he now said and did would behistorical and it seemed to him that it would now be best for himwhose grandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball with theterrestrial globeto show in contrast to that grandeur the simplestpaternal tenderness his eyes grew dim he moved forward glanced roundat a chair which seemed to place itself under him and sat down on itbefore the portrait at a single gesture from him everyone went out ontiptoe leaving the great man to himself and his emotionhaving sat still for a while he touchedhimself not knowing whythethick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portraitrose and recalled de beausset and the officer on duty he ordered theportrait to be carried outside his tent that the old guard stationedround it might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the king ofrome the son and heir of their adored monarchand while he was doing m de beausset the honor of breakfasting withhim they heard as napoleon had anticipated the rapturous cries of theofficers and men of the old guard who had run up to see the portraitvive lempereur vive le roi de rome vive lempereur came thoseecstatic criesafter breakfast napoleon in de beaussets presence dictated his order ofthe day to the armyshort and energetic he remarked when he had read over theproclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections itransoldiers this is the battle you have so longed for victory depends onyou it is essential for us it will give us all we need comfortablequarters and a speedy return to our country behave as you did atausterlitz friedland vitebsk and smolensk let our remotest posterityrecall your achievements this day with pride let it be said of each ofyou he was in the great battle before moscowbefore moscow repeated napoleon and inviting m de beausset who wasso fond of travel to accompany him on his ride he went out of the tentto where the horses stood saddledyour majesty is too kind replied de beausset to the invitation toaccompany the emperor he wanted to sleep did not know how to ride andwas afraid of doing sobut napoleon nodded to the traveler and de beausset had to mount whennapoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the guards before hissons portrait grew still louder napoleon frownedtake him away he said pointing with a gracefully majestic gesture tothe portrait it is too soon for him to see a field of battlede beausset closed his eyes bowed his head and sighed deeply toindicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the emperors wordson the twentyfifth of august so his historians tell us napoleon spentthe whole day on horseback inspecting the locality considering planssubmitted to him by his marshals and personally giving commands to hisgeneralsthe original line of the russian forces along the river kolocha had beendislocated by the capture of the shevardino redoubt on the twentyfourth and part of the linethe left flankhad been drawn back thatpart of the line was not entrenched and in front of it the ground wasmore open and level than elsewhere it was evident to anyone militaryor not that it was here the french should attack it would seem thatnot much consideration was needed to reach this conclusion nor anyparticular care or trouble on the part of the emperor and his marshalsnor was there any need of that special and supreme quality called geniusthat people are so apt to ascribe to napoleon yet the historians whodescribed the event later and the men who then surrounded napoleon andhe himself thought otherwisenapoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a profoundair and in silence nodded with approval or shook his head dubiouslyand without communicating to the generals around him the profound courseof ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them his finalconclusions in the form of commands having listened to a suggestionfrom davout who was now called prince deckmuhl to turn the russianleft wing napoleon said it should not be done without explaining whynot to a proposal made by general campan who was to attack thefleches to lead his division through the woods napoleon agreed thoughthe socalled duke of elchingen ney ventured to remark that a movementthrough the woods was dangerous and might disorder the divisionhaving inspected the country opposite the shevardino redoubt napoleonpondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots where twobatteries should be set up by the morrow to act against the russianentrenchments and the places where in line with them the fieldartillery should be placedafter giving these and other commands he returned to his tent and thedispositions for the battle were written down from his dictationthese dispositions of which the french historians write with enthusiasmand other historians with profound respect were as followsat dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the plainoccupied by the prince deckmuhl will open fire on the opposingbatteries of the enemyat the same time the commander of the artillery of the st corpsgeneral pernetti with thirty cannon of campans division and all thehowitzers of dessaixs and friants divisions will move forward openfire and overwhelm with shellfire the enemys battery against whichwill operate guns of the artillery of the guards  guns of campans divisionand      guns of friants and dessaixs divisions in all  gunsthe commander of the artillery of the rd corps general fouche willplace the howitzers of the rd and th corps sixteen in all on theflanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on the leftwhich will have forty guns in all directed against itgeneral sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all thehowitzers of the guards artillery against either one or other of theentrenchmentsduring the cannonade prince poniatowski is to advance through the woodon the village and turn the enemys positiongeneral campan will move through the wood to seize the firstfortificationafter the advance has begun in this manner orders will be given inaccordance with the enemys movementsthe cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the guns of theright wing are heard the sharpshooters of morands division and of thevicekings division will open a heavy fire on seeing the attackcommence on the right wingthe viceking will occupy the village and cross by its three bridgesadvancing to the same heights as morands and gibrards divisions whichunder his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come intoline with the rest of the forcesall this must be done in good order le tout se fera avec ordre etmethode as far as possible retaining troops in reservethe imperial camp near mozhayskseptember  these dispositions which are very obscure and confused if one allowsoneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his geniusrelated to napoleons orders to deal with four pointsfour differentorders not one of these was or could be carried outin the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on thespot chosen by napoleon with the guns of pernetti and fouche whichwere to come in line with them  guns in all were to open fire andshower shells on the russian fleches and redoubts this could not bedone as from the spots selected by napoleon the projectiles did notcarry to the russian works and those  guns shot into the air untilthe nearest commander contrary to napoleons instructions moved themforwardthe second order was that poniatowski moving to the village through thewood should turn the russian left flank this could not be done and wasnot done because poniatowski advancing on the village through thewood met tuchkov there barring his way and could not and did not turnthe russian positionthe third order was general campan will move through the wood to seizethe first fortification general campans division did not seize thefirst fortification but was driven back for on emerging from the woodit had to reform under grapeshot of which napoleon was unawarethe fourth order was the viceking will occupy the village borodinoand cross by its three bridges advancing to the same heights asmorands and gibrards divisions for whose movements no directions aregiven which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubtand come into line with the rest of the forcesas far as one can make out not so much from this unintelligiblesentence as from the attempts the viceking made to execute the ordersgiven him he was to advance from the left through borodino to theredoubt while the divisions of morand and gerard were to advancesimultaneously from the frontall this like the other parts of the disposition was not and could notbe executed after passing through borodino the viceking was drivenback to the kolocha and could get no farther while the divisions ofmorand and gerard did not take the redoubt but were driven back and theredoubt was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry a thingprobably unforeseen and not heard of by napoleon so not one of theorders in the disposition was or could be executed but in thedisposition it is said that after the fight has commenced in thismanner orders will be given in accordance with the enemys movementsand so it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would bemade by napoleon during the battle but this was not and could not bedone for during the whole battle napoleon was so far away that asappeared later he could not know the course of the battle and not oneof his orders during the fight could be executedmany historians say that the french did not win the battle of borodinobecause napoleon had a cold and that if he had not had a cold theorders he gave before and during the battle would have been still morefull of genius and russia would have been lost and the face of the worldhave been changed to historians who believe that russia was shaped bythe will of one manpeter the greatand that france from a republicbecame an empire and french armies went to russia at the will of onemannapoleonto say that russia remained a power because napoleon hada bad cold on the twentyfourth of august may seem logical andconvincingif it had depended on napoleons will to fight or not to fight thebattle of borodino and if this or that other arrangement depended onhis will then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his willmight have saved russia and consequently the valet who omitted to bringnapoleon his waterproof boots on the twentyfourth would have been thesavior of russia along that line of thought such a deduction isindubitable as indubitable as the deduction voltaire made in jestwithout knowing what he was jesting at when he saw that the massacreof st bartholomew was due to charles ixs stomach being deranged butto men who do not admit that russia was formed by the will of one manpeter i or that the french empire was formed and the war with russiabegun by the will of one man napoleon that argument seems not merelyuntrue and irrational but contrary to all human reality to thequestion of what causes historic events another answer presents itselfnamely that the course of human events is predetermined from on highdepends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take part in theevents and that a napoleons influence on the course of these events ispurely external and fictitiousstrange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the massacre ofst bartholomew was not due to charles ixs will though he gave theorder for it and thought it was done as a result of that order andstrange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousandmen at borodino was not due to napoleons will though he ordered thecommencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done becausehe ordered it strange as these suppositions appear yet human dignitywhich tells me that each of us is if not more at least not less a manthan the great napoleondemands the acceptance of that solution of thequestion and historic investigation abundantly confirms itat the battle of borodino napoleon shot at no one and killed no onethat was all done by the soldiers therefore it was not he who killedpeoplethe french soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of borodinonot because of napoleons orders but by their own volition the wholearmyfrench italian german polish and dutchhungry ragged andweary of the campaign felt at the sight of an army blocking their roadto moscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk had napoleon thenforbidden them to fight the russians they would have killed him andhave proceeded to fight the russians because it was inevitablewhen they heard napoleons proclamation offering them as compensationfor mutilation and death the words of posterity about their having beenin the battle before moscow they cried vive lempereur just as theyhad cried vive lempereur at the sight of the portrait of the boypiercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick and just as they wouldhave cried vive lempereur at any nonsense that might be told themthere was nothing left for them to do but cry vive lempereur and goto fight in order to get food and rest as conquerors in moscow so itwas not because of napoleons commands that they killed their fellowmenand it was not napoleon who directed the course of the battle for noneof his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know whatwas going on before him so the way in which these people killed oneanother was not decided by napoleons will but occurred independently ofhim in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who tookpart in the common action it only seemed to napoleon that it all tookplace by his will and so the question whether he had or had not a coldhas no more historic interest than the cold of the least of thetransport soldiersmoreover the assertion made by various writers that his cold was thecause of his dispositions not being as wellplanned as on formeroccasions and of his orders during the battle not being as good aspreviously is quite baseless which again shows that napoleons cold onthe twentysixth of august was unimportantthe dispositions cited above are not at all worse but are even betterthan previous dispositions by which he had won victories his pseudoorders during the battle were also no worse than formerly but much thesame as usual these dispositions and orders only seem worse thanprevious ones because the battle of borodino was the first napoleon didnot win the profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders seemvery bad and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks ofimportance when they relate to a battle that has been lost and thevery worst dispositions and orders seem very good and serious peoplefill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits when they relate to abattle that has been wonthe dispositions drawn up by weyrother for the battle of austerlitz werea model of perfection for that kind of composition but still they werecriticizedcriticized for their very perfection for their excessiveminutenessnapoleon at the battle of borodino fulfilled his office asrepresentative of authority as well as and even better than at otherbattles he did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle heinclined to the most reasonable opinions he made no confusion did notcontradict himself did not get frightened or run away from the field ofbattle but with his great tact and military experience carried out hisrole of appearing to command calmly and with dignityon returning from a second inspection of the lines napoleon remarkedthe chessmen are set up the game will begin tomorrowhaving ordered punch and summoned de beausset he began to talk to himabout paris and about some changes he meant to make in the empresshousehold surprising the prefect by his memory of minute detailsrelating to the courthe showed an interest in trifles joked about de beaussets love oftravel and chatted carelessly as a famous selfconfident surgeon whoknows his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on his apronwhile a patient is being strapped to the operating table the matter isin my hands and is clear and definite in my head when the time comes toset to work i shall do it as no one else could but now i can jest andthe more i jest and the calmer i am the more tranquil and confident youought to be and the more amazed at my geniushaving finished his second glass of punch napoleon went to rest beforethe serious business which he considered awaited him next day he wasso much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep and inspite of his cold which had grown worse from the dampness of theevening he went into the large division of the tent at three oclock inthe morning loudly blowing his nose he asked whether the russians hadnot withdrawn and was told that the enemys fires were still in thesame places he nodded approvalthe adjutant in attendance came into the tentwell rapp do you think we shall do good business today napoleonasked himwithout doubt sire replied rappnapoleon looked at himdo you remember sire what you did

diminished greatly sincesmolensk fortune is frankly a courtesan rapp i have always said soand i am beginning to experience it but the guards rapp the guardsare intact he remarked interrogativelyyes sire replied rappnapoleon took a lozenge put it in his mouth and glanced at his watchhe was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning it was impossibleto give further orders for the sake of killing time for the orders hadall been given and were now being executedhave the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of theguards asked napoleon sternlyyes sirethe rice toorapp replied that he had given the emperors order about the rice butnapoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing that hisorder had been executed an attendant came in with punch napoleonordered another glass to be brought for rapp and silently sipped hisowni have neither taste nor smell he remarked sniffing at his glassthis cold is tiresome they talk about medicinewhat is the good ofmedicine

thewatchmaker cannot open it he can only adjust it by fumbling and thatblindfold yes our body is just a machine for living that is alland having entered on the path of definition of which he was fondnapoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new onedo you know rapp what military art is asked he it is the art ofbeing stronger than the enemy at a given moment thats allrapp made no replytomorrow we shall have to deal with kutuzov said napoleon we shallsee do you remember at braunau he commanded an army for three weeks anddid not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments we shallseehe looked at his watch it was still only four oclock he did not feelsleepy the punch was finished and there was still nothing to do herose walked to and fro put on a warm overcoat and a hat and went outof the tent the night was dark and damp a scarcely perceptiblemoisture was descending from above near by the campfires were dimlyburning among the french guards and in the distance those of therussian line shone through the smoke the weather was calm and therustle and tramp of the french troops already beginning to move to takeup their positions were clearly audiblenapoleon walked about in front of his tent looked at the fires andlistened to these sounds and as he was passing a tall guardsman in ashaggy cap who was standing sentinel before his tent and had drawnhimself up like a black pillar at sight of the emperor napoleon stoppedin front of himwhat year did you enter the service he asked with that affectation ofmilitary bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed thesoldiersthe man answered the questionah one of the old ones has your regiment had its riceit has your majestynapoleon nodded and walked awayat halfpast five napoleon rode to the village of shevardinoit was growing light the sky was clearing only a single cloud lay inthe east the abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in thefaint morning lighton the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died away inthe prevailing silence some minutes passed a second and a third reportshook the air then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on therightthe first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang outand yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one anothernapoleon with his suite rode up to the shevardino redoubt where hedismounted the game had begunon returning to gorki after having seen prince andrew pierre orderedhis groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the morningand then immediately fell asleep behind a partition in a corner borishad given up to himbefore he was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had already leftthe hut the panes were rattling in the little windows and his groom wasshaking himyour excellency your excellency your excellency he kept repeatingpertinaciously while he shook pierre by the shoulder without looking athim having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake upwhat has it begun is it time pierre asked waking uphear the firing said the groom a discharged soldier all thegentlemen have gone out and his serene highness himself rode past longagopierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch outside all was brightfresh dewy and cheerful the sun just bursting forth from behind acloud that had concealed it was shining with rays still half broken bythe clouds over the roofs of the street opposite on the dewbesprinkled dust of the road on the walls of the houses on thewindows the fence and on pierres horses standing before the hut theroar of guns sounded more distinct outside an adjutant accompanied by acossack passed by at a sharp trotits time count its time cried the adjutanttelling the groom to follow him with the horses pierre went down thestreet to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of battle theday before a crowd of military men was assembled there members of thestaff could be heard conversing in french and kutuzovs gray head in awhite cap with a red band was visible his gray nape sunk between hisshoulders he was looking through a field glass down the highroad beforehimmounting the steps to the knoll pierre looked at the scene before himspellbound by beauty it was the same panorama he had admired from thatspot the day before but now the whole place was full of troops andcovered by smoke clouds from the guns and the slanting rays of thebright sun rising slightly to the left behind pierre cast upon itthrough the clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy goldentintedlight and long dark shadows the forest at the farthest extremity of thepanorama seemed carved in some precious stone of a yellowishgreencolor its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon andwas pierced beyond valuevo by the smolensk highroad crowded with troopsnearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copsesthere were troops to be seen everywhere in front and to the right andleft all this was vivid majestic and unexpected but what impressedpierre most of all was the view of the battlefield itself of borodinoand the hollows on both sides of the kolochaabove the kolocha in borodino and on both sides of it especially tothe left where the voyna flowing between its marshy banks falls into thekolocha a mist had spread which seemed to melt to dissolve and tobecome translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically coloredand outlined everything the smoke of the guns mingled with this mistand over the whole expanse and through that mist the rays of the morningsun were reflected flashing back like lightning from the water fromthe dew and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by theriverbanks and in borodino a white church could be seen through themist and here and there the roofs of huts in borodino as well as densemasses of soldiers or green ammunition chests and ordnance and allthis moved or seemed to move as the smoke and mist spread out over thewhole space just as in the mistenveloped hollow near borodino soalong the entire line outside and above it and especially in the woodsand fields to the left in the valleys and on the summits of the highground clouds of powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out ofnothing now singly now several at a time some translucent othersdense which swelling growing rolling and blending extended overthe whole expansethese puffs of smoke and strange to say the sound of the firingproduced the chief beauty of the spectaclepuffsuddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging fromviolet into gray and milky white and boom came the report a secondlaterpuff puffand two clouds arose pushing one another and blendingtogether and boom boom came the sounds confirming what the eye hadseenpierre glanced round at the first cloud which he had seen as a roundcompact ball and in its place already were balloons of smoke floatingto one side andpuff with a pausepuff puff three and thenfour more appeared and then from each with the same intervalboomboom boom came the fine firm precise sounds in reply it seemed asif those smoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes stood still whilewoods fields and glittering bayonets ran past them from the leftover fields and bushes those large balls of smoke were continuallyappearing followed by their solemn reports while nearer still in thehollows and woods there burst from the muskets small cloudlets that hadno time to become balls but had their little echoes in just the sameway trakhtatatakh came the frequent crackle of musketry but itwas irregular and feeble in comparison with the reports of the cannonpierre wished to be there with that smoke those shining bayonets thatmovement and those sounds he turned to look at kutuzov and his suiteto compare his impressions with those of others they were all lookingat the field of battle as he was and as it seemed to him with thesame feelings all their faces were now shining with that latent warmthof feeling pierre had noticed the day before and had fully understoodafter his talk with prince andrewgo my dear fellow go and christ be with you kutuzov was sayingto a general who stood beside him not taking his eye from thebattlefieldhaving received this order the general passed by pierre on his way downthe knollto the crossing said the general coldly and sternly in reply to oneof the staff who asked where he was goingill go there too i too thought pierre and followed the generalthe general mounted a horse a cossack had brought him pierre went tohis groom who was holding his horses and asking which was the quietestclambered onto it seized it by the mane and turning out his toespressed his heels against its sides and feeling that his spectacleswere slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and reins hegalloped after the general causing the staff officers to smile as theywatched him from the knollhaving descended the hill the general after whom pierre was gallopingturned sharply to the left and pierre losing sight of him galloped inamong some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him he tried to passeither in front of them or to the right or left but there were soldierseverywhere all with the same preoccupied expression and busy with someunseen but evidently important task they all gazed with the samedissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white hatwho for some unknown reason threatened to trample them under his horseshoofswhy ride into the middle of the battalion one of them shouted at himanother prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket and pierrebending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horsegalloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free spacethere was a bridge ahead of him where other soldiers stood firingpierre rode up to them without being aware of it he had come to thebridge across the kolocha between gorki and borodino which the frenchhaving occupied borodino were attacking in the first phase of thebattle pierre saw that there was a bridge in front of him and thatsoldiers were doing something on both sides of it and in the meadowamong the rows of newmown hay which he had taken no notice of amid thesmoke of the campfires the day before but despite the incessant firinggoing on there he had no idea that this was the field of battle he didnot notice the sound of the bullets whistling from every side or theprojectiles that flew over him did not see the enemy on the other sideof the river and for a long time did not notice the killed and woundedthough many fell near him he looked about him with a smile which didnot leave his facewhys that fellow in front of the line shouted somebody at him againto the left keep to the right the men shouted to himpierre went to the right and unexpectedly encountered one of raevskisadjutants whom he knew the adjutant looked angrily at him evidentlyalso intending to shout at him but on recognizing him he noddedhow have you got here he said and galloped onpierre feeling out of place there having nothing to do and afraid ofgetting in someones way again galloped after the adjutantwhats happening here may i come with you he askedone moment one moment replied the adjutant and riding up to a stoutcolonel who was standing in the meadow he gave him some message andthen addressed pierrewhy have you come here count he asked with a smile stillinquisitiveyes yes assented pierrebut the adjutant turned his horse about and rode onhere its tolerable said he but with bagration on the left flanktheyre getting it frightfully hotreally said pierre where is thatcome along with me to our knoll we can get a view from there and inour battery it is still bearable said the adjutant will you comeyes ill come with you replied pierre looking round for his groomit was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or beingcarried on stretchers on that very meadow he had ridden over the daybefore a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay with hishead thrown awkwardly back and his shako offwhy havent they carried him away pierre was about to ask but seeingthe stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way hechecked himselfpierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with theadjutant to raevskis redoubt his horse lagged behind the adjutantsand jolted him at every stepyou dont seem to be used to riding count remarked the adjutantno its not that but her action seems so jerky said pierre in apuzzled tonewhy shes wounded said the adjutant in the off foreleg above theknee a bullet no doubt i congratulate you count on your baptism offirehaving ridden in the smoke past the sixth corps behind the artillerywhich had been moved forward and was in action deafening them with thenoise of firing they came to a small wood there it was cool and quietwith a scent of autumn pierre and the adjutant dismounted and walked upthe hill on footis the general here asked the adjutant on reaching the knollhe was here a minute ago but has just gone that way someone told himpointing to the rightthe adjutant looked at pierre as if puzzled what to do with him nowdont trouble about me said pierre ill go up onto the knoll if imayyes do youll see everything from there and its less dangerous andill come for youpierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on they did not meetagain and only much later did pierre learn that he lost an arm thatdaythe knoll to which pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards knownto the russians as the knoll battery or raevskis redoubt and to thefrench as la grande redoute la fatale redoute la redoute du centrearound which tens of thousands fell and which the french regarded asthe key to the whole positionthis redoubt consisted of a knoll on three sides of which trenches hadbeen dug within the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being firedthrough openings in the earthworkin line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also firedincessantly a little behind the guns stood infantry when ascendingthat knoll pierre had no notion that this spot on which small trencheshad been dug and from which a few guns were firing was the mostimportant point of the battleon the contrary just because he happened to be there he thought it oneof the least significant parts of the fieldhaving reached the knoll pierre sat down at one end of a trenchsurrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him withan unconsciously happy smile occasionally he rose and walked about thebattery still with that same smile trying not to obstruct the soldierswho were loading hauling the guns and continually running past himwith bags and charges the guns of that battery were being firedcontinually one after another with a deafening roar enveloping thewhole neighborhood in powder smokein contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in supporthere in the battery where a small number of men busy at their work wereseparated from the rest by a trench everyone experienced a common andas it were family feeling of animationthe intrusion of pierres nonmilitary figure in a white hat made anunpleasant impression at first the soldiers looked askance at him withsurprise and even alarm as they went past him the senior artilleryofficer a tall longlegged pockmarked man moved over to pierre as ifto see the action of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiositya young roundfaced officer quite a boy still and evidently only justout of the cadet college who was zealously commanding the two gunsentrusted to him addressed pierre sternlysir he said permit me to ask you to stand aside you must not beherethe soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at pierrebut when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hatwas doing no harm but either sat quietly on the slope of the trenchwith a shy smile or politely making way for the soldiers paced up anddown the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevardtheir feeling of hostile distrust gradually began to change into akindly and bantering sympathy such as soldiers feel for their dogscocks goats and in general for the animals that live with theregiment the men soon accepted pierre into their family adopted himgave him a nickname our gentleman and made kindly fun of him amongthemselvesa shell tore up the earth two paces from pierre and he looked aroundwith a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown upand hows it youre not afraid sir really now a redfaced broadshouldered soldier asked pierre with a grin that disclosed a set ofsound white teethare you afraid then said pierrewhat else do you expect answered the soldier she has no mercy youknow when she comes spluttering down out go your innards one canthelp being afraid he said laughingseveral of the men with bright kindly faces stopped beside pierrethey seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else and thediscovery that he did so delighted themits the business of us soldiers but in a gentleman its wonderfultheres a gentleman for youto your places cried the young officer to the men gathered roundpierrethe young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first orsecond time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men withgreat precision and formalitythe booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing moreintense over the whole field especially to the left where bagrationsfleches were but where pierre was the smoke of the firing made italmost impossible to distinguish anything moreover his whole attentionwas engrossed by watching the family circleseparated from all elseformed by the men in the battery his first unconscious feeling ofjoyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefieldwas now replaced by another especially since he had seen that soldierlying alone in the hayfield now seated on the slope of the trench heobserved the faces of those around himby ten oclock some twenty men had already been carried away from thebattery two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and morefrequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled aroundbut the men in the battery seemed not to notice this and merry voicesand jokes were heard on all sidesa live one shouted a man as a whistling shell approachednot this way to the infantry added another with loud laughterseeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supportsare you bowing to a friend eh remarked another chaffing a peasantwho ducked low as a cannon ball flew overseveral soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench looking out to seewhat was happening in fronttheyve withdrawn the front line it has retired said they pointingover the earthworkmind your own business an old sergeant shouted at them if theyveretired its because theres work for them to do farther backand the sergeant taking one of the men by the shoulders gave him ashove with his knee this was followed by a burst of laughterto the fifth gun wheel it up came shouts from one sidenow then all together like bargees rose the merry voices of thosewho were moving the gunoh she nearly knocked our gentlemans hat off cried the redfacedhumorist showing his teeth chaffing pierre awkward baggage he addedreproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a manslegnow then you foxes said another laughing at some militiamen whostooping low entered the battery to carry away the wounded manso this gruel isnt to your taste oh you crows youre scared theyshouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man whose leghad been torn offthere lads oh oh they mimicked the peasants they dont like itat allpierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt and afterevery loss the liveliness increased more and moreas the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly andrapidly from an approaching thundercloud so as if in opposition towhat was taking place the lightning of hidden fire growing more andmore intense glowed in the faces of these menpierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to knowwhat was happening there he was entirely absorbed in watching this firewhich burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in thesame way in his own soulat ten oclock the infantry that had been among the bushes in front ofthe battery and along the kamenka streamlet retreated from the batterythey could be seen running back past it carrying their wounded on theirmuskets a general with his suite came to the battery and afterspeaking to the colonel gave pierre an angry look and went away againhaving ordered the infantry supports behind the battery to lie down soas to be less exposed to fire after this from amid the ranks ofinfantry to the right of the battery came the sound of a drum and shoutsof command and from the battery one saw how those ranks of infantrymoved forwardpierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly struck bya pale young officer who letting his sword hang down was walkingbackwards and kept glancing uneasily aroundthe ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their longdrawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard a fewminutes later crowds of wounded men and stretcherbearers came back fromthat direction projectiles began to fall still more frequently in thebattery several men were lying about who had not been removed aroundthe cannon the men moved still more briskly and busily no one anylonger took notice of pierre once or twice he was shouted at for beingin the way the senior officer moved with big rapid strides from onegun to another with a frowning face the young officer with his facestill more flushed commanded the men more scrupulously than ever thesoldiers handed up the charges turned loaded and did their businesswith strained smartness they gave little jumps as they walked asthough they were on springsthe stormcloud had come upon them and in every face the fire whichpierre had watched kindle burned up brightly pierre standing beside thecommanding officer the young officer his hand to his shako ran up tohis superiori have the honor to report sir that only eight rounds are left arewe to continue firing he askedgrapeshot the senior shouted without answering the question lookingover the wall of the trenchsuddenly something happened the young officer gave a gasp and bendingdouble sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing everythingbecame strange confused and misty in pierres eyesone cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork asoldier or a gun pierre who had not noticed these sounds before nowheard nothing else on the right of the battery soldiers shoutinghurrah were running not forwards but backwards it seemed to pierrea cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he wasstanding crumbling down the earth a black ball flashed before his eyesand at the same instant plumped into something some militiamen who wereentering the battery ran backall with grapeshot shouted the officerthe sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informedhim as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more ofsome wine asked for that there were no more chargesthe scoundrels what are they doing shouted the officer turning topierrethe officers face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered underhis frowning browrun to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes he yelledangrily avoiding pierre with his eyes and speaking to his menill go said pierrethe officer without answering him strode across to the opposite sidedont fire wait he shoutedthe man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled againstpierreeh sir this is no place for you said he and ran down the slopepierre ran after him avoiding the spot where the young officer wassittingone cannon ball another and a third flew over him falling in frontbeside and behind him pierre ran down the slope where am i goinghe suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green ammunitionwagons he halted irresolutely not knowing whether to return or go onsuddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground at thesame instant he was dazzled by a great flash of flame and immediately adeafening roar crackling and whistling made his ears tinglewhen he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on hishands the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existedonly charred green boards and rags littered the scorched grass and ahorse dangling fragments of its shaft behind it galloped past whileanother horse lay like pierre on the ground uttering prolonged andpiercing criesbeside himself with terror pierre jumped up and ran back to the batteryas to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded himon entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing somethingthere but that no shots were being fired from the battery he had notime to realize who these men were he saw the senior officer lying onthe earth wall with his back turned as if he were examining somethingdown below and that one of the soldiers he had noticed before wasstruggling forward shouting brothers and trying to free himself fromsome men who were holding him by the arm he also saw something elsethat was strangebut he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed thatthe soldier shouting brothers was a prisoner and that another manhad been bayoneted in the back before his eyes for hardly had he runinto the redoubt before a thin sallowfaced perspiring man in a blueuniform rushed on him sword in hand shouting something instinctivelyguarding against the shockfor they had been running together at fullspeed before they saw one anotherpierre put out his hands and seizedthe man a french officer by the shoulder with one hand and by thethroat with the other the officer dropping his sword seized pierre byhis collarfor some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one anothersunfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and whatthey were to do next am i taken prisoner or have i taken himprisoner each was thinking but the french officer was evidently moreinclined to think he had been taken prisoner because pierres stronghand impelled by instinctive fear squeezed his throat ever tighter andtighter the frenchman was about to say something when just above theirheads terrible and low a cannon ball whistled and it seemed to pierrethat the french officers head had been torn off so swiftly had heducked itpierre too bent his head and let his hands fall without further thoughtas to who had taken whom prisoner the frenchman ran back to the batteryand pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead and wounded whoit seemed to him caught at his feet but before he reached the foot ofthe knoll he was met by a dense crowd of russian soldiers whostumbling tripping up and shouting ran merrily and wildly toward thebattery this was the attack for which ermolov claimed the creditdeclaring that only his courage and good luck made such a feat possibleit was the attack in which he was said to have thrown some st georgescrosses he had in his pocket into the battery for the first soldiers totake who got therethe french who had occupied the battery fled and our troops shoutinghurrah pursued them so far beyond the battery that it was difficultto call them backthe prisoners were brought down from the battery and among them was awounded french general whom the officers surrounded crowds of woundedsome known to pierre and some unknownrussians and french with facesdistorted by suffering walked crawled and were carried on stretchersfrom the battery pierre again went up onto the knoll where he had spentover an hour and of that family circle which had received him as amember he did not find a single one there were many dead whom he didnot know but some he recognized the young officer still sat in thesame way bent double in a pool of blood at the edge of the earth wallthe redfaced man was still twitching but they did not carry him awaypierre ran down the slope once morenow they will stop it now they will be horrified at what they havedone he thought aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearersmoving from the battlefieldbut behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high and in front andespecially to the left near semenovsk something seemed to be seethingin the smoke and the roar of cannon and musketry did not diminish buteven increased to desperation like a man who straining himself shriekswith all his remaining strengththe chief action of the battle of borodino was fought within the seventhousand feet between borodino and bagrations fleches beyond thatspace there was on the one side a demonstration made by the russianswith uvarovs cavalry at midday and on the other side beyond utitsaponiatowskis collision with tuchkov but these two were detached andfeeble actions in comparison with what took place in the center of thebattlefield on the field between borodino and the fleches beside thewood the chief action of the day took place on an open space visiblefrom both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless waythe battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundredgunsthen when the whole field was covered with smoke two divisionscampans and dessaixs advanced from the french right while muratstroops advanced on borodino from their leftfrom the shevardino redoubt where napoleon was standing the fleches weretwo thirds of a mile away and it was more than a mile as the crow fliesto borodino so that napoleon could not see what was happening thereespecially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole localitythe soldiers of dessaixs division advancing against the fleches couldonly be seen till they had entered the hollow that lay between them andthe fleches as soon as they had descended into that hollow the smokeof the guns and musketry on the fleches grew so dense that it coveredthe whole approach on that side of it through the smoke glimpses couldbe caught of something blackprobably menand at times the glint ofbayonets but whether they were moving or stationary whether they werefrench or russian could not be discovered from the shevardino redoubtthe sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight intonapoleons face as shading his eyes with his hand he looked at thefleches the smoke spread out before them and at times it looked as ifthe smoke were moving at times as if the troops moved sometimes shoutswere heard through the firing but it was impossible to tell what wasbeing done therenapoleon standing on the knoll looked through a field glass and inits small circlet saw smoke and men sometimes his own and sometimesrussians but when he looked again with the naked eye he could not tellwhere what he had seen washe descended the knoll and began walking up and down before itoccasionally he stopped listened to the firing and gazed intently atthe battlefieldbut not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from wherehe was standing down below or from the knoll above on which some of hisgenerals had taken their stand but even from the fleches themselvesinwhich by this time there were now russian and now french soldiersalternately or together dead wounded alive frightened or maddenedeven at those fleches themselves it was impossible to make out what wastaking place there for several hours amid incessant cannon and musketryfire now russians were seen alone now frenchmen alone now infantryand now cavalry they appeared fired fell collided not knowing whatto do with one another screamed and ran back againfrom the battlefield adjutants he had sent out and orderlies from hismarshals kept galloping up to napoleon with reports of the progress ofthe action but all these reports were false both because it wasimpossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any givenmoment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual placeof conflict but reported what they had heard from others and alsobecause while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to napoleoncircumstances changed and the news he brought was already becomingfalse thus an adjutant galloped up from murat with tidings thatborodino had been occupied and the bridge over the kolocha was in thehands of the french the adjutant asked whether napoleon wished thetroops to cross it napoleon gave orders that the troops should form upon the farther side and wait but before that order was givenalmost assoon in fact as the adjutant had left borodinothe bridge had beenretaken by the russians and burned in the very skirmish at which pierrehad been present at the beginning of the battlean adjutant galloped up from the fleches with a pale and frightened faceand reported to napoleon that their attack had been repulsed campanwounded and davout killed yet at the very time the adjutant had beentold that the french had been repulsed the fleches had in fact beenrecaptured by other french troops and davout was alive and onlyslightly bruised on the basis of these necessarily untrustworthyreports napoleon gave his orders which had either been executed beforehe gave them or could not be and were not executedthe marshals and generals who were nearer to the field of battle butlike napoleon did not take part in the actual fighting and onlyoccasionally went within musket range made their own arrangementswithout asking napoleon and issued orders where and in what direction tofire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry should run but eventheir orders like napoleons were seldom carried out and then butpartially for the most part things happened contrary to their orderssoldiers ordered to advance ran back on meeting grapeshot soldiersordered to remain where they were suddenly seeing russiansunexpectedly before them sometimes rushed back and sometimes forwardand the cavalry dashed without orders in pursuit of the flying russiansin this way two cavalry regiments galloped through the semenovsk hollowand as soon as they reached the top of the incline turned round andgalloped full speed back again the infantry moved in the same waysometimes running to quite other places than those they were ordered togo to all orders as to where and when to move the guns when to sendinfantry to shoot or horsemen to ride down the russian infantryallsuch orders were given by the officers on the spot nearest to the unitsconcerned without asking either ney davout or murat much lessnapoleon they did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfillingorders or for acting on their own initiative for in battle what is atstake is what is dearest to manhis own lifeand it sometimes seemsthat safety lies in running back sometimes in running forward andthese men who were right in the heat of the battle acted according tothe mood of the moment in reality however all these movements forwardand backward did not improve or alter the position of the troops alltheir rushing and galloping at one another did little harm the harm ofdisablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that flew overthe fields on which these men were floundering about as soon as theyleft the place where the balls and bullets were flying about theirsuperiors located in the background reformed them and brought themunder discipline and under the influence of that discipline led themback to the zone of fire where under the influence of fear of deaththey lost their discipline and rushed about according to the chancepromptings of the throngnapoleons generalsdavout ney and murat who were near that regionof fire and sometimes even entered itrepeatedly led into it hugemasses of wellordered troops but contrary to what had always happenedin their former battles instead of the news they expected of theenemys flight these orderly masses returned thence as disorganized andterrified mobs the generals reformed them but their numbersconstantly decreased in the middle of the day murat sent his adjutantto napoleon to demand reinforcementsnapoleon sat at the foot of the knoll drinking punch when muratsadjutant galloped up with an assurance that the russians would be routedif his majesty would let him have another divisionreinforcements said napoleon in a tone of stern surprise looking atthe adjutanta handsome lad with long black curls arranged like muratsownas though he did not understand his wordsreinforcements thought napoleon to himself how can they needreinforcements when they already have half the army directed against aweak unentrenched russian wingtell the king of naples said he sternly that it is not noon yetand i dont yet see my chessboard clearly gothe handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply withoutremoving his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were beingslaughterednapoleon rose and having summoned caulaincourt and berthier begantalking to them about matters unconnected with the battlein the midst of this conversation which was beginning to interestnapoleon berthiers eyes turned to look at a general with a suite whowas galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse it was belliardhaving dismounted he went up to the emperor with rapid strides and in aloud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sendingreinforcements he swore on his honor that the russians were lost if theemperor would give another divisionnapoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and downwithout replying belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to thegenerals of the suite around himyou are very fiery belliard said napoleon when he again came up tothe general in the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake goand have another look and then come back to mebefore belliard was out of sight a messenger from another part of thebattlefield galloped upnow then what do you want asked napoleon in the tone of a manirritated at being continually disturbedsire the prince began the adjutantasks for reinforcements said napoleon with an angry gesturethe adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report but theemperor turned from him took a couple of steps stopped came back andcalled berthierwe must give reserves he said moving his arms slightly apart whodo you think should be sent there he asked of berthier whom hesubsequently termed that gosling i have made an eaglesend claparedes division sire replied berthier who knew all thedivisions regiments and battalions by heartnapoleon nodded assentthe adjutant galloped to claparedes division and a few minutes laterthe young guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward napoleongazed silently in that directionno he suddenly said to berthier i cant send claparede sendfriants divisionthough there was no advantage in sending friants division instead ofclaparedes and even an obvious inconvenience and delay in stoppingclaparede and sending friant now the order was carried out exactlynapoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing thepart of a doctor who hinders by his medicinesa role he so justlyunderstood and condemnedfriants division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke ofthe battlefield from all sides adjutants continued to arrive at agallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing they all askedfor reinforcements and all said that the russians were holding theirpositions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the french army wasmelting awaynapoleon sat on a campstool wrapped in thoughtm de beausset the man so fond of travel having fasted since morningcame up to the emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to hismajestyi hope i may now congratulate your majesty on a victory said henapoleon silently shook his head in negation assuming the negation torefer only to the victory and not to the lunch m de beausset venturedwith respectful jocularity to remark that there is no reason for nothaving lunch when one can get itgo away exclaimed napoleon suddenly and morosely and turned asidea beatific smile of regret repentance and ecstasy beamed on m debeaussets face and he glided away to the other generalsnapoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an everlucky gambler who after recklessly flinging money about and alwayswinning suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of thegame finds that the more he considers his play the more surely heloseshis troops were the same his generals the same the same preparationshad been made the same dispositions and the same proclamation courteet energique he himself was still the same he knew that and knew thathe was now even more experienced and skillful than before even theenemy was the same as at austerlitz and friedlandyet the terriblestroke of his arm had supernaturally become impotentall the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with success theconcentration of batteries on one point an attack by reserves to breakthe enemys line and a cavalry attack by the men of iron all thesemethods had already been employed yet not only was there no victorybut from all sides came the same news of generals killed and wounded ofreinforcements needed of the impossibility of driving back therussians and of disorganization among his own troopsformerly after he had given two or three orders and uttered a fewphrases marshals and adjutants had come galloping up withcongratulations and happy faces announcing the trophies taken thecorps of prisoners bundles of enemy eagles and standards cannon andstores and murat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to gatherin the baggage wagons so it had been at lodi marengo arcola jenaausterlitz wagram and so on but now something strange was happeningto his troopsdespite news of the capture of the fleches napoleon saw that this wasnot the same not at all the same as what had happened in his formerbattles he saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men abouthim experienced in the art of war all their faces looked dejected andthey all shunned one anothers eyesonly a de beausset could fail tograsp the meaning of what was happeningbut napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of abattle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours after allefforts had been expended he knew that it was a lost battle and thatthe least accident might nowwith the fight balanced on such a strainedcenterdestroy him and his armywhen he ran his mind over the whole of this strange russian campaign inwhich not one battle had been won and in which not a flag or cannonor army corps had been captured in two months when he looked at theconcealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of therussians still holding their grounda terrible feeling like a nightmaretook possession of him and all the unlucky accidents that might destroyhim occurred to his mind the russians might fall on his left wingmight break through his center he himself might be killed by a straycannon ball all this was possible in former battles he had onlyconsidered the possibilities of success but now innumerable unluckychances presented themselves and he expected them all yes it was likea dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack himand raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knowsshould annihilate him but then feels that his arm drops powerless andlimp like a rag and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him inhis helplessnessthe news that the russians were attacking the left flank of the frencharmy aroused that horror in napoleon he sat silently on a campstoolbelow the knoll with head bowed and elbows on his knees berthierapproached and suggested that they should ride along the line toascertain the position of affairswhat what do you say asked napoleon yes tell them to bring me myhorsehe mounted and rode toward semenovskamid the powder smoke slowly dispersing over the whole space throughwhich napoleon rode horses and men were lying in pools of blood singlyor in heaps neither napoleon nor any of his generals had ever beforeseen such horrors or so many slain in such a small area the roar ofguns that had not ceased for ten hours wearied the ear and gave apeculiar significance to the spectacle as music does to tableauxvivants napoleon rode up the high ground at semenovsk and through thesmoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him theywere russiansthe russians stood in serried ranks behind semenovsk village and itsknoll and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent forthclouds of smoke it was no longer a battle it was a continuousslaughter which could be of no avail either to the french or therussians napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reveriefrom which berthier had aroused him he could not stop what was going onbefore him and around him and was supposed to be directed by him and todepend on him and from its lack of success this affair for the firsttime seemed to him unnecessary and horribleone of the generals rode up to napoleon and ventured to offer to leadthe old guard into action ney and berthier standing near napoleonexchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this generals senselessoffernapoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long timeat eight hundred leagues from france i will not have my guarddestroyed he said and turning his horse rode back to shevardinoon the rugcovered bench where pierre had seen him in the morning satkutuzov his gray head hanging his heavy body relaxed he gave noorders but only assented to or dissented from what others suggestedyes yes do that he replied to various proposals yes yes godear boy and have a look he would say to one or another of thoseabout him or no dont wed better wait he listened to the reportsthat were brought him and gave directions when his subordinates demandedthat of him but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he werenot interested in the import of the words spoken but rather insomething elsein the expression of face and tone of voice of those whowere reporting by long years of military experience he knew and withthe wisdom of age understood that it is impossible for one man todirect hundreds of thousands of others struggling with death and heknew that the result of a battle is decided not by the orders of acommanderinchief nor the place where the troops are stationed nor bythe number of cannon or of slaughtered men but by that intangible forcecalled the spirit of the army and he watched this force and guided itin as far as that was in his powerkutuzovs general expression was one of concentrated quiet attentionand his face wore a strained look as if he found it difficult to masterthe fatigue of his old and feeble bodyat eleven oclock they brought him news that the fleches captured by thefrench had been retaken but that prince bagration was wounded kutuzovgroaned and swayed his headride over to prince peter ivanovich and find out about it exactly hesaid to one of his adjutants and then turned to the duke of wurttembergwho was standing behind himwill your highness please take command of the first armysoon after the dukes departurebefore he could possibly have reachedsemenovskhis adjutant came back from him and told kutuzov that theduke asked for more troopskutuzov made a grimace and sent an order to dokhturov to take over thecommand of the first army and a request to the dukewhom he said hecould not spare at such an important momentto return to him when theybrought him news that murat had been taken prisoner and the staffofficers congratulated him kutuzov smiledwait a little gentlemen said he the battle is won and there isnothing extraordinary in the capture of murat still it is better towait before we rejoicebut he sent an adjutant to take the news round the armywhen scherbinin came galloping from the left flank with news that thefrench had captured the fleches and the village of semenovsk kutuzovguessing by the sounds of the battle and by scherbinins looks that thenews was bad rose as if to stretch his legs and taking scherbininsarm led him asidego my dear fellow he said to ermolov and see whether somethingcant be donekutuzov was in gorki near the center of the russian position theattack directed by napoleon against our left flank had been severaltimes repulsed in the center the french had not got beyond borodinoand on their left flank uvarovs cavalry had put the french to flighttoward three oclock the french attacks ceased on the faces of all whocame from the field of battle and of those who stood around himkutuzov noticed an expression of extreme tension he was satisfied withthe days successa success exceeding his expectations but the oldmans strength was failing him several times his head dropped low as ifit were falling and he dozed off dinner was brought himadjutant general wolzogen the man who when riding past prince andrewhad said the war should be extended widely and whom bagration sodetested rode up while kutuzov was at dinner wolzogen had come frombarclay de tolly to report on the progress of affairs on the left flankthe sagacious barclay de tolly seeing crowds of wounded men runningback and the disordered rear of the army weighed all the circumstancesconcluded that the battle was lost and sent his favorite officer to thecommander in chief with that newskutuzov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and glancedat wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering lidswolzogen nonchalantly stretching his legs approached kutuzov with ahalfcontemptuous smile on his lips scarcely touching the peak of hiscaphe treated his serene highness with a somewhat affected nonchalanceintended to show that as a highly trained military man he left it torussians to make an idol of this useless old man but that he knew whomhe was dealing with der alte herr as in their own set the germanscalled kutuzov is making himself very comfortable thought wolzogenand looking severely at the dishes in front of kutuzov he began toreport to the old gentleman the position of affairs on the left flankas barclay had ordered him to and as he himself had seen and understooditall the points of our position are in the enemys hands and we cannotdislodge them for lack of troops the men are running away and it isimpossible to stop them he reportedkutuzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on wolzogen as ifnot understanding what was said to him wolzogen noticing the oldgentlemans agitation said with a smilei have not considered it right to conceal from your serene highnesswhat i have seen the troops are in complete disorderyou have seen you have seen kutuzov shouted frowning and risingquickly he went up to wolzogenhow how dare you he shouted choking and making a threateninggesture with his trembling arms how dare you sir say that to me youknow nothing about it tell general barclay from me that his informationis incorrect and that the real course of the battle is better known tome the commanderinchief than to himwolzogen was about to make a rejoinder but kutuzov interrupted himthe enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on the rightflank if you have seen amiss sir do not allow yourself to say whatyou dont know be so good as to ride to general barclay and inform himof my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow said kutuzovsternlyall were silent and the only sound audible was the heavy breathing ofthe panting old generalthey are repulsed everywhere for which i thank god and our brave armythe enemy is beaten and tomorrow we shall drive him from the sacredsoil of russia said kutuzov crossing himself and he suddenly sobbedas his eyes filled with tearswolzogen shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips stepped silentlyaside marveling at the old gentlemans conceited stupidityah here he is my hero said kutuzov to a portly handsome darkhaired general who was just ascending the knollthis was raevski who had spent the whole day at the most important partof the field of borodinoraevski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground andthat the french no longer ventured to attackafter hearing him kutuzov said in frenchthen you do not think like some others that we must retreaton the contrary your highness in indecisive actions it is always themost stubborn who remain victors replied raevski and in myopinionkaysarov kutuzov called to his adjutant sit down and write out theorder of the day for tomorrow and you he continued addressinganother ride along the line and announce that tomorrow we attackwhile kutuzov was talking to raevski and dictating the order of the daywolzogen returned from barclay and said that general barclay wished tohave written confirmation of the order the field marshal had givenkutuzov without looking at wolzogen gave directions for the order tobe written out which the former commanderinchief to avoid personalresponsibility very judiciously wished to receiveand by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintainsthroughout an army one and the same temper known as the spirit of thearmy and which constitutes the sinew of war kutuzovs words hisorder for a battle next day immediately became known from one end ofthe army to the otherit was far from being the same words or the same order that reached thefarthest links of that chain the tales passing from mouth to mouth atdifferent ends of the army did not even resemble what kutuzov had saidbut the sense of his words spread everywhere because what he said wasnot the outcome of cunning calculations but of a feeling that lay inthe commanderinchiefs soul as in that of every russianand on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy and hearingfrom the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believethe exhausted wavering men felt comforted and inspiritedprince andrews regiment was among the reserves which till after oneoclock were stationed inactive behind semenovsk under heavy artilleryfire toward two oclock the regiment having already lost more than twohundred men was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gapbetween semenovsk and the knoll battery where thousands of men perishedthat day and on which an intense concentrated fire from several hundredenemy guns was directed between one and two oclockwithout moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment herelost another third of its men from in front and especially from theright in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed and out of the mysteriousdomain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front quick hissingcannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly at times as ifto allow them a respite a quarter of an hour passed during which thecannon balls and shells all flew overhead but sometimes several menwere torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continuallybeing dragged away and the wounded carried offwith each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those notyet killed the regiment stood in columns of battalion three hundredpaces apart but nevertheless the men were always in one and the samemood all alike were taciturn and morose talk was rarely heard in theranks and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful shotand the cry of stretchers was heard most of the time by theirofficers order the men sat on the ground one having taken off hisshako carefully loosened the gathers of its lining and drew them tightagain another rubbing some dry clay between his palms polished hisbayonet another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of hisbandolier while another smoothed and refolded his leg bands and put hisboots on again some built little houses of the tufts in the plowedground or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield all seemedfully absorbed in these pursuits when men were killed or wounded whenrows of stretchers went past when some troops retreated and when greatmasses of the enemy came into view through the smoke no one paid anyattention to these things but when our artillery or cavalry advanced orsome of our infantry were seen to move forward words of approval wereheard on all sides but the liveliest attention was attracted byoccurrences quite apart from and unconnected with the battle it wasas if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everydaycommonplace occurrences a battery of artillery was passing in front ofthe regiment the horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a tracehey look at the trace horse get her leg out shell fall ahthey dont see it came identical shouts from the ranks all along theregiment another time general attention was attracted by a small browndog coming heaven knows whence which trotted in a preoccupied mannerin front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fellclose by when it yelped tucked its tail between its legs and dartedaside yells and shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment butsuch distractions lasted only a moment and for eight hours the men hadbeen inactive without food in constant fear of death and their paleand gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomierprince andrew pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment paced upand down from the border of one patch to another at the edge of themeadow beside an oatfield with head bowed and arms behind his backthere was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given everythingwent on of itself the killed were dragged from the front the woundedcarried away and the ranks closed up if any soldiers ran to the rearthey returned immediately and hastily at first prince andrewconsidering it his duty to rouse the courage of the men and to set theman example walked about among the ranks but he soon became convincedthat this was unnecessary and that there was nothing he could teachthem all the powers of his soul as of every soldier there wereunconsciously bent on avoiding the contemplation of the horrors of theirsituation he walked along the meadow dragging his feet rustling thegrass and gazing at the dust that covered his boots now he took bigstrides trying to keep to the footprints left on the meadow by themowers then he counted his steps calculating how often he must walkfrom one strip to another to walk a mile then he stripped the flowersfrom the wormwood that grew along a boundary rut rubbed them in hispalms and smelled their pungent sweetly bitter scent nothing remainedof the previous days thoughts he thought of nothing he listened withweary ears to the everrecurring sounds distinguishing the whistle offlying projectiles from the booming of the reports glanced at thetiresomely familiar faces of the men of the first battalion and waitedhere it comes this one is coming our way again he thoughtlistening to an approaching whistle in the hidden region of smoke oneanother again it has hit he stopped and looked at the ranks noit has gone over but this one has hit and again he started trying toreach the boundary strip in sixteen paces a whizz and a thud fivepaces from him a cannon ball tore up the dry earth and disappeared achill ran down his back again he glanced at the ranks probably manyhad been hita large crowd had gathered near the second battalionadjutant he shouted order them not to crowd togetherthe adjutant having obeyed this instruction approached prince andrewfrom the other side a battalion commander rode uplook out came a frightened cry from a soldier and like a birdwhirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground a shell droppedwith little noise within two steps of prince andrew and close to thebattalion commanders horse the horse first regardless of whether itwas right or wrong to show fear snorted reared almost throwing themajor and galloped aside the horses terror infected the menlie down cried the adjutant throwing himself flat on the groundprince andrew hesitated the smoking shell spun like a top between himand the prostrate adjutant near a wormwood plant between the field andthe meadowcan this be death thought prince andrew looking with a quite newenvious glance at the grass the wormwood and the streamlet of smokethat curled up from the rotating black ball i cannot i do not wish todie i love lifei love this grass this earth this air hethought this and at the same time remembered that people were lookingat himits shameful sir he said to the adjutant whathe did not finish speaking at one and the same moment came the sound ofan explosion a whistle of splinters as from a breaking window frame asuffocating smell of powder and prince andrew started to one sideraising his arm and fell on his chest several officers ran up to himfrom the right side of his abdomen blood was welling out making a largestain on the grassthe militiamen with stretchers who were called up stood behind theofficers prince andrew lay on his chest with his face in the grassbreathing heavily and noisilywhat are you waiting for come alongthe peasants went up and took him by his shoulders and legs but hemoaned piteously and exchanging looks they set him down againpick him up lift him its all the same cried someonethey again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcherah god my god what is it the stomach that means death my godvoices among the officers were heard sayingit flew a hairs breadth past my ear said the adjutantthe peasants adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders startedhurriedly along the path they had trodden down to the dressing stationkeep in step ah those peasants shouted an officer seizing bytheir shoulders and checking the peasants who were walking unevenly andjolting the stretcherget into step fedor i say fedor said the foremost peasantnow thats right said the one behind joyfully when he had got intostepyour excellency eh prince said the trembling voice of timokhin whohad run up and was looking down on the stretcherprince andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from thestretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his eyelidsdroopedthe militiamen carried prince andrew to the dressing station by thewood where wagons were stationed the dressing station consisted ofthree tents with flaps turned back pitched at the edge of a birch woodin the wood wagons and horses were standing the horses were eatingoats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down and pecked thegrains that fell some crows scenting blood flew among the birch treescawing impatiently around the tents over more than five acresbloodstained men in various garbs stood sat or lay around the woundedstood crowds of soldier stretcherbearers with dismal and attentivefaces whom the officers keeping order tried in vain to drive from thespot disregarding the officers orders the soldiers stood leaningagainst their stretchers and gazing intently as if trying to comprehendthe difficult problem of what was taking place before them from thetents came now loud angry cries and now plaintive groans occasionallydressers ran out to fetch water or to point out those who were to bebrought in next the wounded men awaiting their turn outside the tentsgroaned sighed wept screamed swore or asked for vodka some weredelirious prince andrews bearers stepping over the wounded who hadnot yet been bandaged took him as a regimental commander close up toone of the tents and there stopped awaiting instructions prince andrewopened his eyes and for a long time could not make out what was going onaround him he remembered the meadow the wormwood the field thewhirling black ball and his sudden rush of passionate love of life twosteps from him leaning against a branch and talking loudly andattracting general attention stood a tall handsome blackhairednoncommissioned officer with a bandaged head he had been wounded in thehead and leg by bullets around him eagerly listening to his talk acrowd of wounded and stretcherbearers was gatheredwe kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything we grabbedthe king himself cried he looking around him with eyes that glitteredwith fever if only reserves had come up just then lads therewouldnt have been nothing left of him i tell you surelylike all the others near the speaker prince andrew looked at him withshining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort but isnt it all thesame now thought he and what will be there and what has there beenhere why was i so reluctant to part with life there was something inthis life i did not and do not understandone of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron holdinga cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his smallbloodstained hands so as not to smear it he raised his head and lookedabout him but above the level of the wounded men he evidently wanted alittle respite after turning his head from right to left for some timehe sighed and looked downall right immediately he replied to a dresser who pointed princeandrew out to him and he told them to carry him into the tentmurmurs arose among the wounded who were waitingit seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have achance remarked oneprince andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only just beencleared and which a dresser was washing down prince andrew could notmake out distinctly what was in that tent the pitiful groans from allsides and the torturing pain in his thigh stomach and back distractedhim all he saw about him merged into a general impression of nakedbleeding human bodies that seemed to fill the whole of the low tent asa few weeks previously on that hot august day such bodies had filledthe dirty pond beside the smolensk road yes it was the same flesh thesame chair a canon the sight of which had even then filled him withhorror as by a presentimentthere were three operating tables in the tent two were occupied and onthe third they placed prince andrew for a little while he was leftalone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on the other twotables on the nearest one sat a tartar probably a cossack judging bythe uniform thrown down beside him four soldiers were holding him anda spectacled doctor was cutting into his muscular brown backooh ooh ooh grunted the tartar and suddenly lifting up his swarthysnubnosed face with its high cheekbones and baring his white teeth hebegan to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing ringing andprolonged yells on the other table round which many people werecrowding a tall wellfed man lay on his back with his head thrown backhis curly hair its color and the shape of his head seemed strangelyfamiliar to prince andrew several dressers were pressing on his chestto hold him down one large white plump leg twitched rapidly all thetime with a feverish tremor the man was sobbing and chokingconvulsively two doctorsone of whom was pale and tremblingweresilently doing something to this mans other gory leg when he hadfinished with the tartar whom they covered with an overcoat thespectacled doctor came up to prince andrew wiping his handshe glanced at prince andrews face and quickly turned awayundress him what are you waiting for he cried angrily to thedressershis very first remotest recollections of childhood came back to princeandrews mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily toundo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him the doctor bent downover the wound felt it and sighed deeply then he made a sign tosomeone and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused prince andrew tolose consciousness when he came to himself the splintered portions ofhis thighbone had been extracted the torn flesh cut away and the woundbandaged water was being sprinkled on his face as soon as princeandrew opened his eyes the doctor bent over kissed him silently on thelips and hurried awayafter the sufferings he had been enduring prince andrew enjoyed ablissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time all thebest and happiest moments of his lifeespecially his earliestchildhood when he used to be undressed and put to bed and when leaningover him his nurse sang him to sleep and he burying his head in thepillow felt happy in the mere consciousness of lifereturned to hismemory not merely as something past but as something presentthe doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of whosehead seemed familiar to prince andrew they were lifting him up andtrying to quiet himshow it to me oh ooh oh oh ooh his frightened moans couldbe heard subdued by suffering and broken by sobshearing those moans prince andrew wanted to weep whether because he wasdying without glory or because he was sorry to part with life orbecause of those memories of a childhood that could not return orbecause he was suffering and others were suffering and that man near himwas groaning so piteouslyhe felt like weeping childlike kindly andalmost happy tearsthe wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted bloodand with the boot still onoh oh ooh he sobbed like a womanthe doctor who had been standing beside him preventing prince andrewfrom seeing his face moved awaymy god what is this why is he here said prince andrew to himselfin the miserable sobbing enfeebled man whose leg had just beenamputated he recognized anatole kuragin men were supporting him intheir arms and offering him a glass of water but his trembling swollenlips could not grasp its rim anatole was sobbing painfully yes it ishe yes that man is somehow closely and painfully connected with methought prince andrew not yet clearly grasping what he saw before himwhat is the connection of that man with my childhood and life heasked himself without finding an answer and suddenly a new unexpectedmemory from that realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself tohim he remembered natasha as he had seen her for the first time at theball in  with her slender neck and arms and with a frightened happyface ready for rapture and love and tenderness for her stronger andmore vivid than ever awoke in his soul he now remembered theconnection that existed between himself and this man who was dimlygazing at him through tears that filled his swollen eyes he rememberedeverything and ecstatic pity and love for that man overflowed his happyheartprince andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender lovingtears for his fellow men for himself and for his own and their errorscompassion love of our brothers for those who love us and for thosewho hate us love of our enemies yes that love which god preached onearth and which princess mary taught me and i did not understandthatis what made me sorry to part with life that is what remained for mehad i lived but now it is too late i know itthe terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and woundedtogether with the heaviness of his head and the news that some twentygenerals he knew personally had been killed or wounded and theconsciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm produced anunexpected impression on napoleon who usually liked to look at thekilled and wounded thereby he considered testing his strength ofmind this day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame thatstrength of mind which he thought constituted his merit and hisgreatness he rode hurriedly from the battlefield and returned to theshevardino knoll where he sat on his campstool his sallow face swollenand heavy his eyes dim his nose red and his voice hoarseinvoluntarily listening with downcast eyes to the sounds of firingwith painful dejection he awaited the end of this action in which heregarded himself as a participant and which he was unable to arrest apersonal human feeling for a brief moment got the better of theartificial phantasm of life he had served so long he felt in his ownperson the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield theheaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility ofsuffering and death for himself at that moment he did not desiremoscow or victory or glory what need had he for any more glory theone thing he wished for was rest tranquillity and freedom but when hehad been on the semenovsk heights the artillery commander had proposedto him to bring several batteries of artillery up to those heights tostrengthen the fire on the russian troops crowded in front of knyazkovonapoleon had assented and had given orders that news should be broughtto him of the effect those batteries producedan adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns hadbeen concentrated on the russians as he had ordered but that theystill held their groundour fire is mowing them down by rows but still they hold on said theadjutantthey want more said napoleon in a hoarse voicesire asked the adjutant who had not heard the remarkthey want more croaked napoleon frowning let them have iteven before he gave that order the thing he did not desire and forwhich he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of himwas being done and he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginarygreatness and againas a horse walking a treadmill thinks it is doingsomething for itselfhe submissively fulfilled the cruel sad gloomyand inhuman role predestined for himand not for that day and hour alone were the mind and consciencedarkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happeninglay more than on all the others who took part in it never to the end ofhis life could he understand goodness beauty or truth or thesignificance of his actions which were too contrary to goodness andtruth too remote from everything human for him ever to be able tograsp their meaning he could not disavow his actions belauded as theywere by half the world and so he had to repudiate truth goodness andall humanitynot only on that day as he rode over the battlefield strewn with menkilled and maimed by his will as he believed did he reckon as helooked at them how many russians there were for each frenchman anddeceiving himself find reason for rejoicing in the calculation thatthere were five russians for every frenchman not on that day alone didhe write in a letter to paris that the battle field was superbbecause fifty thousand corpses lay there but even on the island of sthelena in the peaceful solitude where he said he intended to devote hisleisure to an account of the great deeds he had done he wrotethe russian war should have been the most popular war of modern timesit was a war of good sense for real interests for the tranquillity andsecurity of all it was purely pacific and conservativeit was a

forty thousand who spoke french therussian expedition actually cost france less than fifty thousand menthe russian army in its retreat from vilna to moscow lost in the variousbattles four times more men than the french army the burning of moscowcost the lives of a hundred thousand russians who died of cold and wantin the woods finally in its march from moscow to the oder the russianarmy also suffered from the severity of the season so that by the timeit reached vilna it numbered only fifty thousand and at kalisch lessthan eighteen thousandhe imagined that the war with russia came about by his will and thehorrors that occurred did not stagger his soul he boldly took the wholeresponsibility for what happened and his darkened mind foundjustification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands whoperished there were fewer frenchmen than hessians and bavariansseveral tens of thousands of the slain lay in diverse postures andvarious uniforms on the fields and meadows belonging to the davydovfamily and to the crown serfsthose fields and meadows where forhundreds of years the peasants of borodino gorki shevardino andsemenovsk had reaped their harvests and pastured their cattle at thedressing stations the grass and earth were soaked with blood for a spaceof some three acres around crowds of men of various arms wounded andunwounded with frightened faces dragged themselves back to mozhayskfrom the one army and back to valuevo from the other other crowdsexhausted and hungry went forward led by their officers others heldtheir ground and continued to fireover the whole field previously so gaily beautiful with the glitter ofbayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun there now spread amist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell of saltpeter and bloodclouds gathered and drops of rain began to fall on the dead and woundedon the frightened exhausted and hesitating men as if to say enoughmen enough cease bethink yourselves what are you doingto the men of both sides alike worn out by want of food and rest itbegan equally to appear doubtful whether they should continue toslaughter one another all the faces expressed hesitation and thequestion arose in every soul for what for whom must i kill and bekilled you may go and kill whom you please but i dont want to doso anymore by evening this thought had ripened in every soul at anymoment these men might have been seized with horror at what they weredoing and might have thrown up everything and run away anywherebut though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the horror ofwhat they were doing though they would have been glad to leave offsome incomprehensible mysterious power continued to control them andthey still brought up the charges loaded aimed and applied the matchthough only one artilleryman survived out of every three and thoughthey stumbled and panted with fatigue perspiring and stained with bloodand powder the cannon balls flew just as swiftly and cruelly from bothsides crushing human bodies and that terrible work which was not doneby the will of a man but at the will of him who governs men and worldscontinuedanyone looking at the disorganized rear of the russian army would havesaid that if only the french made one more slight effort it woulddisappear and anyone looking at the rear of the french army would havesaid that the russians need only make one more slight effort and thefrench would be destroyed but neither the french nor the russians madethat effort and the flame of battle burned slowly outthe russians did not make that effort because they were not attackingthe french at the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the wayto moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at thebeginning but even had the aim of the russians been to drive the frenchfrom their positions they could not have made this last effort for allthe russian troops had been broken up there was no part of the russianarmy that had not suffered in the battle and though still holding theirpositions they had lost one half of their armythe french with the memory of all their former victories during fifteenyears with the assurance of napoleons invincibility with theconsciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and hadlost only a quarter of their men and still had their guards intacttwenty thousand strong might easily have made that effort the frenchwho had attacked the russian army in order to drive it from its positionought to have made that effort for as long as the russians continued toblock the road to moscow as before the aim of the french had not beenattained and all their efforts and losses were in vain but the frenchdid not make that effort some historians say that napoleon need onlyhave used his old guards who were intact and the battle would havebeen won to speak of what would have happened had napoleon sent hisguards is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring itcould not be napoleon did not give his guards not because he did notwant to but because it could not be done all the generals officersand soldiers of the french army knew it could not be done because theflagging spirit of the troops would not permit itit was not napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling ofthe mighty arm being stricken powerless but all the generals andsoldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or notafter all their experience of previous battleswhen after one tenth ofsuch efforts the enemy had fledexperienced a similar feeling of terrorbefore an enemy who after losing half his men stood as threateninglyat the end as at the beginning of the battle the moral force of theattacking french army was exhausted not that sort of victory which isdefined by the capture of pieces of material fastened to sticks calledstandards and of the ground on which the troops had stood and werestanding but a moral victory that convinces the enemy of the moralsuperiority of his opponent and of his own impotence was gained by therussians at borodino the french invaders like an infuriated animalthat has in its onslaught received a mortal wound felt that they wereperishing but could not stop any more than the russian army weaker byone half could help swerving by impetus gained the french army wasstill able to roll forward to moscow but there without further efforton the part of the russians it had to perish bleeding from the mortalwound it had received at borodino the direct consequence of the battleof borodino was napoleons senseless flight from moscow his retreatalong the old smolensk road the destruction of the invading army offive hundred thousand men and the downfall of napoleonic france onwhich at borodino for the first time the hand of an opponent of strongerspirit had been laidabsolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human mindlaws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only when heexamines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion but at the sametime a large proportion of human error comes from the arbitrarydivision of continuous motion into discontinuous elements there is awell known socalled sophism of the ancients consisting in this thatachilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following in spiteof the fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise by thetime achilles has covered the distance that separated him from thetortoise the tortoise has covered one tenth of that distance ahead ofhim when achilles has covered that tenth the tortoise has coveredanother one hundredth and so on forever this problem seemed to theancients insoluble the absurd answer that achilles could neverovertake the tortoise resulted from this that motion was arbitrarilydivided into discontinuous elements whereas the motion both of achillesand of the tortoise was continuousby adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only approach asolution of the problem but never reach it only when we have admittedthe conception of the infinitely small and the resulting geometricalprogression with a common ratio of one tenth and have found the sum ofthis progression to infinity do we reach a solution of the problema modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing withthe infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more complexproblems of motion which used to appear insolublethis modern branch of mathematics unknown to the ancients when dealingwith problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely smalland so conforms to the chief condition of motion absolute continuityand thereby corrects the inevitable error which the human mind cannotavoid when it deals with separate elements of motion instead ofexamining continuous motionin seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing happensthe movement of humanity arising as it does from innumerable arbitraryhuman wills is continuousto understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim ofhistory but to arrive at these laws resulting from the sum of allthose human wills mans mind postulates arbitrary and disconnectedunits the first method of history is to take an arbitrarily selectedseries of continuous events and examine it apart from others thoughthere is and can be no beginning to any event for one event alwaysflows uninterruptedly from anotherthe second method is to consider the actions of some one mana king ora commanderas equivalent to the sum of many individual wills whereasthe sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of asingle historic personagehistorical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continuallytakes smaller and smaller units for examination but however small theunits it takes we feel that to take any unit disconnected from othersor to assume a beginning of any phenomenon or to say that the will ofmany men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage isin itself falseit needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductionsdrawn from history it is merely necessary to select some larger orsmaller unit as the subject of observationas criticism has every rightto do seeing that whatever unit history observes must always bearbitrarily selectedonly by taking infinitesimally small units for observation thedifferential of history that is the individual tendencies of men andattaining to the art of integrating them that is finding the sum ofthese infinitesimals can we hope to arrive at the laws of historythe first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in europe present anextraordinary movement of millions of people men leave their customarypursuits hasten from one side of europe to the other plunder andslaughter one another triumph and are plunged in despair and for someyears the whole course of life is altered and presents an intensivemovement which first increases and then slackens what was the cause ofthis movement by what laws was it governed asks the mind of manthe historians replying to this question lay before us the sayings anddoings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of paris callingthese sayings and doings the revolution then they give a detailedbiography of napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to himtell of the influence some of these people had on others and say thatis why this movement took place and those are its lawsbut the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation butplainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious because init a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger the sum ofhuman wills produced the revolution and napoleon and only the sum ofthose wills first tolerated and then destroyed thembut every time there have been conquests there have been conquerorsevery time there has been a revolution in any state there have beengreat men says history and indeed human reason replies every timeconquerors appear there have been wars but this does not prove that theconquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of awar in the personal activity of a single man whenever i look at mywatch and its hands point to ten i hear the bells of the neighboringchurch but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clockreach ten i have no right to assume that the movement of the bells iscaused by the position of the hands of the watchwhenever i see the movement of a locomotive i hear the whistle and seethe valves opening and wheels turning but i have no right to concludethat the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of themovement of the enginethe peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the oaksare budding and really every spring cold winds do blow when the oak isbudding but though i do not know what causes the cold winds to blowwhen the oak buds unfold i cannot agree with the peasants that theunfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind for the forceof the wind is beyond the influence of the buds i see only acoincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena oflife and i see that however much and however carefully i observe thehands of the watch and the valves and wheels of the engine and theoak i shall not discover the cause of the bells ringing the enginemoving or of the winds of spring to that i must entirely change mypoint of view and study the laws of the movement of steam of the bellsand of the wind history must do the same and attempts in thisdirection have already been madeto study the laws of history we must completely change the subject ofour observation must leave aside kings ministers and generals andstudy the common infinitesimally small elements by which the masses aremoved no one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance inthis way toward an understanding of the laws of history but it isevident that only along that path does the possibility of discoveringthe laws of history lie and that as yet not a millionth part as muchmental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as hasbeen devoted to describing the actions of various kings commanders andministers and propounding the historians own reflections concerningthese actionsthe forces of a dozen european nations burst into russia the russianarmy and people avoided a collision till smolensk was reached and againfrom smolensk to borodino the french army pushed on to moscow itsgoal its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim just as thevelocity of a falling body increases as it approaches the earth behindit were seven hundred miles of hungerstricken hostile country aheadwere a few dozen miles separating it from its goal every soldier innapoleons army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentumthe more the russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatredof the enemy flared up and while it retreated the army increased andconsolidated at borodino a collision took place neither army wasbroken up but the russian army retreated immediately after thecollision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with anotherhaving a greater momentum and with equal inevitability the ball ofinvasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on for somedistance though the collision had deprived it of all its forcethe russians retreated eighty milesto beyond moscowand the frenchreached moscow and there came to a standstill for five weeks after thatthere was not a single battle the french did not move as a bleedingmortally wounded animal licks its wounds they remained inert in moscowfor five weeks and then suddenly with no fresh reason fled back theymade a dash for the kaluga road and after a victoryfor at maloyaroslavets the field of conflict again remained theirs withoutundertaking a single serious battle they fled still more rapidly backto smolensk beyond smolensk beyond the berezina beyond vilna andfarther stillon the evening of the twentysixth of august kutuzov and the wholerussian army were convinced that the battle of borodino was a victorykutuzov reported so to the emperor he gave orders to prepare for afresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive anyonebut because he knew that the enemy was beaten as everyone who had takenpart in the battle knew itbut all that evening and next day reports came in one after another ofunheardof losses of the loss of half the army and a fresh battleproved physically impossibleit was impossible to give battle before information had been collectedthe wounded gathered in the supplies of ammunition replenished theslain reckoned up new officers appointed to replace those who had beenkilled and before the men had had food and sleep and meanwhile thevery next morning after the battle the french army advanced of itselfupon the russians carried forward by the force of its own momentum nowseemingly increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distancefrom its aim kutuzovs wish was to attack next day and the whole armydesired to do so but to make an attack the wish to do so is notsufficient there must also be a possibility of doing it and thatpossibility did not exist it was impossible not to retreat a daysmarch and then in the same way it was impossible not to retreat anotherand a third days march and at last on the first of september when thearmy drew near moscowdespite the strength of the feeling that hadarisen in all ranksthe force of circumstances compelled it to retirebeyond moscow and the troops retired one more last days march andabandoned moscow to the enemyfor people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles aremade by generalsas any one of us sitting over a map in his study mayimagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battlethequestions present themselves why did kutuzov during the retreat not dothis or that why did he not take up a position before reaching filiwhy did he not retire at once by the kaluga road abandoning moscow andso on people accustomed to think in that way forget or do not knowthe inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of anycommander in chief the activity of a commanderinchief does not at allresemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at ease in ourstudies examining some campaign on the map with a certain number oftroops on this and that side in a certain known locality and begin ourplans from some given moment a commanderinchief is never dealing withthe beginning of any eventthe position from which we alwayscontemplate it the commanderinchief is always in the midst of aseries of shifting events and so he never can at any moment consider thewhole import of an event that is occurring moment by moment the eventis imperceptibly shaping itself and at every moment of this continuousuninterrupted shaping of events the commanderinchief is in the midstof a most complex play of intrigues worries contingenciesauthorities projects counsels threats and deceptions and iscontinually obliged to reply to innumerable questions addressed to himwhich constantly conflict with one anotherlearned military authorities quite seriously tell us that kutuzov shouldhave moved his army to the kaluga road long before reaching fili andthat somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him but a commanderin chief especially at a difficult moment has always before him notone proposal but dozens simultaneously and all these proposals basedon strategics and tactics contradict each othera commanderinchiefs business it would seem is simply to choose oneof these projects but even that he cannot do events and time do notwait for instance on the twentyeighth it is suggested to him to crossto the kaluga road but just then an adjutant gallops up frommiloradovich asking whether he is to engage the french or retire anorder must be given him at once that instant and the order to retreatcarries us past the turn to the kaluga road and after the adjutantcomes the commissary general asking where the stores are to be takenand the chief of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go and acourier from petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign which doesnot admit of the possibility of abandoning moscow and the commanderinchiefs rival the man who is undermining him and there are always notmerely one but several such presents a new project diametricallyopposed to that of turning to the kaluga road and the commanderinchief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy and arespectable general who has been overlooked in the distribution ofrewards comes to complain and the inhabitants of the district pray tobe defended and an officer sent to inspect the locality comes in andgives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer previouslysent and a spy a prisoner and a general who has been onreconnaissance all describe the position of the enemys armydifferently people accustomed to misunderstand or to forget theseinevitable conditions of a commanderinchiefs actions describe to usfor instance the position of the army at fili and assume that thecommanderinchief could on the first of september quite freely decidewhether to abandon moscow or defend it whereas with the russian armyless than four miles from moscow no such question existed when hadthat question been settled at drissa and at smolensk and most palpablyof all on the twentyfourth of august at shevardino and on the twentysixth at borodino and each day and hour and minute of the retreat fromborodino to filiwhen ermolov having been sent by kutuzov to inspect the position toldthe field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before moscowand that they must retreat kutuzov looked at him in silencegive me your hand said he and turning it over so as to feel thepulse added you are not well my dear fellow think what you aresayingkutuzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond moscowwithout a battleon the poklonny hill four miles from the dorogomilov gate of moscowkutuzov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the roadsidea great crowd of generals gathered round him and count rostopchin whohad come out from moscow joined them this brilliant company separatedinto several groups who all discussed the advantages and disadvantagesof the position the state of the army the plans suggested thesituation of moscow and military questions generally though they hadnot been summoned for the purpose and though it was not so called theyall felt that this was really a council of war the conversations alldealt with public questions if anyone gave or asked for personal newsit was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to generalmatters no jokes or laughter or smiles even were seen among allthese men they evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at theheight the situation demanded and all these groups while talking amongthemselves tried to keep near the commanderinchief whose benchformed the center of the gathering and to speak so that he mightoverhear them the commander in chief listened to what was being saidand sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks but did not himselftake part in the conversations or express any opinion after hearingwhat was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turnedaway with an air of disappointment as though they were not speaking ofanything he wished to hear some discussed the position that had beenchosen criticizing not the position itself so much as the mentalcapacity of those who had chosen it others argued that a mistake hadbeen made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two daysbefore others again spoke of the battle of salamanca which wasdescribed by crosart a newly arrived frenchman in a spanish uniformthis frenchman and one of the german princes serving with the russianarmy were discussing the siege of saragossa and considering thepossibility of defending moscow in a similar manner count rostopchinwas telling a fourth group that he was prepared to die with the citytrain bands under the walls of the capital but that he still could nothelp regretting having been left in ignorance of what was happening andthat had he known it sooner things would have been different a fifthgroup displaying the profundity of their strategic perceptionsdiscussed the direction the troops would now have to take a sixth groupwas talking absolute nonsense kutuzovs expression grew more and morepreoccupied and gloomy from all this talk he saw only one thing thatto defend moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning ofthose words that is to say so utterly impossible that if any senselesscommander were to give orders to fight confusion would result but thebattle would still not take place it would not take place because thecommanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible butin their conversations were only discussing what would happen after itsinevitable abandonment how could the commanders lead their troops to afield of battle they considered impossible to hold the lowergradeofficers and even the soldiers who too reason also considered theposition impossible and therefore could not go to fight fully convincedas they were of defeat if bennigsen insisted on the position beingdefended and others still discussed it the question was no longerimportant in itself but only as a pretext for disputes and intriguethis kutuzov knew wellbennigsen who had chosen the position warmly displayed his russianpatriotism kutuzov could not listen to this without wincing byinsisting that moscow must be defended his aim was as clear as daylightto kutuzov if the defense failed to throw the blame on kutuzov who hadbrought the army as far as the sparrow hills without giving battle ifit succeeded to claim the success as his own or if battle were notgiven to clear himself of the crime of abandoning moscow but thisintrigue did not now occupy the old mans mind one terrible questionabsorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone thequestion for him now was have i really allowed napoleon to reachmoscow and when did i do so when was it decided can it have beenyesterday when i ordered platov to retreat or was it the eveningbefore when i had a nap and told bennigsen to issue orders or was itearlier still when when was this terrible affair decided moscowmust be abandoned the army must retreat and the order to do so must begiven to give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent toresigning the command of the army and not only did he love power towhich he was accustomed the honours awarded to prince prozorovskiunder whom he had served in turkey galled him but he was convincedthat he was destined to save russia and that that was why against theemperors wish and by the will of the people he had been chosencommanderinchief he was convinced that he alone could maintaincommand of the army in these difficult circumstances and that in allthe world he alone could encounter the invincible napoleon without fearand he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue butsomething had to be decided and these conversations around him whichwere assuming too free a character must be stoppedhe called the most important generals to himmy head be it good or bad must depend on itself said he risingfrom the bench and he rode to fili where his carriages were waitingthe council of war began to assemble at two in the afternoon in thebetter and roomier part of andrew savostyanovs hut the men women andchildren of the large peasant family crowded into the back room acrossthe passage only malasha andrews sixyearold granddaughter whom hisserene highness had petted and to whom he had given a lump of sugarwhile drinking his tea remained on the top of the brick oven in thelarger room malasha looked down from the oven with shy delight at thefaces uniforms and decorations of the generals who one after anothercame into the room and sat down on the broad benches in the corner underthe icons granddad himself as malasha in her own mind calledkutuzov sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven he sat sunk deepin a folding armchair and continually cleared his throat and pulled atthe collar of his coat which though it was unbuttoned still seemed topinch his neck those who entered went up one by one to the fieldmarshal he pressed the hands of some and nodded to others his adjutantkaysarov was about to draw back the curtain of the window facingkutuzov but the latter moved his hand angrily and kaysarov understoodthat his serene highness did not wish his face to be seenround the peasants deal table on which lay maps plans pencils andpapers so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in anotherbench and put it beside the table ermolov kaysarov and toll who hadjust arrived sat down on this bench in the foremost place immediatelyunder the icons sat barclay de tolly his high forehead merging intohis bald crown he had a st georges cross round his neck and lookedpale and ill he had been feverish for two days and was now shiveringand in pain beside him sat uvarov who with rapid gesticulations wasgiving him some information speaking in low tones as they all didchubby little dokhturov was listening attentively with eyebrows raisedand arms folded on his stomach on the other side sat count ostermanntolstoy seemingly absorbed in his own thoughts his broad head with itsbold features and glittering eyes was resting on his hand raevskitwitching forward the black hair on his temples as was his habitglanced now at kutuzov and now at the door with a look of impatiencekonovnitsyns firm handsome and kindly face was lit up by a tendersly smile his glance met malashas and the expression of his eyescaused the little girl to smilethey were all waiting for bennigsen who on the pretext of inspectingthe position was finishing his savory dinner they waited for him fromfour till six oclock and did not begin their deliberations all thattime but talked in low tones of other mattersonly when bennigsen had entered the hut did kutuzov leave his corner anddraw toward the table but not near enough for the candles that had beenplaced there to light up his facebennigsen opened the council with the question are we to abandonrussias ancient and sacred capital without a struggle or are we todefend it a prolonged and general silence followed there was a frownon every face and only kutuzovs angry grunts and occasional cough brokethe silence all eyes were gazing at him malasha too looked atgranddad she was nearest to him and saw how his face puckered heseemed about to cry but this did not last longrussias ancient and sacred capital he suddenly said repeatingbennigsens words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention to thefalse note in them allow me to tell you your excellency that thatquestion has no meaning for a russian he lurched his heavy bodyforward such a question cannot be put it is senseless the questioni have asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military one thequestion is that of saving russia is it better to give up moscowwithout a battle or by accepting battle to risk losing the army as wellas moscow that is the question on which i want your opinion and hesank back in his chairthe discussion began bennigsen did not yet consider his game lostadmitting the view of barclay and others that a defensive battle at filiwas impossible but imbued with russian patriotism and the love ofmoscow he proposed to move troops from the right to the left flankduring the night and attack the french right flank the following dayopinions were divided and arguments were advanced for and against thatproject ermolov dokhturov and raevski agreed with bennigsen whetherfeeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capitalor guided by other personal considerations these generals seemed notto understand that this council could not alter the inevitable course ofevents and that moscow was in effect already abandoned the othergenerals however understood it and leaving aside the question ofmoscow spoke of the direction the army should take in its retreatmalasha who kept her eyes fixed on what was going on before herunderstood the meaning of the council differently it seemed to her thatit was only a personal struggle between granddad and longcoat asshe termed bennigsen she saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke toone another and in her heart she sided with granddad in the midst ofthe conversation she noticed granddad give bennigsen a quick subtleglance and then to her joys she saw that granddad said something tolongcoat which settled him bennigsen suddenly reddened and pacedangrily up and down the room what so affected him was kutuzovs calmand quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of bennigsensproposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank toattack the french right winggentlemen said kutuzov i cannot approve of the counts plan movingtroops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous and militaryhistory supports that view for instance kutuzov seemed to reflectsearching for an example then with a clear naive look at bennigsen headded oh yes take the battle of friedland which i think the countwell remembers and which was not fully successful only because ourtroops were rearranged too near the enemythere followed a momentary pause which seemed very long to them allthe discussion recommenced but pauses frequently occurred and they allfelt that there was no more to be saidduring one of these pauses kutuzov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing tospeak they all looked at himwell gentlemen i see that it is i who will have to pay for the brokencrockery said he and rising slowly he moved to the table gentlemeni have heard your views some of you will not agree with me but i hepaused by the authority entrusted to me by my sovereign and countryorder a retreatafter that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity andcircumspect silence of people who are leaving after a funeralsome of the generals in low tones and in a strain very different fromthe way they had spoken during the council communicated something totheir commanderinchiefmalasha who had long been expected for supper climbed carefullybackwards down from the oven her bare little feet catching at itsprojections and slipping between the legs of the generals she dartedout of the roomwhen he had dismissed the generals kutuzov sat a long time with hiselbows on the table thinking always of the same terrible questionwhen when did the abandonment of moscow become inevitable when wasthat done which settled the matter and who was to blame for iti did not expect this said he to his adjutant schneider when thelatter came in late that night i did not expect this i did not thinkthis would happenyou should take some rest your serene highness replied schneiderbut no they shall eat horseflesh yet like the turks exclaimedkutuzov without replying striking the table with his podgy fist theyshall too if onlyat that very time in circumstances even more important than retreatingwithout a battle namely the evacuation and burning of moscowrostopchin who is usually represented as being the instigator of thatevent acted in an altogether different manner from kutuzovafter the battle of borodino the abandonment and burning of moscow wasas inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond moscow without fightingevery russian might have predicted it not by reasoning but by thefeeling implanted in each of us and in our fathersthe same thing that took place in moscow had happened in all the townsand villages on russian soil beginning with smolensk without theparticipation of count rostopchin and his broadsheets the peopleawaited the enemy unconcernedly did not riot or become excited or tearanyone to pieces but faced its fate feeling within it the strength tofind what it should do at that most difficult moment and as soon as theenemy drew near the wealthy classes went away abandoning their propertywhile the poorer remained and burned and destroyed what was leftthe consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was andis present in the heart of every russian and a consciousness of thisand a foreboding that moscow would be taken was present in russianmoscow society in  those who had quitted moscow already in july andat the beginning of august showed that they expected this those whowent away taking what they could and abandoning their houses and halftheir belongings did so from the latent patriotism which expressesitself not by phrases or by giving ones children to save the fatherlandand similar unnatural exploits but unobtrusively simply organicallyand therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful resultsit is disgraceful to run away from danger only cowards are runningaway from moscow they were told in his broadsheets rostopchinimpressed on them that to leave moscow was shameful they were ashamedto be called cowards ashamed to leave but still they left knowing ithad to be done why did they go it is impossible to suppose thatrostopchin had scared them by his accounts of horrors napoleon hadcommitted in conquered countries the first people to go away were therich educated people who knew quite well that vienna and berlin hadremained intact and that during napoleons occupation the inhabitantshad spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming frenchmenwhom the russians and especially the russian ladies then liked somuchthey went away because for russians there could be no question as towhether things would go well or ill under french rule in moscow it wasout of the question to be under french rule it would be the worst thingthat could happen they went away even before the battle of borodino andstill more rapidly after it despite rostopchins calls to defend moscowor the announcement of his intention to take the wonderworking icon ofthe iberian mother of god and go to fight or of the balloons that wereto destroy the french and despite all the nonsense rostopchin wrote inhis broadsheets they knew that it was for the army to fight and thatif it could not succeed it would not do to take young ladies and houseserfs to the three hills quarter of moscow to fight napoleon and thatthey must go away sorry as they were to abandon their property todestruction they went away without thinking of the tremendoussignificance of that immense and wealthy city being given over todestruction for a great city with wooden buildings was certain whenabandoned by its inhabitants to be burned they went away each on hisown account and yet it was only in consequence of their going away thatthe momentous event was accomplished that will always remain thegreatest glory of the russian people the lady who afraid of beingstopped by count rostopchins orders had already in june moved with hernegroes and her women jesters from moscow to her saratov estate with avague consciousness that she was not bonapartes servant was reallysimply and truly carrying out the great work which saved russia butcount rostopchin who now taunted those who left moscow and now had thegovernment offices removed now distributed quite useless weapons to thedrunken rabble now had processions displaying the icons and nowforbade father augustin to remove icons or the relics of saints nowseized all the private carts in moscow and on one hundred and thirtysixof them removed the balloon that was being constructed by leppich nowhinted that he would burn moscow and related how he had set fire to hisown house now wrote a proclamation to the french solemnly upbraidingthem for having destroyed his orphanage now claimed the glory of havinghinted that he would burn moscow and now repudiated the deed nowordered the people to catch all spies and bring them to him and nowreproached them for doing so now expelled all the french residents frommoscow and now allowed madame aubertchalme the center of the wholefrench colony in moscow to remain but ordered the venerable oldpostmaster klyucharev to be arrested and exiled for no particularoffense now assembled the people at the three hills to fight the frenchand now to get rid of them handed over to them a man to be killed andhimself drove away by a back gate now declared that he would notsurvive the fall of moscow and now wrote french verses in albumsconcerning his share in the affairthis man did not understand themeaning of what was happening but merely wanted to do something himselfthat would astonish people to perform some patriotically heroic featand like a child he made sport of the momentous and unavoidable eventthe abandonment and burning of moscowand tried with his puny hand nowto speed and now to stay the enormous popular tide that bore him alongwith ithelene having returned with the court from vilna to petersburg foundherself in a difficult positionin petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee whooccupied one of the highest posts in the empire in vilna she had formedan intimacy with a young foreign prince when she returned to petersburgboth the magnate and the prince were there and both claimed theirrights helene was faced by a new problemhow to preserve her intimacywith both without offending eitherwhat would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman didnot cause the least embarrassment to countess bezukhova who evidentlydeserved her reputation of being a very clever woman had she attemptedconcealment or tried to extricate herself from her awkward position bycunning she would have spoiled her case by acknowledging herselfguilty but helene like a really great man who can do whatever hepleases at once assumed her own position to be correct as shesincerely believed it to be and that everyone else was to blamethe first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach her shelifted her beautiful head and half turning to him said firmly thatsjust like a manselfish and cruel i expected nothing else a womansacrifices herself for you she suffers and this is her reward whatright have you monseigneur to demand an account of my attachments andfriendships he is a man who has been more than a father to me theprince was about to say something but helene interrupted himwell yes said she it may be that he has other sentiments for methan those of a father but that is not a reason for me to shut my dooron him i am not a man that i should repay kindness with ingratitudeknow monseigneur that in all that relates to my intimate feelings irender account only to god and to my conscience she concluded layingher hand on her beautiful fully expanded bosom and looking up toheavenbut for heavens sake listen to memarry me and i will be your slavebut thats impossibleyou wont deign to demean yourself by marrying me you said helenebeginning to crythe prince tried to comfort her but helene as if quite distraughtsaid through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marryingthat there were precedents there were up to that time very few but shementioned napoleon and some other exalted personages that she hadnever been her husbands wife and that she had been sacrificedbut the law religion said the prince already yieldingthe law religion what have they been invented for if they cantarrange that said helenethe prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred to himand he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the society of jesuswith whom he was on intimate termsa few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which helene gave ather country house on the stone island the charming monsieur de joberta man no longer young with snow white hair and brilliant black eyes ajesuit a robe courte  was presented to her and in the garden by thelight of the illuminations and to the sound of music talked to her for along time of the love of god of christ of the sacred heart and of theconsolations the one true catholic religion affords in this world andthe next helene was touched and more than once tears rose to her eyesand to those of monsieur de jobert and their voices trembled a dancefor which her partner came to seek her put an end to her discourse withher future directeur de conscience but the next evening monsieur dejobert came to see helene when she was alone and after that often cameagain lay member of the society of jesusone day he took the countess to a roman catholic church where she kneltdown before the altar to which she was led the enchanting middleagedfrenchman laid his hands on her head and as she herself afterwarddescribed it she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into hersoul it was explained to her that this was la graceafter that a longfrocked abbe was brought to her she confessed to himand he absolved her from her sins next day she received a boxcontaining the sacred host which was left at her house for her topartake of a few days later helene learned with pleasure that she hadnow been admitted to the true catholic church and that in a few days thepope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain documentall that was done around her and to her at this time all the attentiondevoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such pleasantrefined ways and the state of dovelike purity she was now in she woreonly white dresses and white ribbons all that time gave her pleasurebut her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to forget her aim andas it always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person getsthe better of cleverer ones helenehaving realized that the mainobject of all these words and all this trouble was after converting herto catholicism to obtain money from her for jesuit institutions as towhich she received indicationsbefore parting with her money insistedthat the various operations necessary to free her from her husbandshould be performed in her view the aim of every religion was merely topreserve certain proprieties while affording satisfaction to humandesires and with this aim in one of her talks with her fatherconfessor she insisted on an answer to the question in how far was shebound by her marriagethey were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room thescent of flowers came in at the window helene was wearing a whitedress transparent over her shoulders and bosom the abbe a wellfedman with a plump cleanshaven chin a pleasant firm mouth and whitehands meekly folded on his knees sat close to helene and with a subtlesmile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at her beautyoccasionally glanced at her face as he explained his opinion on thesubject helene with an uneasy smile looked at his curly hair and hisplump cleanshaven blackish cheeks and every moment expected theconversation to take a fresh turn but the abbe though he evidentlyenjoyed the beauty of his companion was absorbed in his mastery of thematterthe course of the father confessors arguments ran as follows ignorantof the import of what you were undertaking you made a vow of conjugalfidelity to a man who on his part by entering the married state withoutfaith in the religious significance of marriage committed an act ofsacrilege that marriage lacked the dual significance it should havehad yet in spite of this your vow was binding you swerved from itwhat did you commit by so acting a venial or a mortal sin a venialsin for you acted without evil intention if now you married again withthe object of bearing children your sin might be forgiven but thequestion is again a twofold one firstlybut suddenly helene who was getting bored said with one of herbewitching smiles but i think that having espoused the true religion icannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon methe director of her conscience was astounded at having the casepresented to him thus with the simplicity of columbus egg he wasdelighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupils progress but couldnot abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously constructedlet us understand one another countess said he with a smile andbegan refuting his spiritual daughters argumentshelene understood that the question was very simple and easy from theecclesiastical point of view and that her directors were makingdifficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the matterwould be regarded by the secular authoritiesso she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of societyshe provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what shehad told her other suitor that is she put the matter so that the onlyway for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her the elderlymagnate was at first as much taken aback by this suggestion of marriagewith a woman whose husband was alive as the younger man had been buthelenes imperturbable conviction that it was as simple and natural asmarrying a maiden had its effect on him too had helene herself shownthe least sign of hesitation shame or secrecy her cause wouldcertainly have been lost but not only did she show no signs of secrecyor shame on the contrary with goodnatured naivete she told herintimate friends and these were all petersburg that both the princeand the magnate had proposed to her and that she loved both and wasafraid of grieving eithera rumor immediately spread in petersburg not that helene wanted to bedivorced from her husband had such a report spread many would haveopposed so illegal an intention but simply that the unfortunate andinteresting helene was in doubt which of the two men she should marrythe question was no longer whether this was possible but only which wasthe better match and how the matter would be regarded at court therewere it is true some rigid individuals unable to rise to the height ofsuch a question who saw in the project a desecration of the sacramentof marriage but there were not many such and they remained silentwhile the majority were interested in helenes good fortune and in thequestion which match would be the more advantageous whether it wasright or wrong to remarry while one had a husband living they did notdiscuss for that question had evidently been settled by people wiserthan you or me as they said and to doubt the correctness of thatdecision would be to risk exposing ones stupidity and incapacity tolive in societyonly marya dmitrievna akhrosimova who had come to petersburg thatsummer to see one of her sons allowed herself plainly to express anopinion contrary to the general one meeting helene at a ball shestopped her in the middle of the room and amid general silence said inher gruff voice so wives of living men have started marrying againperhaps you think you have invented a novelty you have beenforestalled my dear it was thought of long ago it is done in all thebrothels and with these words marya dmitrievna turning up her widesleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly roundmoved across the roomthough people were afraid of marya dmitrievna she was regarded inpetersburg as a buffoon and so of what she had said they only noticedand repeated in a whisper the one coarse word she had used supposingthe whole sting of her remark to lie in that wordprince vasili who of late very often forgot what he had said andrepeated one and the same thing a hundred times remarked to hisdaughter whenever he chanced to see herhelene i have a

mebilibin puckered his skin in preparation for something wittyeven divorce you said hehelene laughedamong those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposedmarriage was helenes mother princess kuragina she was continuallytormented by jealousy of her daughter and now that jealousy concerned asubject near to her own heart she could not reconcile herself to theidea she consulted a russian priest as to the possibility of divorceand remarriage during a husbands lifetime and the priest told her thatit was impossible and to her delight showed her a text in the gospelwhich as it seemed to him plainly forbids remarriage while the husbandis alivearmed with these arguments which appeared to her unanswerable shedrove to her daughters early one morning so as to find her alonehaving listened to her mothers objections helene smiled blandly andironicallybut it says plainly whosoever shall marry her that is divorcedsaid the old princessah maman ne dites pas de betises vous ne comprenez rien dans maposition jai des devoirs  said helene changing from russian inwhich language she always felt that her case did not sound quite clearinto french which suited it better oh mamma dont talk nonsense you dont understand anything in myposition i have obligationsbut my dearoh mamma how is it you dont understand that the holy father who hasthe right to grant dispensationsjust then the lady companion who lived with helene came in to announcethat his highness was in the ballroom and wished to see hernon diteslui que je ne veux pas le voir que je suis furieuse contrelui parce

he entered the room countess there is mercy for every sinthe old princess rose respectfully and curtsied the young man who hadentered took no notice of her the princess nodded to her daughter andsidled out of the roomyes she is right thought the old princess all her convictionsdissipated by the appearance of his highness she is right but how isit that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it yet it is sosimple she thought as she got into her carriageby the beginning of august helenes affairs were clearly defined and shewrote a letter to her husbandwho as she imagined loved her verymuchinforming him of her intention to marry nn and of her havingembraced the one true faith and asking him to carry out all theformalities necessary for a divorce which would be explained to him bythe bearer of the letterand so i pray god to have you my friend in his holy and powerfulkeepingyour friend helenethis letter was brought to pierres house when he was on the field ofborodinotoward the end of the battle of borodino pierre having run down fromraevskis battery a second time made his way through a gully toknyazkovo with a crowd of soldiers reached the dressing station andseeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on still entangled inthe crowds of soldiersthe one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away quicklyfrom the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that day and returnto ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in his ownbed he felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he beable to understand himself and all he had seen and felt but suchordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be foundthough shells and bullets did not whistle over the road along which hewas going still on all sides there was what there had been on the fieldof battle there were still the same suffering exhausted and sometimesstrangely indifferent faces the same blood the same soldiersovercoats the same sounds of firing which though distant now stillaroused terror and besides this there were the foul air and the dusthaving gone a couple of miles along the mozhaysk road pierre sat downby the roadsidedusk had fallen and the roar of guns died away pierre lay leaning onhis elbow for a long time gazing at the shadows that moved past him inthe darkness he was continually imagining that a cannon ball was flyingtoward him with a terrific whizz and then he shuddered and sat up hehad no idea how long he had been there in the middle of the night threesoldiers having brought some firewood settled down near him and beganlighting a firethe soldiers who threw sidelong glances at pierre got the fire to burnand placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some dried bread andput a little dripping the pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled withthe smell of smoke pierre sat up and sighed the three soldiers wereeating and talking among themselves taking no notice of himand who may you be one of them suddenly asked pierre evidentlymeaning what pierre himself had in mind namely if you want to eatwell give you some food only let us know whether you are an honestmani i said pierre feeling it necessary to minimize his socialposition as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers andbetter understood by them by rights i am a militia officer but my menare not here i came to the battle and have lost themthere now said one of the soldiersanother shook his headwould you like a little mash the first soldier asked and handedpierre a wooden spoon after licking it cleanpierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash as they calledthe food in the cauldron and he thought it more delicious than any foodhe had ever tasted as he sat bending greedily over it helping himselfto large spoonfuls and chewing one after another his face was lit up bythe fire and the soldiers looked at him in silencewhere have you to go to tell us said one of themto mozhayskyoure a gentleman arent youyesand whats your namepeter kirilychwell then peter kirilych come along with us well take you therein the total darkness the soldiers walked with pierre to mozhayskby the time they got near mozhaysk and began ascending the steep hillinto the town the cocks were already crowing pierre went on with thesoldiers quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom of the hilland that he had already passed it he would not soon have rememberedthis such was his state of forgetfulness had he not halfway up thehill stumbled upon his groom who had been to look for him in the townand was returning to the inn the groom recognized pierre in thedarkness by his white hatyour excellency he said why we were beginning to despair how isit you are on foot and where are you going pleaseoh yes said pierrethe soldiers stoppedso youve found your folk said one of them well goodby peterkirilychisnt itgoodbye peter kirilych pierre heard the other voices repeatgoodbye he said and turned with his groom toward the inni ought to give them something he thought and felt in his pocketno better not said another inner voicethere was not a room to be had at the inn they were all occupiedpierre went out into the yard and covering himself up head and all laydown in his carriagescarcely had pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himselffalling asleep but suddenly almost with the distinctness of realityhe heard the boom boom boom of firing the thud of projectiles groansand cries and smelled blood and powder and a feeling of horror anddread of death seized him filled with fright he opened his eyes andlifted his head from under his cloak all was tranquil in the yard onlysomeones orderly passed through the gateway splashing through the mudand talked to the innkeeper above pierres head some pigeons disturbedby the movement he had made in sitting up fluttered under the dark roofof the penthouse the whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peacefulsmell of stable yards delightful to pierre at that moment he could seethe clear starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthousesthank god there is no more of that he thought covering up his headagain oh what a terrible thing is fear and how shamefully i yieldedto it but they they were steady and calm all the time to theend thought hethey in pierres mind were the soldiers those who had been at thebattery those who had given him food and those who had prayed beforethe icon they those strange men he had not previously known stood outclearly and sharply from everyone elseto be a soldier just a soldier thought pierre as he fell asleep toenter communal life completely to be imbued by what makes them whatthey are but how cast off all the superfluous devilish burden of myouter man there was a time when i could have done it i could have runaway from my father as i wanted to or i might have been sent to serveas a soldier after the duel with dolokhov and the memory of the dinnerat the english club when he had challenged dolokhov flashed throughpierres mind and then he remembered his benefactor at torzhok and nowa picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mindit was taking place at the english club and someone near and dear to himsat at the end of the table yes that is he it is my benefactor buthe died thought pierre yes he died and i did not know he wasalive how sorry i am that he died and how glad i am that he is aliveagain on one side of the table sat anatole dolokhov nesvitskidenisov and others like them in his dream the category to which thesemen belonged was as clearly defined in his mind as the category of thosehe termed they and he heard those people anatole and dolokhovshouting and singing loudly yet through their shouting the voice of hisbenefactor was heard speaking all the time and the sound of his wordswas as weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield butpleasant and comforting pierre did not understand what his benefactorwas saying but he knew the categories of thoughts were also quitedistinct in his dream that he was talking of goodness and thepossibility of being what they were and they with their simple kindfirm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides but though they werekindly they did not look at pierre and did not know him wishing tospeak and to attract their attention he got up but at that moment hislegs grew cold and barehe felt ashamed and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloakhad in fact slipped for a moment as he was rearranging his cloak pierreopened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs posts and yard butnow they were all bluish lit up and glittering with frost or dewit is dawn thought pierre but thats not what i want i want tohear and understand my benefactors words again he covered himself upwith his cloak but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was therethere were only thoughts clearly expressed in words thoughts thatsomeone was uttering or that he himself was formulatingafterwards when he recalled those thoughts pierre was convinced thatsomeone outside himself had spoken them though the impressions of thatday had evoked them he had never it seemed to him been able to thinkand express his thoughts like that when awaketo endure war is the most difficult subordination of mans freedom tothe law of god the voice had said simplicity is submission to thewill of god you cannot escape from him and they are simple they donot talk but act the spoken word is silver but the unspoken is goldenman can be master of nothing while he fears death but he who does notfear it possesses all if there were no suffering man would not knowhis limitations would not know himself the hardest thing pierre wenton thinking or hearing in his dream is to be able in your soul tounite the meaning of all to unite all he asked himself no not tounite thoughts cannot be united but to harness all these thoughtstogether is what we need yes one must harness them must harnessthem he repeated to himself with inward rapture feeling that thesewords and they alone expressed what he wanted to say and solved thequestion that tormented himyes one must harness it is time to harnesstime to harness time to harness your excellency your excellencysome voice was repeating we must harness it is time to harnessit was the voice of the groom trying to wake him the sun shonestraight into pierres face he glanced at the dirty innyard in themiddle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pumpwhile carts were passing out of the gate pierre turned away withrepugnance and closing his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage seatno i dont want that i dont want to see and understand that i wantto understand what was revealing itself to me in my dream one secondmore and i should have understood it all but what am i to do harnessbut how can i harness everything and pierre felt with horror that themeaning of all he had seen and thought in the dream had been destroyedthe groom the coachman and the innkeeper told pierre that an officerhad come with news that the french were already near mozhaysk and thatour men were leaving itpierre got up and having told them to harness and overtake him went onfoot through the townthe troops were moving on leaving about ten thousand wounded behindthem there were wounded in the yards at the windows of the houses andthe streets were crowded with them in the streets around carts thatwere to take some of the wounded away shouts curses and blows couldbe heard pierre offered the use of his carriage which had overtakenhim to a wounded general he knew and drove with him to moscow on theway pierre was told of the death of his brotherinlaw anatole and ofthat of prince andrewon the thirteenth of august pierre reached moscow close to the gates ofthe city he was met by count rostopchins adjutantwe have been looking for you everywhere said the adjutant the countwants to see you particularly he asks you to

summervilla at sokolniki the anteroom and reception room of his house werefull of officials who had been summoned or had come for ordersvasilchikov and platov had already seen the count and explained to himthat it was impossible to defend moscow and that it would have to besurrendered though this news was being concealed from the inhabitantsthe officialsthe heads of the various government departmentsknewthat moscow would soon be in the enemys hands just as count rostopchinhimself knew it and to escape personal responsibility they had all cometo the governor to ask how they were to deal with their variousdepartmentsas pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army cameout of rostopchins private roomin answer to questions with which he was greeted the courier made adespairing gesture with his hand and passed through the roomwhile waiting in the reception room pierre with weary eyes watched thevarious officials old and young military and civilian who were therethey all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy pierre went up to a group ofmen one of whom he knew after greeting pierre they continued theirconversationif theyre sent out and brought back again later on it will do no harmbut as things are now one cant answer for anythingbut you see what he writes said another pointing to a printedsheet he held in his handthats another matter thats necessary for the people said thefirstwhat is it asked pierreoh its a fresh broadsheetpierre took it and began readinghis serene highness has passed through mozhaysk in order to join up withthe troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong position wherethe enemy will not soon attack him forty eight guns with ammunitionhave been sent him from here and his serene highness says he willdefend moscow to the

where we willhave some water blessed that will help them to get well quicker itoo am well now one of my eyes was sore but now i am on the lookoutwith bothbut military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in thetown said pierre and that the positionwell of course thats what we were saying replied the firstspeakerand what does he mean by one of my eyes was sore but now i am on thelookout with both asked pierrethe count had a sty replied the adjutant smiling and was very muchupset when i told him people had come to ask what was the matter withhim by the by count he added suddenly addressing pierre with asmile we heard that you have family troubles and that the countessyour wifei have heard nothing pierre replied unconcernedly but what have youheardoh well you know people often invent things i only say what iheardbut what did you hearwell they say continued the adjutant with the same smile that thecountess your wife is preparing to go abroad i expect itsnonsensepossibly remarked pierre looking about him absentmindedly and whois that he asked indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasantovercoat with a big snowwhite beard and eyebrows and a ruddy facehe thats a tradesman that is to say hes the restaurant keepervereshchagin perhaps you have heard of that affair with theproclamationoh so that is vereshchagin said pierre looking at the firm calmface of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a traitorthats not he himself thats the father of the fellow who wrote theproclamation said the adjutant the young man is in prison and iexpect it will go hard with himan old gentleman wearing a star and another official a german wearing across round his neck approached the speakerits a complicated story you know said the adjutant thatproclamation appeared about two months ago the count was informed ofit he gave orders to investigate the matter gabriel ivanovich heremade the inquiries the proclamation had passed through exactly sixtythree hands he asked one from whom did you get it from soandsohe went to the next one from whom did you get it and so on till hereached vereshchagin a half educated tradesman you know a pet of atrader said the adjutant smiling they asked him who gave it youand the point is that we knew whom he had it from he could only havehad it from the postmaster but evidently they had come to someunderstanding he replied from no one i made it up myself theythreatened and questioned him but he stuck to that i made it upmyself and so it was reported to the count who sent for the manfrom whom did you get the proclamation i wrote it myself well youknow the count said the adjutant cheerfully with a smile of pridehe flared up dreadfullyand just think of the fellows audacitylying and obstinacyand the count wanted him to say it was from klyucharev i understandsaid pierrenot at all rejoined the adjutant in dismay klyucharev had his ownsins to answer for without that and that is why he has been banishedbut the point is that the count was much annoyed how could you havewritten it yourself said he and he took up the hamburg gazette thatwas lying on the table here it is you did not write it yourself buttranslated it and translated it abominably because you dont even knowfrench you fool and what do you think no said he i have notread any papers i made it up myself if thats so youre a traitorand ill have you tried and youll be hanged say from whom you hadit i have seen no papers i made it up myself and that was the endof it the count had the father fetched but the fellow stuck to it hewas sent for trial and condemned to hard labor i believe now thefather has come to intercede for him but hes a goodfornothing ladyou know that sort of tradesmans son a dandy and ladykiller heattended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no matchfor him thats the sort of fellow he is his father keeps a cookshophere by the stone bridge and you know there was a large icon of godalmighty painted with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the otherwell he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he dohe found some scoundrel of a painterin the middle of this fresh tale pierre was summoned to the commander inchiefwhen he entered the private room count rostopchin puckering his facewas rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand a short man was sayingsomething but when pierre entered he stopped speaking and went outah how do you do great warrior said rostopchin as soon as the shortman had left the room we have heard of your prowess but thats notthe point between ourselves mon cher do you belong to the masons hewent on severely as though there were something wrong about it which henevertheless intended to pardon pierre remained silent i am wellinformed my friend but i am aware that there are masons and i hopethat you are not one of those who on pretense of saving mankind wish toruin russiayes i am a mason pierre repliedthere you see mon cher i expect you know that messrs speranski andmagnitski have been deported to their proper place mr klyucharev hasbeen treated in the same way and so have others who on the plea ofbuilding up the temple of solomon have tried to destroy the temple oftheir fatherland you can understand that there are reasons for this andthat i could not have exiled the postmaster had he not been a harmfulperson it has now come to my knowledge that you lent him your carriagefor his removal from town and that you have even accepted papers fromhim for safe custody i like you and dont wish you any harm andas youare only half my agei advise you as a father would to cease allcommunication with men of that stamp and to leave here as soon aspossiblebut what did klyucharev do wrong count asked pierrethat is for me to know but not for you to ask shouted rostopchinif he is accused of circulating napoleons proclamation it is notproved that he did so said pierre without looking at rostopchin andvereshchaginthere we are rostopchin shouted at pierre louder than beforefrowning suddenly vereshchagin is a renegade and a traitor who will bepunished as he deserves said he with the vindictive heat with whichpeople speak when recalling an insult but i did not summon you todiscuss my actions but to give you adviceor an order if you preferit i beg you to leave the town and break off all communication withsuch men as klyucharev and i will knock the nonsense out of anybodybut probably realizing that he was shouting at bezukhov who so far wasnot guilty of anything he added taking pierres hand in a friendlymanner we are on the eve of a public disaster and i havent time to bepolite to everybody who has business with me my head is sometimes in awhirl well mon cher what are you doing personallywhy nothing answered pierre without raising his eyes or changing thethoughtful expression of his facethe count frowneda word of friendly advice mon cher be off as soon as you can thatsall i have to tell you happy he who has ears to hear goodbye my dearfellow oh by the by he shouted through the doorway after pierre isit true that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holyfathers of the society of jesuspierre did not answer and left rostopchins room more sullen and angrythan he had ever before shown himselfwhen he reached home it was already getting dark some eight people hadcome to see him that evening the secretary of a committee the colonelof his battalion his steward his majordomo and various petitionersthey all had business with pierre and wanted decisions from him pierredid not understand and was not interested in any of these questions andonly answered them in order to get rid of these people when left aloneat last he opened and read his wifes letterthey the soldiers at the battery prince andrew killed that oldman simplicity is submission to god suffering is necessary themeaning of all one must harness my wife is getting married onemust forget and understand and going to his bed he threw himself onit without undressing and immediately fell asleepwhen he awoke next morning the majordomo came to inform him that aspecial messenger a police officer had come from count rostopchin toknow whether count bezukhov had left or was leaving the towna dozen persons who had business with pierre were awaiting him in thedrawing room pierre dressed hurriedly and instead of going to seethem went to the back porch and out through the gatefrom that time till the end of the destruction of moscow no one ofbezukhovs household despite all the search they made saw pierre againor knew where he wasthe rostovs remained in moscow till the first of september that istill the eve of the enemys entry into the cityafter petya had joined obolenskis regiment of cossacks and left forbelaya tserkov where that regiment was forming the countess was seizedwith terror the thought that both her sons were at the war had bothgone from under her wing that today or tomorrow either or both of themmight be killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances struckher that summer for the first time with cruel clearness she tried toget nicholas back and wished to go herself to join petya or to get himan appointment somewhere in petersburg but neither of these provedpossible petya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless hewas transferred to another regiment on active service nicholas wassomewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his last letterin which he had given a detailed account of his meeting with princessmary the countess did not sleep at night or when she did fall asleepdreamed that she saw her sons lying dead after many consultations andconversations the count at last devised means to tranquillize her hegot petya transferred from obolenskis regiment to bezukhovs which wasin training near moscow though petya would remain in the service thistransfer would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least oneof her sons under her wing and she hoped to arrange matters for herpetya so as not to let him go again but always get him appointed toplaces where he could not possibly take part in a battle as long asnicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved herfirstborn more than all her other children and even reproached herselffor it but when her youngest the scapegrace who had been bad atlessons was always breaking things in the house and making himself anuisance to everybody that snubnosed petya with his merry black eyesand fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to showwhenhe was thrown amid those big dreadful cruel men who were fightingsomewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in itthenhis mother thought she loved him more much more than all her otherchildren the nearer the time came for petya to return the more uneasygrew the countess she began to think she would never live to see suchhappiness the presence of sonya of her beloved natasha or even of herhusband irritated her what do i want with them i want no one butpetya she thoughtat the end of august the rostovs received another letter from nicholashe wrote from the province of voronezh where he had been sent to procureremounts but that letter did not set the countess at ease knowing thatone son was out of danger she became the more anxious about petyathough by the twentieth of august nearly all the rostovs acquaintanceshad left moscow and though everybody tried to persuade the countess toget away as quickly as possible she would not hear of leaving beforeher treasure her adored petya returned on the twentyeighth of augusthe arrived the passionate tenderness with which his mother received himdid not please the sixteenyearold officer though she concealed fromhim her intention of keeping him under her wing petya guessed herdesigns and instinctively fearing that he might give way to emotionwhen with hermight become womanish as he termed it to himselfhetreated her coldly avoided her and during his stay in moscow attachedhimself exclusively to natasha for whom he had always had a particularlybrotherly tenderness almost loverlikeowing to the counts customary carelessness nothing was ready for theirdeparture by the twentyeighth of august and the carts that were to comefrom their ryazan and moscow estates to remove their householdbelongings did not arrive till the thirtiethfrom the twentyeighth till the thirtyfirst all moscow was in a bustleand commotion every day thousands of men wounded at borodino werebrought in by the dorogomilov gate and taken to various parts of moscowand thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessionsout by the other gates in spite of rostopchins broadsheets or becauseof them or independently of them the strangest and most contradictoryrumors were current in the town some said that no one was to be allowedto leave the city others on the contrary said that all the icons hadbeen taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leavesome said there had been another battle after borodino at which thefrench had been routed while others on the contrary reported that therussian army had been destroyed some talked about the moscow militiawhich preceded by the clergy would go to the three hills otherswhispered that augustin had been forbidden to leave that traitors hadbeen seized that the peasants were rioting and robbing people on theirway from moscow and so on but all this was only talk in realitythough the council of fili at which it was decided to abandon moscowhad not yet been held both those who went away and those who remainedbehind felt though they did not show it that moscow would certainly beabandoned and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible andsave their belongings it was felt that everything would suddenly breakup and change but up to the first of september nothing had done so asa criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must dieimmediately but yet looks about him and straightens the cap that isawry on his head so moscow involuntarily continued its wonted lifethough it knew that the time of its destruction was near when theconditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit wouldbe completely upsetduring the three days preceding the occupation of moscow the wholerostov family was absorbed in various activities the head of thefamily count ilya rostov continually drove about the city collectingthe current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty ordersat home about the preparations for their departurethe countess watched the things being packed was dissatisfied witheverything was constantly in pursuit of petya who was always runningaway from her and was jealous of natasha with whom he spent all histime sonya alone directed the practical side of matters by gettingthings packed but of late sonya had been particularly sad and silentnicholas letter in which he mentioned princess mary had elicited inher presence joyous comments from the countess who saw an interventionof providence in this meeting of the princess and nicholasi was never pleased at bolkonskis engagement to natasha said thecountess but i always wanted nicholas to marry the princess and had apresentiment that it would happen what a good thing it would besonya felt that this was true that the only possibility of retrievingthe rostovs affairs was by nicholas marrying a rich woman and that theprincess was a good match it was very bitter for her but despite hergrief or perhaps just because of it she took on herself all thedifficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things andwas busy for whole days the count and countess turned to her when theyhad any orders to give petya and natasha on the contrary far fromhelping their parents were generally a nuisance and a hindrance toeveryone almost all day long the house resounded with their runningfeet their cries and their spontaneous laughter they laughed and weregay not because there was any reason to laugh but because gaiety andmirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was a causefor gaiety and laughter to them petya was in high spirits becausehaving left home a boy he had returned as everybody told him a fineyoung man because he was at home because he had left belaya tserkovwhere there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come tomoscow where there was to be fighting in a few days and chiefly becausenatasha whose lead he always followed was in high spirits natasha wasgay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her ofthe cause of her sadness and because she was feeling well she was alsohappy because she had someone to adore her the adoration of others wasa lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them run freelyand petya adored her above all they were gay because there was a warnear moscow there would be fighting at the town gates arms were beinggiven out everybody was escapinggoing away somewhere and in generalsomething extraordinary was happening and that is always excitingespecially to the youngon saturday the thirtyfirst of august everything in the rostovshouse seemed topsyturvy all the doors were open all the furniture wasbeing carried out or moved about and the mirrors and pictures had beentaken down there were trunks in the rooms and hay wrapping paper andropes were scattered about the peasants and house serfs carrying outthe things were treading heavily on the parquet floors the yard wascrowded with peasant carts some loaded high and already corded upothers still emptythe voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants whohad come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another in theyard and in the house the count had been out since morning thecountess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and waslying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her headpetya was not at home he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meantto obtain a transfer from the militia to the active army sonya was inthe ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china natashawas sitting on the floor of her dismantled room with dresses ribbonsand scarves strewn all about her gazing fixedly at the floor andholding in her hands the old ball dress already out of fashion whichshe had worn at her first petersburg ballnatasha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy andseveral times that morning had tried to set to work but her heart wasnot in it and she could not and did not know how to do anything exceptwith all her heart and all her might for a while she had stood besidesonya while the china was being packed and tried to help but soon gaveit up and went to her room to pack her own things at first she found itamusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids but when that wasdone and what was left had still to be packed she found it dulldunyasha you pack you will wont you dear and when dunyashawillingly promised to do it all for her natasha sat down on the floortook her old ball dress and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to whatought to have occupied her thoughts now she was roused from her reverieby the talk of the maids in the next room which was theirs and by thesound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch natasha got upand looked out of the window an enormously long row of carts full ofwounded men had stopped in the streetthe housekeeper the old nurse the cooks coachmen maids footmenpostilions and scullions stood at the gate staring at the woundednatasha throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holdingan end of it in each hand went out into the streetthe former housekeeper old mavra kuzminichna had stepped out of thecrowd by the gate gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bastmats and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside natashamoved a few steps forward and stopped shyly still holding herhandkerchief and listened to what the housekeeper was sayingthen you have nobody in moscow she was saying you would be morecomfortable somewhere in a house in ours for instance the familyare leavingi dont know if it would be allowed replied the officer in a weakvoice here is our commanding officer ask him and he pointed to astout major who was walking back along the street past the row of cartsnatasha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officerand at once went to meet the majormay the wounded men stay in our house she askedthe major raised his hand to his cap with a smilewhich one do you want maamselle said he screwing up his eyes andsmilingnatasha quietly repeated her question and her face and whole mannerwere so serious though she was still holding the ends of herhandkerchief that the major ceased smiling and after some reflectionas if considering in how far the thing was possiblereplied in theaffirmativeoh yes why not they may he saidwith a slight inclination of her head natasha stepped back quickly tomavra kuzminichna who stood talking compassionately to the officerthey may he says they may whispered natashathe cart in which the officer lay was turned into the rostovs yard anddozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of thetownsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of thehouses in povarskaya street natasha was evidently pleased to be dealingwith new people outside the ordinary routine of her life she and mavrakuzminichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into theiryardyour papa must be told though said mavra kuzminichnanever mind never mind what does it matter for one day we can moveinto the drawing room they can have all our half of the housethere now young lady you do take things into your head even if weput them into the wing the mens room or the nurses room we must askpermissionwell ill asknatasha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the halfopen doorinto the sitting room where there was a smell of vinegar and hoffmansdropsare you asleep mammaoh what sleep said the countess waking up just as she was droppinginto a dozemamma darling said natasha kneeling by her mother and bringing herface close to her mothers i am sorry forgive me ill never do itagain i woke you up mavra kuzminichna has sent me they have broughtsome wounded hereofficers will you let them come they have nowhereto go i knew youd let them come she said quickly all in one breathwhat officers whom have they brought i dont understand anythingabout it said the countessnatasha laughed and the countess too smiled slightlyi knew youd give permission so ill tell them and having kissedher mother natasha got up and went to the doorin the hall she met her father who had returned with bad newsweve stayed too long said the count with involuntary vexation theclub is closed and the police are leavingpapa is it all rightive invited some of the wounded into thehouse said natashaof course it is he answered absently thats not the point i begyou not to indulge in trifles now but to help to pack and tomorrow wemust go go goand the count gave a similar order to the majordomo and the servantsat dinner petya having returned home told them the news he had heard hesaid the people had been getting arms in the kremlin and that thoughrostopchins broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or threedays in advance the order had certainly already been given for everyoneto go armed to the three hills tomorrow and that there would be a bigbattle therethe countess looked with timid horror at her sons eager excited faceas he said this she realized that if she said a word about his notgoing to the battle she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impendingengagement he would say something about men honor and the fatherlandsomething senseless masculine and obstinate which there would be nocontradicting and her plans would be spoiled and so hoping to arrangeto leave before then and take petya with her as their protector anddefender she did not answer him but after dinner called the countaside and implored him with tears to take her away quickly that verynight if possible with a womans involuntary loving cunning she whotill then had not shown any alarm said that she would die of fright ifthey did not leave that very night without any pretense she was nowafraid of everythingmadame schoss who had been out to visit her daughter increased thecountess fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spiritdealers in myasnitski street when returning by that street she hadbeen unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of theshop

moment she at once set to work afresh and they now trusted hercompletely the count was not angry even when they told him that natashahad countermanded an order of his and the servants now came to her toask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded and whether it might becorded up thanks to natashas directions the work now went onexpeditiously unnecessary things were left and the most valuablepacked as compactly as possiblebut hard as they all worked till quite late that night they could notget everything packed the countess had fallen asleep and the counthaving put off their departure till next

the yard and stoppedbeside mavra kuzminichnao lord jesus christ she murmuredshe invited them to take the wounded man into the housethe masters wont object she saidbut they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs and so they took himinto the wing and put him in the room that had been madame schossthis wounded man was prince andrew bolkonskimoscows last day had come it was a clear bright autumn day a sundaythe church bells everywhere were ringing for service just as usual onsundays nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the cityonly two things indicated the social condition of moscowthe rabblethat is the poor people and the price of commodities an enormous crowdof factory hands house serfs and peasants with whom some officialsseminarists and gentry were mingled had gone early that morning to thethree hills having waited there for rostopchin who did not turn upthey became convinced that moscow would be surrendered and thendispersed all about the town to the public houses and cookshops pricestoo that day indicated the state of affairs the price of weapons ofgold of carts and horses kept rising but the value of paper money andcity articles kept falling so that by midday there were instances ofcarters removing valuable goods such as cloth and receiving in paymenta half of what they carted while peasant horses were fetching fivehundred rubles each and furniture mirrors and bronzes were beinggiven away for nothingin the rostovs staid oldfashioned house the dissolution of formerconditions of life was but little noticeable as to the serfs the onlyindication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared duringthe night but nothing was stolen and as to the value of theirpossessions the thirty peasant carts that had come in from theirestates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable andthey were offered enormous sums of money for them not only were hugesums offered for the horses and carts but on the previous evening andearly in the morning of the first of september orderlies and servantssent by wounded officers came to the rostovs and wounded men draggedthemselves there from the rostovs and from neighboring houses wherethey were accommodated entreating the servants to try to get them alift out of moscow the majordomo to whom these entreaties wereaddressed though he was sorry for the wounded resolutely refusedsaying that he dare not even mention the matter to the count pity thesewounded men as one might it was evident that if they were given onecart there would be no reason to refuse another or all the carts andones own carriages as well thirty carts could not save all the woundedand in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and onesown family so thought the majordomo on his masters behalfon waking up that morning count ilya rostov left his bedroom softly soas not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morningand came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown in the yardstood the carts ready corded the carriages were at the front porch themajordomo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to apale young officer with a bandaged arm on seeing the count the majordomo made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go awaywell vasilich is everything ready asked the count and stroking hisbald head he looked goodnaturedly at the officer and the orderly andnodded to them he liked to see new faceswe can harness at once your excellencywell thats right as soon as the countess wakes well be off godwilling what is it gentlemen he added turning to the officer areyou staying in my housethe officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimsoncount be so good as to allow me for gods sake to get into somecorner of one of your carts i have

be very pleasedvery pleased vasilich youll see to it just unload one or two cartswell what of it do whats necessary said the count mutteringsome indefinite orderbut at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officersface had already sealed the order the count looked around him in theyard at the gates at the window of the wings wounded officers andtheir orderlies were to be seen they were all looking at the count andmoving toward the porchplease step into the gallery your excellency said the majordomowhat are your orders about the picturesthe count went into the house with him repeating his order not torefuse the wounded who asked for a liftwell never mind some of the things can be unloaded he added in asoft confidential voice as though afraid of being overheardat nine oclock the countess woke up and matrena timofeevna who hadbeen her ladys maid before her marriage and now performed a sort ofchief gendarmes duty for her came to say that madame schoss was muchoffended and the young ladies summer dresses could not be left behindon inquiry the countess learned that madame schoss was offended becauseher trunk had been taken down from its cart and all the loads werebeing uncorded and the luggage taken out of the carts to make room forwounded men whom the count in the simplicity of his heart had orderedthat they should take with them the countess sent for her husbandwhat is this my dear i hear that the luggage is being unloadedyou know love i wanted to tell you countess dear an officercame to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded after all ours arethings that can be bought but think what being left behind means tothem really now in our own yardwe asked them in ourselves andthere are officers among them you know i think my dear let thembe taken wheres the hurrythe count spoke timidly as he always did when talking of money mattersthe countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news ofsomething detrimental to the childrens interests such as the buildingof a new gallery or conservatory the inauguration of a private theateror an orchestra she was accustomed always to oppose anything announcedin that timid tone and considered it her duty to do soshe assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husbandlisten to me count you have managed matters so that we are gettingnothing for the house and now you wish to throw away all ourall thechildrens property you said yourself that we have a hundred thousandrubles worth of things in the house i dont consent my dear i dontdo as you please its the

the count throughtears of joy and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide her look ofshame on his breastpapa mamma may i see to it may i asked natasha we will stilltake all the most necessary thingsthe count nodded affirmatively and natasha at the rapid pace at whichshe used to run when playing at tag ran through the ballroom to theanteroom and downstairs into the yardthe servants gathered round natasha but could not believe the strangeorder she brought them until the count himself in his wifes nameconfirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take thetrunks to the storerooms when they understood that order the servantsset to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal it no longer seemedstrange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that couldbe done just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strangeto anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods cartedaway but that had seemed the only thing to dothe whole household as if to atone for not having done it sooner seteagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts thewounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale buthappy faces round the carts the news that carts were to be had spreadto the neighboring houses from which wounded men began to come into therostovs yard many of the wounded asked them not to unload the cartsbut only to let them sit on the top of the things but the work ofunloading once started could not be arrested it seemed not to matterwhether all or only half the things were left behind cases full ofchina bronzes pictures and mirrors that had been so carefully packedthe night before now lay about the yard and still they went onsearching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that andletting the wounded have another and yet another cartwe can take four more men said the steward they can have my trapor else what is to become of themlet them have my wardrobe cart said the countess dunyasha can gowith me in the carriagethey unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from ahouse two doors off the whole household servants included was brightand animated natasha was in a state of rapturous excitement such as shehad not known for a long timewhat could we fasten this onto asked the servants trying to fix atrunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage we must keep at leastone cartwhats in it asked natashathe counts booksleave it vasilich will put it away its not wantedthe phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where countpeter could siton the box youll sit on the box wont you petya cried natashasonya too was busy all this time but the aim of her efforts was quitedifferent from natashas she was putting away the things that had to beleft behind and making a list of them as the countess wished and shetried to get as much taken away with them as possiblebefore two oclock in the afternoon the rostovs four carriages packedfull and with the horses harnessed stood at the front door one by onethe carts with the wounded had moved out of the yardthe caleche in which prince andrew was being taken attracted sonyasattention as it passed the front porch with the help of a maid she wasarranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that stood atthe entrancewhose caleche is that she inquired leaning out of the carriagewindowwhy didnt you know miss replied the maid the wounded prince hespent the night in our house and is going with usbut who is it whats his nameits our intended that wasprince bolkonski himself they say he isdying replied the maid with a sighsonya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess the countesstired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey waspacing up and down the drawing room waiting for the household toassemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before startingnatasha was not in the roommamma said sonya prince andrew is here mortally wounded he isgoing with usthe countess opened her eyes in dismay and seizing sonyas arm glancedaroundnatasha she murmuredat that moment this news had only one significance for both of themthey knew their natasha and alarm as to what would happen if she heardthis news stifled all sympathy for the man they both likednatasha does not know yet but he is going with us said sonyayou say he is dyingsonya noddedthe countess put her arms around sonya and began to crythe ways of god are past finding out she thought feeling that thealmighty hand hitherto unseen was becoming manifest in all that wasnow taking placewell mamma everything is ready whats the matter asked natasha aswith animated face she ran into the roomnothing answered the countess if everything is ready let us startand the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face sonyaembraced natasha and kissed hernatasha looked at her inquiringlywhat is it what has happenednothing nois it something very bad for me what is it persisted natasha withher quick intuitionsonya sighed and made no reply the count petya madame schoss mavrakuzminichna and vasilich came into the drawing room and having closedthe doors they all sat down and remained for some moments silentlyseated without looking at one anotherthe count was the first to rise and with a loud sigh crossed himselfbefore the icon all the others did the same then the count embracedmavra kuzminichna and vasilich who were to remain in moscow and whilethey caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backslightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words thecountess went into the oratory and there sonya found her on her kneesbefore the icons that had been left here and there hanging on the wallthe most precious ones with which some family tradition was connectedwere being taken with themin the porch and in the yard the men whom petya had armed with swordsand daggers with trousers tucked inside their high boots and with beltsand girdles tightened were taking leave of those remaining behindas is always the case at a departure much had been forgotten or put inthe wrong place and for a long time two menservants stood one on eachside of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help thecountess in while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the houseto the carriages the caleche the phaeton and back againthey always will forget everything said the countess dont you knowi cant sit like thatand dunyasha with clenched teeth without replying but with anaggrieved look on her face hastily got into the coach to rearrange theseatoh those servants said the count swaying his headefim the old coachman who was the only one the countess trusted todrive her sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as glanceround at what was going on behind him from thirty years experience heknew it would be some time yet before the order be off in godsname would be given him and he knew that even when it was said hewould be stopped once or twice more while they sent back to fetchsomething that had been forgotten and even after that he would again bestopped and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beghim for the love of heaven to drive carefully down the hill he knew allthis and therefore waited calmly for what would happen with morepatience than the horses especially the near one the chestnut falconwho was pawing the ground and champing his bit at last all were seatedthe carriage steps were folded and pulled up the door was shutsomebody was sent for a traveling case and the countess leaned out andsaid what she had to say then efim deliberately doffed his hat andbegan crossing himself the postilion and all the other servants did thesame off in gods name said efim putting on his hat start thepostilion started the horses the off pole horse tugged at his collarthe high springs creaked and the body of the coach swayed the footmansprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed out ofthe yard onto the uneven roadway the other vehicles jolted in theirturn and the procession of carriages moved up the street in thecarriages the caleche and the phaeton all crossed themselves as theypassed the church opposite the house those who were to remain in moscowwalked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers offrarely had natasha experienced so joyful a feeling as now sitting inthe carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding wallsof forsaken agitated moscow occasionally she leaned out of thecarriage window and looked back and then forward at the long train ofwounded in front of them almost at the head of the line she could seethe raised hood of prince andrews caleche she did not know who was init but each time she looked at the procession her eyes sought thatcaleche she knew it was right in frontin kudrino from the nikitski presnya and podnovinsk streets cameseveral other trains of vehicles similar to the rostovs and as theypassed along the sadovaya street the carriages and carts formed two rowsabreastas they were going round the sukharev water tower natasha who wasinquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walkingpast suddenly cried out in joyful surprisedear me mamma sonya look its hewho wholook yes on my word its bezukhov said natasha putting her headout of the carriage and staring at a tall stout man in a coachmanslong coat who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently agentleman in disguise and who was passing under the arch of thesukharev tower accompanied by a small sallowfaced beardless old manin a frieze coatyes it really is bezukhov in a coachmans coat with a queerlookingold boy really said natasha look lookno its not he how can you talk such nonsensemamma screamed natasha ill stake my head its he i assure youstop stop she cried to the coachmanbut the coachman could not stop for from the meshchanski street camemore carts and carriages and the rostovs were being shouted at to moveon and not block the wayin fact however though now much farther off than before the rostovsall saw pierreor someone extraordinarily like himin a coachmanscoat going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside asmall beardless old man who looked like a footman that old man noticeda face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them andrespectfully touching pierres elbow said something to him and pointedto the carriage pierre evidently engrossed in thought could not atfirst understand him at length when he had understood and looked in thedirection the old man indicated he recognized natasha and followinghis first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach buthaving taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stoppednatashas face leaning out of the window beamed with quizzicalkindlinesspeter kirilovich come here we have recognized you this iswonderful she cried holding out her hand to him what are you doingwhy are you like thispierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walkedalong beside her while the coach still moved onwhat is the matter count asked the countess in a surprised andcommiserating tonewhat what why dont ask me said pierre and looked round atnatasha whose radiant happy expressionof which he was consciouswithout looking at herfilled him with enchantmentare you remaining in moscow thenpierre hesitatedin moscow he said in a questioning tone yes in moscow goodbyeah if only i were a man id certainly stay with you how splendidsaid natasha

muttered its an awful time and droppingbehind the carriage he stepped onto the pavementnatasha continued to lean out of the window for a long time beaming athim with her kindly slightly quizzical happy smilefor the last two days ever since leaving home pierre had been livingin the empty house of his deceased benefactor bazdeev this is how ithappenedwhen he woke up on the morning after his return to moscow and hisinterview with count rostopchin he could not for some time make outwhere he was and what was expected of him when he was informed thatamong others awaiting him in his reception room there was a frenchmanwho had brought a letter from his wife the countess helene he feltsuddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and hopelessness to whichhe was apt to succumb he felt that everything was now at an end allwas in confusion and crumbling to pieces that nobody was right orwrong the future held nothing and there was no escape from thisposition smiling unnaturally and muttering to himself he first satdown on the sofa in an attitude of despair then rose went to the doorof the reception room and peeped through the crack returned flourishinghis arms and took up a book his majordomo came in a second time tosay that the frenchman who had brought the letter from the countess wasvery anxious to see him if only for a minute and that someone frombazdeevs widow had called to ask pierre to take charge of her husbandsbooks as she herself was leaving for the countryoh yes in a minute wait or no no of course go and say i willcome directly pierre replied to the majordomobut as soon as the man had left the room pierre took up his hat whichwas lying on the table and went out of his study by the other doorthere was no one in the passage he went along the whole length of thispassage to the stairs and frowning and rubbing his forehead with bothhands went down as far as the first landing the hall porter wasstanding at the front door from the landing where pierre stood therewas a second staircase leading to the back entrance he went down thatstaircase and out into the yard no one had seen him but there weresome carriages waiting and as soon as pierre stepped out of the gatethe coachmen and the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps tohim when he felt he was being looked at he behaved like an ostrichwhich hides its head in a bush in order not to be seen he hung his headand quickening his pace went down the streetof all the affairs awaiting pierre that day the sorting of josephbazdeevs books and papers appeared to him the most necessaryhe hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to thepatriarchs ponds where the widow bazdeevs house wascontinually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that weremaking their way from all sides out of moscow and balancing his bulkybody so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle pierreexperiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school began totalk to his driverthe man told him that arms were being distributed today at the kremlinand that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the three hillsgates and a great battle would be fought therehaving reached the patriarchs ponds pierre found the bazdeevs housewhere he had not been for a long time past he went up to the gategerasim that sallow beardless old man pierre had seen at torzhok fiveyears before with joseph

even asking himself what they were wanted forhe procured acoachmans coat and cap for pierre and promised to get him the pistolnext day makar alexeevich came twice that evening shuffling along inhis galoshes as far as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly atpierre but as soon as pierre turned toward him he wrapped his dressinggown around him with a shamefaced and angry look and hurried away itwas when pierre wearing the coachmans coat which gerasim had procuredfor him and had disinfected by steam was on his way with the old man tobuy the pistol at the sukharev market that he met the rostovskutuzovs order to retreat through moscow to the ryazan road was issuedat night on the first of septemberthe first troops started at once and during the night they marchedslowly and steadily without hurry at daybreak however those nearingthe town at the dorogomilov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldierscrowding and hurrying across the bridge ascending on the opposite sideand blocking the streets and alleys while endless masses of troops werebearing down on them from behind and an unreasoning hurry and alarmovercame them they all rushed forward to the bridge onto it and tothe fords and the boats kutuzov himself had driven round by sidestreets to the other side of moscowby ten oclock in the morning of the second of september only the rearguard remained in the dorogomilov suburb where they had ample room themain army was on the other side of moscow or beyond itat that very time at ten in the morning of the second of septembernapoleon was standing among his troops on the poklonny hill looking atthe panorama spread out before him from the twentysixth of august tothe second of september that is from the battle of borodino to theentry of the french into moscow during the whole of that agitatingmemorable week there had been the extraordinary autumn weather thatalways comes as a surprise when the sun hangs low and gives more heatthan in spring when everything shines so brightly in the rare clearatmosphere that the eyes smart when the lungs are strengthened andrefreshed by inhaling the aromatic autumn air when even the nights arewarm and when in those dark warm nights golden stars startle anddelight us continually by falling from the skyat ten in the morning of the second of september this weather stillheldthe brightness of the morning was magical moscow seen from the poklonnyhill lay spaciously spread out with her river her gardens and herchurches and she seemed to be living her usual life her cupolasglittering like stars in the sunlightthe view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture such as hehad never seen before filled napoleon with the rather envious anduneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that hasno knowledge of them this city was evidently living with the full forceof its own life by the indefinite signs which even at a distancedistinguish a living body from a dead one napoleon from the poklonnyhill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt as it were thebreathing of that great and beautiful bodyevery russian looking at moscow feels her to be a mother everyforeigner who sees her even if ignorant of her significance as themother city must feel her feminine character and napoleon felt itcette ville asiatique aux innombrables eglises moscou la sainte lavoila done enfin cette fameuse ville il etait temps  said he anddismounting he ordered a plan of moscow to be spread out before him andsummoned lelorgne dideville the interpreter that asiatic city of the innumerable churches holy moscow here itis then at last that famous city it was high timea town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honorthought he he had said so to tuchkov at smolensk from that point ofview he gazed at the oriental beauty he had not seen before it seemedstrange to him that his longfelt wish which had seemed unattainablehad at last been realized in the clear morning light he gazed now atthe city and now at the plan considering its details and the assuranceof possessing it agitated and awed himbut could it be otherwise he thought here is this capital at myfeet where is alexander now and of what is he thinking a strangebeautiful and majestic city and a strange and majestic moment in whatlight must i appear to them thought he thinking of his troops hereshe is the reward for all those fainthearted men he reflectedglancing at those near him and at the troops who were approaching andforming up one word from me one movement of my hand and that ancientcapital of the tsars would perish but my clemency is always ready todescend upon the vanquished i must be magnanimous and truly great butno it cant be true that i am in moscow he suddenly thought yethere she is lying at my feet with her golden domes and crossesscintillating and twinkling in the sunshine but i shall spare her onthe ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism i will inscribe greatwords of justice and mercy it is just this which alexander will feelmost painfully i know him it seemed to napoleon that the chiefimport of what was taking place lay in the personal struggle betweenhimself and alexander from the height of the kremlinyes there isthe kremlin yesi will give them just laws i will teach them themeaning of true civilization i will make generations of boyars remembertheir conqueror with love i will tell the deputation that i did notand do not desire war that i have waged war only against the falsepolicy of their court that i love and respect alexander and that inmoscow i will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people ido not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honoredmonarch boyars i will say to them i do not desire war i desirethe peace and welfare of all my subjects however i know theirpresence will inspire me and i shall speak to them as i always doclearly impressively and majestically but can it be true that i am inmoscow yes there she liesquon mamene les boyars  said he to his suite bring the boyars to mea general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch theboyarstwo hours passed napoleon had lunched and was again standing in thesame place on the poklonny hill awaiting the deputation his speech tothe boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination thatspeech was full of dignity and greatness as napoleon understood ithe was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended toadopt toward moscow in his imagination he appointed days for assembliesat the palace of the tsars at which russian notables and his own wouldmingle he mentally appointed a governor one who would win the heartsof the people having learned that there were many charitableinstitutions in moscow he mentally decided that he would shower favorson them all he thought that as in africa he had to put on a burnooseand sit in a mosque so in moscow he must be beneficent like the tsarsand in order finally to touch the hearts of the russiansand being likeall frenchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental without a referenceto ma chere ma tendre ma pauvre mere  he decided that he wouldplace an inscription on all these establishments in large letters thisestablishment is dedicated to my dear mother or no it should besimply maison de ma mere  he concluded but am i really inmoscow yes here it lies before me but why is the deputation from thecity so long in appearing he wondered my dear my tender my poor mother  house of my mothermeanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispersamong his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite those sent tofetch the deputation had returned with the news that moscow was emptythat everyone had left it the faces of those who were not conferringtogether were pale and perturbed they were not alarmed by the fact thatmoscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants grave as that factseemed but by the question how to tell the emperorwithout puttinghim in the terrible position of appearing ridiculousthat he had beenawaiting the boyars so long in vain that there were drunken mobs leftin moscow but no one else some said that a deputation of some sort mustbe scraped together others disputed that opinion and maintained thatthe emperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared and thentold the truthhe will have to be told all the same said some gentlemen of thesuite but gentlementhe position was the more awkward because the emperor meditating uponhis magnanimous plans was pacing patiently up and down before theoutspread map occasionally glancing along the road to moscow from underhis lifted hand with a bright and proud smilebut its impossible declared the gentlemen of the suite shruggingtheir shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied wordleridiculeat last the emperor tired of futile expectation his actors instinctsuggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too long drawn outwas beginning to lose its sublimity gave a sign with his hand a singlereport of a signaling gun followed and the troops who were alreadyspread out on different sides of moscow moved into the city throughtver kaluga and dorogomilov gates faster and faster vying with oneanother they moved at the double or at a trot vanishing amid theclouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roarof mingling shoutsdrawn on by the movement of his troops napoleon rode with them as far asthe dorogomilov gate but there again stopped and dismounting from hishorse paced for a long time by the kammerkollezski rampart awaitingthe deputationmeanwhile moscow was empty there were still people in it perhaps afiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained but it was emptyit was empty

a disconnected buzzing fromdifferent parts of the deserted hive from the alighting board insteadof the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom and the warmwhiffs of crowded life comes an odor of emptiness and decay minglingwith the smell of honey there are no longer sentinels sounding thealarm with their abdomens raised and ready to die in defense of thehive there is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing activitylike the sound of boiling water but diverse discordant sounds ofdisorder in and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared withhoney fly timidly and shiftily they do not sting but crawl away fromdanger formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the hive and theyflew out empty now they fly out laden the beekeeper opens the lowerpart of the hive

drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately invarious directions on the floor and walls of the hive instead of aneatly glued floor swept by the bees with the fanning of their wingsthere is a floor

front of the kammerkollezski rampartawaiting what to his mind was a necessary if but formal observance ofthe proprietiesa deputationin various corners of moscow there still remained a few people aimlesslymoving about following their old habits and hardly aware of what theywere doingwhen with due circumspection napoleon was informed that moscow wasempty he looked angrily at his informant turned away and silentlycontinued to walk to and fromy carriage he saidhe took his seat beside the aidedecamp on duty and drove into thesuburb moscow deserted he said to himself what an incredibleeventhe did not drive into the town but put up at an inn in the dorogomilovsuburbthe coup de theatre had not come offthe russian troops were passing through moscow from two oclock at nighttill two in the afternoon and bore away with them the wounded and thelast of the inhabitants who were leavingthe greatest crush during the movement of the troops took place at thestone moskva and yauza bridgeswhile the troops dividing into two parts when passing around thekremlin were thronging the moskva and the stone bridges a great manysoldiers taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion turned backfrom the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church ofvasili the beatified and under the borovitski gate back up the hill tothe red square where some instinct told them they could easily takethings not belonging to them crowds of the kind seen at cheap salesfilled all the passages and alleys of the bazaar but there were nodealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers toenter there were no hawkers nor the usual motley crowd of femalepurchasersbut only soldiers in uniforms and overcoats though withoutmuskets entering the bazaar emptyhanded and silently making their wayout through its passages with bundles tradesmen and their assistantsof whom there were but few moved about among the soldiers quitebewildered they unlocked their shops and locked them up again andthemselves carried goods away with the help of their assistants on thesquare in front of the bazaar were drummers beating the muster call butthe roll of the drums did not make the looting soldiers run in thedirection of the drum as formerly but made them on the contrary runfarther away among the soldiers in the shops and passages some men wereto be seen in gray coats with closely shaven heads two officers onewith a scarf over his uniform and mounted on a lean darkgray horsethe other in an overcoat and on foot stood at the corner of ilyinkastreet

came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven head wasflung out violentlythis man bent double rushed past the tradesman and the officer theofficer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops but at thatmoment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the moskvabridge and the officer ran out into the squarewhat is it what is it he asked but his comrade was alreadygalloping off past vasili the beatified in the direction from which thescreams camethe officer mounted his horse and rode after him when he reached thebridge he saw two unlimbered guns the infantry crossing the bridgeseveral overturned carts and frightened and laughing faces among thetroops beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses wereharnessed four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheelsthe cart was loaded high and at the very top beside a childs chairwith its legs in the air sat a peasant woman uttering piercing anddesperate shrieks he was told by his fellow officers that the screamsof the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact thatgeneral ermolov coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers weredispersing among the shops while crowds of civilians blocked the bridgehad ordered two guns to be unlimbered and made a show of firing at thebridge the crowd crushing one another upsetting carts and shoutingand squeezing desperately had cleared off the bridge and the troopswere now moving forwardmeanwhile the city itself was deserted there was hardly anyone in thestreets the gates and shops were all closed only here and there roundthe taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be heard nobodydrove through the streets and footsteps were rarely heard thepovarskaya was quite still and deserted the huge courtyard of therostovs house was littered with wisps of hay and with dung from thehorses and not a soul was to be seen there in the great drawing roomof the house which had been left with all it contained were twopeople they were the yard porter ignat and the page boy mishkavasilichs grandson who had stayed in moscow with his grandfathermishka had opened the clavichord and was strumming on it with onefinger

closed gate for some time with moisteyes pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected flow ofmotherly tenderness and pity for the unknown young officerfrom an unfinished house on the varvarka the ground floor of which wasa dramshop came drunken shouts and songs on benches round the tablesin a dirty little room sat some ten factory hands tipsy and perspiringwith dim eyes and wideopen mouths they were all laboriously singingsome song or other they were singing discordantly arduously and withgreat effort evidently not because they wished to sing but becausethey wanted to show they were drunk and on a spree one a tall fairhaired lad in a clean blue coat was standing over the others his facewith its fine straight nose would have been handsome had it not been forhis thin compressed twitching lips and dull gloomy fixed eyesevidently possessed by some idea he stood over those who were singingand solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white arm withthe sleeve turned up to the elbow trying unnaturally to spread out hisdirty fingers the sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he alwayscarefully rolled it up again with his left hand as if it were mostimportant that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing should be barein the midst of the song cries were heard and fighting and blows in thepassage and porch the tall lad waved his armstop it he exclaimed peremptorily theres a fight lads andstill rolling up his sleeve he went out to the porchthe factory hands followed him these men who under the leadership ofthe tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning had brought thepublican some skins from the factory and for this had had drink servedthem the blacksmiths from a neighboring smithy hearing the sounds ofrevelry in the tavern and supposing it to have been broken into wishedto force their way in too and a fight in the porch had resultedthe publican was fighting one of the smiths at the door and when theworkmen came out the smith wrenching himself free from the tavernkeeper fell face downward on the pavementanother smith tried to enter the doorway pressing against the publicanwith his chestthe lad with the turnedup sleeve gave the smith a blow in the face andcried wildly theyre fighting us ladsat that moment the first smith got up and scratching his bruised faceto make it bleed shouted in a tearful voice police

publican and the tall youngfellow repeated one after the other and they moved up the streettogetherthe bloodstained smith went beside them the factory hands and othersfollowed behind talking and shoutingat the corner of the moroseyka opposite a large house with closedshutters and bearing a bootmakers signboard stood a score of thinwornout gloomyfaced bootmakers wearing overalls and long

was reading the broadsheet of august  whenthe crowd collected round him he seemed confused but at the demand ofthe tall lad who had pushed his way up to him he began in a rathertremulous voice to read the sheet from the beginningearly tomorrow i shall go to his serene highness he read sirinhighness said the tall fellow with a triumphant smile on his lips anda frown on his brow to consult with him

the highest authority shouldnot saythey all stood despondent and silent the tall youth moved his lips andswayed from side to sidewe should ask him thats he himself yes ask him indeedwhy not hell explain voices in the rear of the crowd were suddenlyheard saying and the general attention turned to the policesuperintendents trap which drove into the square attended by twomounted dragoonsthe superintendent of police who had gone that morning by countrostopchins orders to burn the barges and had in connection with thatmatter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in hispocket on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman tostopwhat people are these he shouted to the men who were moving singlyand timidly in the direction of his trapwhat people are

shouteddifferent people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trapfollowing the superintendent of police and talking loudly the crowd wentin the direction of the lubyanka streetthere now the gentry and merchants have gone away and left us toperish do they think were dogs voices in the crowd were heard sayingmore and more frequentlyon the evening of the first of september after his interview withkutuzov count rostopchin had returned to moscow mortified and offendedbecause he had not been invited to attend the council of war andbecause kutuzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in thedefense of the city amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him atthe camp which treated the tranquillity of the capital and itspatriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite irrelevant andunimportant matters distressed offended and surprised by all thisrostopchin had returned to moscow after supper he lay down on a sofawithout undressing and was awakened soon after midnight by a courierbringing him a letter from kutuzov this letter requested the count tosend police officers to guide the troops through the town as the armywas retreating to the ryazan road beyond moscow this was not news torostopchin he had known that moscow would be abandoned not merely sincehis interview the previous day with kutuzov on the poklonny hill butever since the battle of borodino for all the generals who came tomoscow after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible tofight another battle and since then the government property had beenremoved every night and half the inhabitants had left the city withrostopchins own permission yet all the same this informationastonished and irritated the count coming as it did in the form of asimple note with an order from kutuzov and received at night breakingin on his beauty sleepwhen later on in his memoirs count rostopchin explained his actions atthis time he repeatedly says that he was then actuated by two importantconsiderations to maintain tranquillity in moscow and expedite thedeparture of the inhabitants if one accepts this twofold aim allrostopchins actions appear irreproachable why were the holy relicsthe arms ammunition gunpowder and stores of corn not removed whywere thousands of inhabitants deceived into believing that moscow wouldnot be given upand thereby ruined to preserve the tranquillity ofthe city explains count rostopchin why were bundles of uselesspapers from the government offices and leppichs balloon and otherarticles removed to leave the town empty explains count rostopchinone need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any actionfinds a justificationall the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude forpublic tranquillityon what then was count rostopchins fear for the tranquillity ofmoscow based in  what reason was there for assuming any probabilityof an uprising in the city the inhabitants were leaving it and theretreating troops were filling it why should that cause the masses toriotneither in moscow nor anywhere in russia did anything resembling aninsurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town more than tenthousand people were still in moscow on the first and second ofseptember and except for a mob in the governors courtyard assembledthere at his bidding nothing happened it is obvious that there wouldhave been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people ifafter the battle of borodino when the surrender of moscow becamecertain or at least probable rostopchin instead of exciting the peopleby distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all theholy relics the gunpowder munitions and money and had told thepopulation plainly that the town would be abandonedrostopchin though he had patriotic sentiments was a sanguine andimpulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circlesand had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to beguiding ever since the enemys entry into smolensk he had inimagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling ofthe heart of russia not only did it seem to him as to alladministrators that he controlled the external actions of moscowsinhabitants but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude bymeans of his broadsheets and posters written in a coarse tone which thepeople despise in their own class and do not understand from those inauthority rostopchin was so pleased with the fine role of leader ofpopular feeling and had grown so used to it that the necessity ofrelinquishing that role and abandoning moscow without any heroic displaytook him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from underhis feet so that he positively did not know what to do though he knewit was coming he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly believethat moscow would be abandoned and did not prepare for it theinhabitants left against his wishes if the government offices wereremoved this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the countyielded reluctantly he was absorbed in the role he had created forhimself as is often the case with those gifted with an ardentimagination though he had long known that moscow would be abandoned heknew it only with his intellect he did not believe it in his heart anddid not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairsall his painstaking and energetic activity in how far it was useful andhad any effect on the people is another question had been simplydirected toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotichatred of the frenchbut when events assumed their true historical character when expressinghatred for the french in words proved insufficient when it was not evenpossible to express that hatred by fighting a battle when selfconfidence was of no avail in relation to the one question beforemoscow when the whole population streamed out of moscow as one manabandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action all thedepth of their national feeling then the role chosen by rostopchinsuddenly appeared senseless he unexpectedly felt himself ridiculousweak and alone with no ground to stand onwhen awakened from his sleep he received that cold peremptory notefrom kutuzov he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself toblame all that he had been specially put in charge of the stateproperty which he should have removed was still in moscow and it was nolonger possible to take the whole of it awaywho is to blame for it who has let things come to such a pass heruminated not i of course i had everything ready i had moscowfirmly in hand and this is what they have let it come to villainstraitors he thought without clearly defining who the villains andtraitors were but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoeverthey might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous position inwhich he found himselfall that night count rostopchin issued orders for which people came tohim from all parts of moscow those about him had never seen the countso morose and irritableyour excellency the director of the registrars

and angry replies indicating thatorders from him were not now needed that the whole affair carefullyprepared by him had now been ruined by somebody and that that somebodywould have to bear the whole responsibility for all that might happenoh tell that blockhead he said in reply to the question from theregistrars department that he should remain to guard his documentsnow why are you asking silly

political prisoners meshkovvereshchaginvereshchagin hasnt he been hanged yet shouted rostopchin bringhim to metoward nine oclock in the morning when the troops were already movingthrough moscow nobody came to the count any more for instructionsthose who were able to get away were going of their own accord thosewho remained behind decided for themselves what they must dothe count ordered his carriage that he might drive to sokolniki and satin his study with folded hands morose sallow and taciturnin quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it isonly by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is keptgoing and in this consciousness of being indispensable everyadministrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts while thesea of history remains calm the ruleradministrator in his frail barkholding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people and himselfmoving naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holdingon to but as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins to heave and theship to move such a delusion is no longer possible the ship movesindependently with its own enormous motion the boat hook no longerreaches the moving vessel and suddenly the administrator instead ofappearing a ruler and a source of power becomes an insignificantuseless feeble manrostopchin felt this and it was this which exasperated himthe superintendent of police whom the crowd had stopped went in to seehim at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that thehorses were harnessed they were both pale and the superintendent ofpolice after reporting that he had executed the instructions he hadreceived informed the count that an immense crowd had collected in thecourtyard and wished to see himwithout saying a word rostopchin rose and walked hastily to his lightluxurious drawing room went to the balcony door took hold of thehandle let it go again and went to the window from which he had abetter view of the whole crowd the tall lad was standing in frontflourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look the bloodstained smith stood beside him with a gloomy face a drone of voices wasaudible through the closed windowis my carriage ready asked rostopchin stepping back from the windowit is your excellency replied the adjutantrostopchin went again to the balcony doorbut what do they want he asked the superintendent of policeyour excellency they say they have got ready according to yourorders to go against the french and they shouted something abouttreachery but it is a turbulent crowd your excellencyi hardlymanaged to get away from it your excellency i venture to suggestyou may go i dont need you to tell me what to do exclaimedrostopchin angrilyhe stood by the balcony door looking at the crowdthis is what they have done with russia this is what they have donewith me thought he full of an irrepressible fury that welled upwithin him against the someone to whom what was happening might beattributed as often happens with passionate people he was mastered byanger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it here is thatmob the dregs of the people he thought as he gazed at the crowdthis rabble they have roused by their folly they want a victim hethought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his arm and thisthought occurred to him just because he himself desired a victimsomething on which to vent his rageis the carriage ready he asked againyes your excellency what are your orders about vereshchagin he iswaiting at the porch said the adjutantah exclaimed rostopchin as if struck by an unexpected recollectionand rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out onto the balconythe talking instantly ceased hats and caps were doffed and all eyeswere raised to the countgood morning lads said the count briskly and loudly thank you forcoming ill come out to you in a moment but we must first settle withthe villain we must punish the villain who has caused the ruin ofmoscow wait for meand the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed the doorbehind hima murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd hellsettle with all the villains youll see and you said the frenchhell show you what law is the mob were saying as if reproving oneanother for their lack of confidencea few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front doorgave an order and the dragoons formed up in line the crowd movedeagerly from the balcony toward the porch rostopchin coming out therewith quick angry steps looked hastily around as if seeking someonewhere is he he inquired and as he spoke he saw a young man cominground the corner of the house between two dragoons he had a long thinneck and his head that had been half shaved was again covered byshort hair this young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coatlined with fox fur that had once been smart and dirty hempen convicttrousers over which were pulled his thin dirty troddendown boots onhis thin weak legs were heavy chains which hampered his irresolutemovementsah said rostopchin hurriedly turning away his eyes from the youngman in the furlined coat and pointing to the bottom step of the porchput him therethe young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the spotindicated holding away with one finger the coat collar which chafed hisneck turned his long neck twice this way and that sighed andsubmissively folded before him his thin hands unused to workfor several seconds while the young man was taking his place on the stepthe silence continued only among the back rows of the people who wereall pressing toward the one spot could sighs groans and the shufflingof feet be heardwhile waiting for the young man to take his place on the step rostopchinstood frowning and rubbing his face with his handlads said he with a metallic ring in his voice this manvereshchagin is the scoundrel by whose doing moscow is perishingthe young man in the furlined coat stooping a little stood in asubmissive attitude his fingers clasped before him his emaciated youngface disfigured by the halfshaven head hung down hopelessly at thecounts first words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as ifwishing to say something or at least to meet his eye but rostopchin didnot look at him a vein in the young mans long thin neck swelled like acord and went blue behind the ear and suddenly his face flushedall eyes were fixed on him he looked at the crowd and rendered morehopeful by the expression he read on the faces there he smiled sadlyand timidly and lowering his head shifted his feet on the stephe has betrayed his tsar and his country he has gone over tobonaparte he alone of all the russians has disgraced the russian namehe has caused moscow to perish said rostopchin in a sharp even voicebut suddenly he glanced down at vereshchagin who continued to stand inthe same submissive attitude as if inflamed by the sight he raised hisarm and addressed the people almost shoutingdeal with him as you think fit i hand him over to youthe crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to oneanother to keep one another back to breathe in that stiflingatmosphere to be unable to stir and to await something unknownuncomprehended and terrible was becoming unbearable those standing infront who had seen and heard what had taken place before them allstood with wideopen eyes and mouths straining with all their strengthand held back the crowd that was pushing behind thembeat him let the traitor perish and not disgrace the russian nameshouted rostopchin cut him down i command ithearing not so much the words as the angry tone of rostopchins voicethe crowd moaned and heaved forward but again pausedcount exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of vereshchagin in themidst of the momentary silence that ensued count one god is above usboth he lifted his head and again the thick vein in his thin neckfilled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in his facehe did not finish what he wished to saycut him down i command it shouted rostopchin suddenly growingpale like vereshchagindraw sabers cried the dragoon officer drawing his ownanother still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching thefront ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch the tallyouth with a stony look on his face and rigid and uplifted arm stoodbeside vereshchaginsaber him the dragoon officer almost whisperedand one of the soldiers his face all at once distorted with furystruck vereshchagin on the head with the blunt side of his saberah cried vereshchagin in meek surprise looking round with afrightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him asimilar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd o lordexclaimed a sorrowful voicebut after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from vereshchaginhe uttered a plaintive cry of pain and that cry was fatal the barrierof human feeling strained to the utmost that had held the crowd incheck suddenly broke the crime had begun and must now be completed theplaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry roarof the crowd like the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship thatlast irresistible wave burst from the rear and reached the front rankscarrying them off their feet and engulfing them all the dragoon wasabout to repeat his blow vereshchagin with a cry of horror coveringhis head with his hands rushed toward the crowd the tall youthagainst whom he stumbled seized his thin neck with his hands andyelling wildly fell with him under the feet of the pressing strugglingcrowdsome beat and tore at vereshchagin others at the tall youth and thescreams of those that were being trampled on and of those who tried torescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd it was a longtime before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding youth beatenalmost to death and for a long time despite the feverish haste withwhich the mob tried to end the work that had been begun those who werehitting throttling and tearing at vereshchagin were unable to killhim for the crowd pressed from all sides swaying as one mass with themin the center and rendering it impossible for them either to kill him orlet him gohit him with an ax eh crushed traitor he sold christstill alive tenacious serves him right torture serves a thiefright use the hatchet whatstill aliveonly when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a longdrawn measured death rattle did the crowd around his prostratebleeding corpse begin rapidly to change places each one came upglanced at what had been done and with horror reproach andastonishment pushed back againo lord the people are like wild beasts how could he be alive voicesin the crowd could be heard saying quite a young fellow too musthave been a merchants son what men and they say hes not the rightone how not the right one o lord and theres another has beenbeaten toothey say hes nearly done for oh the people arentthey afraid of sinning said the same mob now looking with paineddistress at the dead body with its long thin halfsevered neck and itslivid face stained with blood and dusta painstaking police officer considering the presence of a corpse inhis excellencys courtyard unseemly told the dragoons to take it awaytwo dragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it along theground the gory duststained halfshaven head with its long necktrailed twisting along the ground the crowd shrank back from itat the moment when vereshchagin fell and the crowd closed in with savageyells and swayed about him rostopchin suddenly turned pale and insteadof going to the back entrance where his carriage awaited him went withhurried steps and bent head not knowing where and why along thepassage leading to the rooms on the ground floor the counts face waswhite and he could not control the feverish twitching of his lower jawthis way your excellency where are you going this wayplease said a trembling frightened voice behind himcount rostopchin was unable to reply and turning obediently went inthe direction indicated at the back entrance stood his caleche thedistant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there he hastilytook his seat and told the coachman to drive him to his country house insokolnikiwhen they reached the myasnitski street and could no longer hear theshouts of the mob the count began to repent he remembered withdissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before hissubordinates the mob is terribledisgusting he said to himself infrench they are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appeasecount one god is above us bothvereshchagins words suddenlyrecurred to him and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back but thiswas only a momentary feeling and count rostopchin smiled disdainfully athimself i had other duties thought he the people had to beappeased many other victims have perished and are perishing for thepublic goodand he began thinking of his social duties to his familyand to the city entrusted to him and of himselfnot himself astheodore vasilyevich rostopchin he fancied that theodore vasilyevichrostopchin was sacrificing himself for the public good but himself asgovernor the representative of authority and of the tsar had i beensimply theodore vasilyevich my course of action would have been quitedifferent but it was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity ascommanderinchieflightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no longerhearing the terrible sounds of the crowd rostopchin grew physicallycalm and as always happens as soon as he became physically tranquilhis mind devised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too thethought which tranquillized rostopchin was not a new one since theworld began and men have killed one another no one has ever committedsuch a crime against his fellow man without comforting himself with thissame idea this idea is le bien public the hypothetical welfare ofother peopleto a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain but he whocommits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies androstopchin now knew itnot only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done but heeven found cause for selfsatisfaction in having so successfullycontrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish acriminal and at the same time pacify the mobvereshchagin was tried and condemned to death thought rostopchinthough the senate had only condemned vereshchagin to hard labor hewas a traitor and a spy i could not let him go unpunished and so i havekilled two birds with one stone to appease the mob i gave them a victimand at the same time punished a miscreanthaving reached his country house and begun to give orders about domesticarrangements the count grew quite tranquilhalf an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across thesokolniki field no longer thinking of what had occurred but consideringwhat was to come he was driving to the yauza bridge where he had heardthat kutuzov was count rostopchin was mentally preparing the angry andstinging reproaches he meant to address to kutuzov for his deception hewould make that foxy old courtier feel that the responsibility for allthe calamities that would follow the abandonment of the city and theruin of russia as rostopchin regarded it would fall upon his dotingold head planning beforehand what he would say to kutuzov rostopchinturned angrily in his caleche and gazed sternly from side to sidethe sokolniki field was deserted only at the end of it in front of thealmshouse and the lunatic asylum could be seen some people in white andothers like them walking singly across the field shouting andgesticulatingone of these was running to cross the path of count rostopchinscarriage and the count himself his coachman and his dragoons lookedwith vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics andespecially at the one running toward themswaying from side to side on his long thin legs in his flutteringdressing gown this lunatic was running impetuously his gaze fixed onrostopchin shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to himto stop the lunatics solemn gloomy face was thin and yellow with itsbeard growing in uneven tufts his black agate pupils with saffronyellow whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelidsstop pull up i tell you he cried in a piercing voice and againshouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gesturescoming abreast of the caleche he ran beside itthrice have they slain me thrice have i risen from the dead theystoned me crucified me i shall rise shall rise shall risethey have torn my body the kingdom of god will be overthrown thricewill i overthrow it and thrice reestablish it he cried raising hisvoice higher and highercount rostopchin suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd closedin on vereshchagin he turned away go fas faster he cried in atrembling voice to his coachman the caleche flew over the ground asfast as the horses could draw it but for a long time count rostopchinstill heard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in thedistance while his eyes saw nothing but the astonished frightenedbloodstained face of the traitor in the furlined coatrecent as that mental picture was rostopchin already felt that it hadcut deep into his heart and drawn blood even now he felt clearly thatthe gory trace of that recollection would not pass with time but thatthe terrible memory would on the contrary dwell in his heart ever morecruelly and painfully to the end of his life he seemed still to hearthe sound of his own words cut him down i command itwhy did i utter those words it was by some accident i said them ineed not have said them he thought and then nothing would havehappened he saw the frightened and then infuriated face of the dragoonwho dealt the blow the look of silent timid reproach that boy in thefurlined coat had turned upon him but i did not do it for my ownsake i was bound to act that way the mob the traitor the publicwelfare thought hetroops were still crowding at the yauza bridge it was hot kutuzovdejected and frowning sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his whipin the sand when a caleche dashed up noisily a man in a generalsuniform with plumes in his hat went up to kutuzov and said something infrench it was count rostopchin he told kutuzov that he had comebecause moscow the capital was no more and only the army remainedthings would have been different if your serene highness had not toldme that you would not abandon moscow without another battle all thiswould not have happened he saidkutuzov looked at rostopchin as if not grasping what was said to himhe was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment on theface of the man addressing him rostopchin grew confused and becamesilent kutuzov slightly shook his head and not taking his penetratinggaze from rostopchins face muttered softlyno i shall not give up moscow without a battlewhether kutuzov was thinking of something entirely different when hespoke those words or uttered them purposely knowing them to bemeaningless at any rate rostopchin made no reply and hastily left himand strange to say the governor of moscow the proud count rostopchintook up a cossack whip and went to the bridge where he began with shoutsto drive on the carts that blocked the waytoward four oclock in the afternoon murats troops were enteringmoscow in front rode a detachment of wurttemberg hussars and behindthem rode the king of naples himself accompanied by a numerous suiteabout the middle of the arbat street near the church of the miraculousicon of st nicholas murat halted to await news from the advanceddetachment as to the condition in which they had found the citadel lekremlinaround murat gathered a group of those who had remained in moscow theyall stared in timid bewilderment at the strange longhaired commanderdressed up in feathers and goldis that their tsar himself hes not bad low voices could be heardsayingan interpreter rode up to the grouptake off your cap your caps these words went from one to anotherin the crowd the interpreter addressed an old porter and asked if itwas far to the kremlin the porter listening in perplexity to theunfamiliar polish accent and not realizing that the interpreter wasspeaking russian did not understand what was being said to him andslipped behind the othersmurat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the russianarmy was one of the russians understood what was asked and severalvoices at once began answering the interpreter a french officerreturning from the advanced detachment rode up to murat and reportedthat the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and that there wasprobably an ambuscade theregood said murat and turning to one of the gentlemen in his suiteordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gatesthe guns emerged at a trot from the column following murat and advancedup the arbat when they reached the end of the vozdvizhenka street theyhalted and drew in the square several french officers superintended theplacing of the guns and looked at the kremlin through field glassesthe bells in the kremlin were ringing for vespers and this soundtroubled the french they imagined it to be a call to arms a fewinfantrymen ran to the kutafyev gate beams and wooden screens had beenput there and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as soon asan officer and men began to run toward it a general who was standing bythe guns shouted some words of command to the officer and the latterran back again with his menthe sound of three more shots came from the gateone shot struck a french soldiers foot and from behind the screenscame the strange sound of a few voices shouting instantly as at a wordof command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of thefrench general officers and men changed to one of determinedconcentrated readiness for strife and suffering to all of them from themarshal to the least soldier that place was not the vozdvizhenkamokhavaya or kutafyev street nor the troitsa gate places familiar inmoscow but a new battlefield which would probably prove sanguinaryand all made ready for that battle the cries from the gates ceased theguns were advanced the artillerymen blew the ash off their linstocksand an officer gave the word fire this was followed by two whistlingsounds of canister shot one after another the shot rattled against thestone of the gate and upon the wooden beams and screens and twowavering clouds of smoke rose over the squarea few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the stonebuilt kremlin had died away the french heard a strange sound above theirhead thousands of crows rose above the walls and circled in the aircawing and noisily flapping their wings together with that sound came asolitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared thefigure of a bareheaded man in a peasants coat he grasped a musket andtook aim at the french fire repeated the officer once more and thereports of a musket and of two cannon shots were heard simultaneouslythe gate was again hidden by smokenothing more stirred behind the screens and the french infantry soldiersand officers advanced to the gate in the gateway lay three wounded andfour dead two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot of the walltoward the znamenkaclear that away said the officer pointing to the beams and thecorpses and the french soldiers after dispatching the wounded threwthe corpses over the parapetwho these men were nobody knew clear that away was all that was saidof them and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on thatthey might not stink thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines totheir memory these wretches had occupied the sacred citadel havingsupplied themselves with guns from the arsenal and fired thewretches at the french some of them were sabered and the kremlin waspurged of their presencemurat was informed that the way had been cleared the french entered thegates and began pitching their camp in the senate square out of thewindows of the senate house the soldiers threw chairs into the squarefor fuel and kindled fires thereother detachments passed through the kremlin and encamped along themoroseyka the lubyanka and pokrovka streets others quarteredthemselves along the vozdvizhenka the nikolski and the tverskoystreets no masters of the houses being found anywhere the french werenot billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in it asin a campthough tattered hungry worn out and reduced to a third of theiroriginal number the french entered moscow in good marching order itwas a weary and famished but still a fighting and menacing army but itremained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into theirdifferent lodgings as soon as the men of the various regiments began todisperse among the wealthy and deserted houses the army was lostforever and there came into being something nondescript neithercitizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders when five weekslater these same men left moscow they no longer formed an army theywere a mob of marauders each carrying a quantity of articles whichseemed to him valuable or useful the aim of each man when he leftmoscow was no longer as it had been to conquer but merely to keepwhat he had acquired like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrowneck of a jug and having seized a handful of nuts will not open itsfist for fear of losing what it holds and therefore perishes thefrench when they left moscow had inevitably to perish because theycarried their loot with them yet to abandon what they had stolen was asimpossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw and let goof its nuts ten minutes after each regiment had entered a moscowdistrict not a soldier or officer was left men in military uniformsand hessian boots could be seen through the windows laughing andwalking through the rooms in cellars and storerooms similar men werebusy among the provisions and in the yards unlocking or breaking opencoach house and stable doors lighting fires in kitchens and kneadingand baking bread with rolledup sleeves and cooking or frighteningamusing or caressing women and children there were many such men bothin the shops and housesbut there was no armyorder after order was issued by the french commanders that dayforbidding the men to disperse about the town sternly forbidding anyviolence to the inhabitants or any looting and announcing a roll callfor that very evening but despite all these measures the men who hadtill then constituted an army flowed all over the wealthy desertedcity with its comforts and plentiful supplies as a hungry herd ofcattle keeps well together when crossing a barren field but gets out ofhand and at once disperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches richpastures so did the army disperse all over the wealthy cityno residents were left in moscow and the soldierslike waterpercolating through sandspread irresistibly through the city in alldirections from the kremlin into which they had first marched thecavalry on entering a merchants house that had been abandoned andfinding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses went onall the same to the next house which seemed to them better many ofthem appropriated several houses chalked their names on them andquarreled and even fought with other companies for them before they hadhad time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to seethe city and hearing that everything had been abandoned rushed toplaces where valuables were to be had for the taking the officersfollowed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doingthe same in carriage row carriages had been left in the shops andgenerals flocked there to select caleches and coaches for themselvesthe few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers totheir houses hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plunderedthere were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it all aroundthe quarters occupied by the french were other regions still unexploredand unoccupied where they thought yet greater riches might be foundand moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper when water isspilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear andmud results and in the same way the entry of the famished army into therich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destructionof both the army and the wealthy citythe french attributed the fire of moscow au patriotisme feroce derostopchine  the russians to the barbarity of the french in realityhowever it was not and could not be possible to explain the burningof moscow by making any individual or any group of people responsiblefor it moscow was burned because it found itself in a position in whichany town built of wood was bound to burn quite apart from whether ithad or had not a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines desertedmoscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn onwhich sparks continually fall for several days a town built of woodwhere scarcely a day passes without conflagrations when the house ownersare in residence and a police force is present cannot help burning whenits inhabitants have left it and it is occupied by soldiers who smokepipes make campfires of the senate chairs in the senate square andcook themselves meals twice a day in peacetime it is only necessary tobillet troops in the villages of any district and the number of fires inthat district immediately increases how much then must the probabilityof fire be increased in an abandoned wooden town where foreign troopsare quartered le patriotisme feroce de rostopchine and the barbarityof the french were not to blame in the matter moscow was set on fire bythe soldiers pipes kitchens and campfires and by the carelessness ofenemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own even if there was anyarson which is very doubtful for no one had any reason to burn thehousesin any case a troublesome and dangerous thing to do arsoncannot be regarded as the cause for the same thing would have happenedwithout any incendiarism to rostopchins ferocious patriotismhowever tempting it might be for the french to blame rostopchinsferocity and for russians to blame the scoundrel bonaparte or later onto place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people it isimpossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of thefire for moscow had to burn as every village factory or house mustburn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are allowed tolive and cook their porridge moscow was burned by its inhabitants itis true but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remainedin it moscow when occupied by the enemy did not remain intact likeberlin vienna and other towns simply because its inhabitantsabandoned it and did not welcome the french with bread and salt norbring them the keys of the citythe absorption of the french by moscow radiating starwise as it didonly reached the quarter where pierre was staying by the evening of thesecond of septemberafter the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstancespierre was in a state bordering on insanity he was completely obsessedby one persistent thought he did not know how or when this thought hadtaken such possession of him but he remembered nothing of the pastunderstood nothing of the present and all he saw and heard appeared tohim like a dreamhe had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of lifes demandsthat enmeshed him and which in his present condition he was unable tounravel he had gone to joseph alexeevichs house on the plea ofsorting the deceaseds books and papers only in search of rest fromlifes turmoil for in his mind the memory of joseph alexeevich wasconnected with a world of eternal solemn and calm thoughts quitecontrary to the restless confusion into which he felt himself beingdrawn he sought a quiet refuge and in joseph alexeevichs study hereally found it when he sat with his elbows on the dusty writing tablein the deathlike stillness of the study calm and significant memoriesof the last few days rose one after another in his imaginationparticularly of the battle of borodino and of that vague sense of hisown insignificance and insincerity compared with the truth simplicityand strength of the class of men he mentally classed as they whengerasim roused him from his reverie the idea occurred to him of takingpart in the popular defense of moscow which he knew was projected andwith that object he had asked gerasim to get him a peasants coat and apistol confiding to him his intentions of remaining in josephalexeevichs house and keeping his name secret then during the firstday spent in inaction and solitude he tried several times to fix hisattention on the masonic manuscripts but was unable to do so the ideathat had previously occurred to him of the cabalistic significance ofhis name in connection with bonapartes more than once vaguely presenteditself but the idea that he lrusse besuhof was destined to set alimit to the power of the beast was as yet only one of the fancies thatoften passed through his mind and left no trace behindwhen having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part amongthe people in the defense of moscow pierre had met the rostovs andnatasha had said to him are you remaining in moscow how splendidthe thought flashed into his mind that it really would be a good thingeven if moscow were taken for him to remain there and do what he waspredestined to donext day with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging inany way behind them pierre went to the three hills gate but when hereturned to the house convinced that moscow would not be defended hesuddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibilityhad now become absolutely necessary and inevitable he must remain inmoscow concealing his name and must meet napoleon and kill him andeither perish or put an end to the misery of all europewhich it seemedto him was solely due to napoleonpierre knew all the details of the attempt on bonapartes life in by a german student in vienna and knew that the student had been shotand the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out hisdesign excited him still moretwo equally strong feelings drew pierre irresistibly to this purposethe first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering inview of the common calamity the same feeling that had caused him to goto mozhaysk on the twentyfifth and to make his way to the very thick ofthe battle and had now caused him to run away from his home and inplace of the luxury and comfort to which he was accustomed to sleep ona hard sofa without undressing and eat the same food as gerasim theother was that vague and quite russian feeling of contempt foreverything conventional artificial and humanfor everything themajority of men regard as the greatest good in the world pierre hadfirst experienced this strange and fascinating feeling at the slobodapalace when he had suddenly felt that wealth power and lifeall thatmen so painstakingly acquire and guardif it has any worth has so onlyby reason of the joy with which it can all be renouncedit was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his lastpenny on drink and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for noapparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money hepossesses the feeling which causes a man to perform actions which froman ordinary point of view are insane to test as it were his personalpower and strength affirming the existence of a higher nonhumancriterion of lifefrom the very day pierre had experienced this feeling for the first timeat the sloboda palace he had been continuously under its influence butonly now found full satisfaction for it moreover at this moment pierrewas supported in his design and prevented from renouncing it by what hehad already done in that direction if he were now to leave moscow likeeveryone else his flight from home the peasant coat the pistol andhis announcement to the rostovs that he would remain in moscow would allbecome not merely meaningless but contemptible and ridiculous and tothis pierre was very sensitivepierres physical condition as is always the case corresponded to hismental state the unaccustomed coarse food the vodka he drank duringthose days the absence of wine and cigars his dirty unchanged linentwo almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa without beddingallthis kept him in a state of excitement bordering on insanityit was two oclock in the afternoon the french had already enteredmoscow pierre knew this but instead of acting he only thought abouthis undertaking going over its minutest details in his mind in hisfancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of theblow or the death of napoleon but with extraordinary vividness andmelancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic enduranceyes alone for the sake of all i must do it or perish he thoughtyes i will approach and then suddenly with pistol or dagger butthat is all the same it is not i but the hand of providence thatpunishes thee i shall say thought he imagining what he would saywhen killing napoleon well then take me and execute me he went onspeaking to himself and bowing his head with a sad but firm expressionwhile pierre standing in the middle of the room was talking to himselfin this way the study door opened and on the threshold appeared thefigure of makar alexeevich always so timid before but now quitetransformedhis dressing gown was unfastened his face red and distorted he wasobviously drunk on seeing pierre he grew confused at first butnoticing embarrassment on pierres face immediately grew bold andstaggering on his thin legs advanced into the middle of the roomtheyre frightened he said confidentially in a hoarse voice i say iwont surrender i say am i not right sirhe paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized itwith unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridorgerasim and the porter who had followed makar alexeevich stopped himin the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him pierre comingout into the corridor looked with pity and repulsion at the halfcrazyold man makar alexeevich frowning with exertion held on to the pistoland screamed hoarsely evidently with some heroic fancy in his headto arms board them no you shant get it he yelledthat will do please that will do have the goodnessplease sir tolet go please sir pleaded gerasim trying carefully to steer makaralexeevich by the elbows back to the doorwho are you bonaparte shouted makar alexeevichthats not right sir come to your room please and rest allow me tohave the pistolbe off thou base slave touch me not see this shouted makaralexeevich brandishing the pistol board themcatch hold whispered gerasim to the porterthey seized makar alexeevich by the arms and dragged him to the doorthe vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle and ofa tipsy hoarse voicesuddenly a fresh sound a piercing feminine scream reverberated fromthe porch and the cook came running into the vestibuleits them gracious heavens o lord four of them horsemen shecriedgerasim and the porter let makar alexeevich go and in the now silentcorridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front door could beheardpierre having decided that until he had carried out his design he woulddisclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of french stood at thehalfopen door of the corridor intending to conceal himself as soon asthe french entered but the french entered and still pierre did notretirean irresistible curiosity kept him therethere were two of them one was an officera tall soldierly handsomemanthe other evidently a private or an orderly sunburned short andthin with sunken cheeks and a dull expression the officer walked infront leaning on a stick and slightly limping when he had advanced afew steps he stopped having apparently decided that these were goodquarters turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance and ina loud voice of command ordered them to put up the horses having donethat the officer lifting his elbow with a smart gesture stroked hismustache and lightly touched his hatbonjour la compagnie  said he gaily smiling and looking about him good day everybodyno one gave any replyvous etes le bourgeois  the officer asked gerasim are you the master heregerasim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring lookquartier quartier logement said the officer looking down at thelittle man with a condescending and goodnatured smile les francaissont de bons enfants que diable voyons ne nous fachons pas monvieux  added he clapping the scared and silent gerasim on theshoulder well does no one speak french in this establishment heasked again in french looking around and meeting pierres eyes pierremoved away from the door quarters quarters lodgings the french are good fellows what thedevil there dont let us be cross old fellowagain the officer turned to gerasim and asked him to show him the roomsin the housemaster not heredont understand me you said gerasim tryingto render his words more comprehensible by contorting themstill smiling the french officer spread out his hands before gerasimsnose intimating that he did not understand him either and movedlimping to the door at which pierre was standing pierre wished to goaway and conceal himself but at that moment he saw makar alexeevichappearing at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his hand with amadmans cunning makar alexeevich eyed the frenchman raised hispistol and took aimboard them yelled the tipsy man trying to press the trigger hearingthe yell the officer turned round and at the same moment pierre threwhimself on the drunkard just when pierre snatched at and struck up thepistol makar alexeevich at last got his fingers on the trigger therewas a deafening report and all were enveloped in a cloud of smoke thefrenchman turned pale and rushed to the doorforgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of french pierresnatching away the pistol and throwing it down ran up to the officerand addressed him in frenchyou are not wounded he askedi think not answered the frenchman feeling himself over but i havehad a lucky escape this time he added pointing to the damaged plasterof the wall who is that man said he looking sternly at pierreoh i am really in despair at what has occurred said pierre rapidlyquite forgetting the part he had intended to play he is an unfortunatemadman who did not know what he was doingthe officer went up to makar alexeevich and took him by the collarmakar alexeevich was standing with parted lips swaying as if about tofall asleep as he leaned against the wallbrigand you shall pay for this said the frenchman letting go ofhim we french are merciful after victory but we do not pardontraitors he added with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine energeticgesturepierre continued in french to persuade the officer not to hold thatdrunken imbecile to account the frenchman listened in silence with thesame gloomy expression but suddenly turned to pierre with a smile fora few seconds he looked at him in silence his handsome face assumed amelodramatically gentle expression and he held out his handyou have saved my life you are french said hefor a frenchman that deduction was indubitable only a frenchman couldperform a great deed and to save his lifethe life of m ramballecaptain of the th light regimentwas undoubtedly a very great deedbut however indubitable that conclusion and the officers convictionbased upon it pierre felt it necessary to disillusion himi am russian he said quicklytut tut tut tell that to others said the officer waving hisfinger before his nose and smiling you shall tell me all about thatpresently i am delighted to meet a compatriot well and what are we todo with this man he added addressing himself to pierre as to abrothereven if pierre were not a frenchman having once received that loftiestof human appellations he could not renounce it said the officers lookand tone in reply to his last question pierre again explained who makaralexeevich was and how just before their arrival that drunken imbecilehad seized the loaded pistol which they had not had time to recover fromhim and begged the officer to let the deed go unpunishedthe frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture with hisarmyou have saved my life you are french you ask his pardon i grant ityou lead that man away said he quickly and energetically and takingthe arm of pierre whom he had promoted to be a frenchman for saving hislife he went with him into the roomthe soldiers in the yard hearing the shot came into the passage askingwhat had happened and expressed their readiness to punish the culpritsbut the officer sternly checked themyou will be called in when you are wanted he saidthe soldiers went out again and the orderly who had meanwhile had timeto visit the kitchen came up to his officercaptain there is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen said heshall i serve them upyes and some wine answered the captainwhen the french officer went into the room with pierre the latter againthought it his duty to assure him that he was not french and wished togo away but the officer would not hear of it he was so very politeamiable goodnatured and genuinely grateful to pierre for saving hislife that pierre had not the heart to refuse and sat down with him inthe parlorthe first room they entered to pierres assurances that hewas not a frenchman the captain evidently not understanding how anyonecould decline so flattering an appellation shrugged his shoulders andsaid that if pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a russian let itbe so but for all that he would be forever bound to pierre by gratitudefor saving his lifehad this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving thefeelings of others and had he at all understood what pierres feelingswere the latter would probably have left him but the mans animatedobtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed pierrea frenchman or a russian prince incognito said the officer lookingat pierres fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his finger iowe my life to you and offer you my friendship a frenchman neverforgets either an insult or a service i offer you my friendship thatis all i can saythere was so much good nature and nobility in the french sense of theword in the officers voice in the expression of his face and in hisgestures that pierre unconsciously smiling in response to thefrenchmans smile pressed the hand held out to himcaptain ramballe of the th light regiment chevalier of the legionof honor for the affair on the seventh of september he introducedhimself a selfsatisfied irrepressible smile puckering his lips underhis mustache will you now be so good as to tell me with whom i havethe honor of conversing so pleasantly instead of being in the ambulancewith that maniacs bullet in my bodypierre replied that he could not tell him his name and blushing beganto try to invent a name and to say something about his reason forconcealing it but the frenchman hastily interrupted himoh please said he i understand your reasons you are an officera superior officer perhaps you have borne arms against us thats notmy business i owe you my life that is enough for me i am quite atyour service you belong to the gentry he concluded with a shade ofinquiry in his tone pierre bent his head your baptismal name if youplease that is all i ask monsieur pierre you say thats all iwant to knowwhen the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and vodkabrought with some wine which the french had taken from a russian cellarand brought with them ramballe invited pierre to share his dinner andhimself began to eat greedily and quickly like a healthy and hungry manmunching his food rapidly with his strong teeth continually smackinghis lips and repeatingexcellent delicious his face grew red andwas covered with perspiration pierre was hungry and shared the dinnerwith pleasure morel the orderly brought some hot water in a saucepanand placed a bottle of claret in it he also brought a bottle of kvasstaken from the kitchen for them to try that beverage was already knownto the french and had been given a special name they called it limonadede cochon pigs lemonade and morel spoke well of the limonade decochon he had found in the kitchen but as the captain had the wine theyhad taken while passing through moscow he left the kvass to morel andapplied himself to the bottle of bordeaux he wrapped the bottle up toits neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and forpierre the satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the captainstill more lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinneryes my dear monsieur pierre i owe you a fine votive candle for savingme from that maniac you see i have bullets enough in my bodyalready here is one i got at wagram he touched his side and asecond at smolenskhe showed a scar on his cheekand this leg whichas you see does not want to march i got that on the seventh at thegreat battle of la moskowa sacre dieu it was splendid that deluge offire was worth seeing it was a tough job you set us

march as if on parade fine fellows our king ofnaples who knows whats what cried bravo ha ha so you are one ofus soldiers he added smiling after a momentary pause so much thebetter so much the better monsieur pierre terrible in battlegallant with the fair he winked and smiled thats what thefrench are monsieur pierre arent theythe captain was so naively and goodhumoredly gay so real and sopleased with himself that pierre almost winked back as he looked merrilyat him probably the word gallant turned the captains thoughts to thestate of moscowapropos tell me please is it true that the women have all leftmoscow what a queer idea what had they to be afraid ofwould not the french ladies leave paris if the russians entered itasked pierreha ha ha the frenchman emitted a merry sanguine chuckle pattingpierre on the shoulder what a thing to say he exclaimed parisbut paris parisparisthe capital of the world pierre finished his remark for himthe captain looked at pierre he had a habit of stopping short in themiddle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing kindly eyeswell if you hadnt told me you were russian i should have wageredthat you were parisian you have that i dont know what that andhaving uttered this compliment he again gazed at him in silencei have been in paris i spent years there said pierreoh yes one sees that plainly paris a man who doesnt know parisis a savage you can tell a parisian two leagues off paris is talma laduchenois potier the sorbonne the boulevards and noticing that hisconclusion was weaker than what had gone before he added quicklythere is only one paris in the world you have been to paris and haveremained russian well i dont esteem you the less for itunder the influence of the wine he had drunk and after the days he hadspent alone with his depressing thoughts pierre involuntarily enjoyedtalking with this cheerful and goodnatured manto return to your ladiesi hear they are lovely what a wretched ideato go and bury themselves in the steppes when the french army is inmoscow what a chance those girls have missed your peasants nowthats another thing but you civilized people you ought to know usbetter than that we took vienna berlin madrid naples rome warsawall the worlds capitals we are feared but we are loved we arenice to know and then the emperor he began but pierre interruptedhimthe emperor pierre repeated and his face suddenly became sad andembarrassed is the emperorthe emperor he is generosity mercy justice order geniusthatswhat the emperor is it is i ramballe who tell you so i assure youi was his enemy eight years ago my father was an emigrant count butthat man has vanquished me he has taken hold of me i could not resistthe sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered francewhen i understood what he wantedwhen i saw that he was preparing a bedof laurels for us you know i said to myself that is a monarch andi devoted myself to him so there oh yes mon cher he is the greatestman of the ages past or futureis he in moscow pierre stammered with a guilty lookthe frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiledno he will make his entry tomorrow he replied and continued histalktheir conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at thegate and by morel who came to say that some wurttemberg hussars hadcome and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the captainshorses were this difficulty had arisen chiefly because the hussars didnot understand what was said to them in frenchthe captain had their senior sergeant called in and in a stern voiceasked him to what regiment he belonged who was his commanding officerand by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that were alreadyoccupied the german who knew little french answered the two firstquestions by giving the names of his regiment and of his commandingofficer but in reply to the third question which he did not understandsaid introducing broken french into his own german that he was thequartermaster of the regiment and his commander had ordered him tooccupy all the houses one after another pierre who knew germantranslated what the german said to the captain and gave the captainsreply to the wurttemberg hussar in german when he had understood whatwas said to him the german submitted and took his men elsewhere thecaptain went out into the porch and gave some orders in a loud voicewhen he returned to the room pierre was sitting in the same place asbefore with his head in his hands his face expressed suffering hereally was suffering at that moment when the captain went out and hewas left alone suddenly he came to himself and realized the position hewas in it was not that moscow had been taken or that the happyconquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him painful as thatwas it was not that which tormented pierre at the moment he wastormented by the consciousness of his own weakness the few glasses ofwine he had drunk and the conversation with this goodnatured man haddestroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which he had spent the lastfew days and which was essential for the execution of his design thepistol dagger and peasant coat were ready napoleon was to enter thetown next day pierre still considered that it would be a useful andworthy action to slay the evildoer but now he felt that he would not doit he did not know why but he felt a foreboding that he would notcarry out his intention he struggled against the confession of hisweakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that hisformer gloomy frame of mind concerning vengeance killing and selfsacrifice had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first man hemetthe captain returned to the room limping slightly and whistling a tunethe frenchmans chatter which had previously amused pierre now repelledhim the tune he was whistling his gait and the gesture with which hetwirled his mustache all now seemed offensive i will go awayimmediately i wont say another word to him thought pierre hethought this but still sat in the same place a strange feeling ofweakness tied him to the spot he wished to get up and go away butcould not do sothe captain on the other hand seemed very cheerful he paced up anddown the room twice his eyes shone and his mustache twitched as if hewere smiling to himself at some amusing thoughtthe colonel of those wurttembergers is delightful he suddenly saidhes a german but a nice fellow all the same but hes a germanhe sat down facing pierre by the way you know german thenpierre looked at him in silencewhat is the german for sheltershelter pierre repeated the german for shelter is unterkunfthow do you say it the captain asked quickly and doubtfullyunterkunft pierre repeatedonterkoff said the captain and looked at pierre for some seconds withlaughing eyes these germans are firstrate fools dont you think somonsieur pierre he concludedwell lets have another bottle of this moscow bordeaux shall wemorel will warm us up another little bottle morel he called outgailymorel brought candles and a bottle of wine the captain looked at pierreby the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expressionon his companions face ramballe with genuine distress and sympathy inhis face went up to pierre and bent over himthere now were sad said he touching pierres hand have i upsetyou no really have you anything against me he asked pierreperhaps its the state of affairspierre did not answer but looked cordially into the frenchmans eyeswhose expression of sympathy was pleasing to himhonestly without speaking of what i owe you i feel friendship foryou can i do anything for you dispose of me it is for life and deathi say it with my hand on my heart said he striking his chestthank you said pierrethe captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned thatshelter was unterkunft in german and his face suddenly brightenedwell in that case i drink to our friendship he cried gaily fillingtwo glasses with winepierre took one of the glasses and emptied it ramballe emptied his tooagain pressed pierres hand and leaned his elbows on the table in apensive attitudeyes my dear friend he began such is fortunes caprice who wouldhave said that i should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons in theservice of bonaparte as we used to call him yet here i am in moscowwith him i must tell you mon cher he continued in the sad andmeasured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story that our nameis one of the most ancient in franceand with a frenchmans easy and naive frankness the captain told pierrethe story of his ancestors his childhood youth and manhood and allabout his relations and his financial and family affairs ma pauvremere playing of course an important part in the storybut all that is only lifes setting the real thing is lovelove am inot right monsieur pierre said he growing animated another glasspierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a thirdoh women women and the captain looking with glistening eyes atpierre began talking of love and of his love affairsthere were very many of these as one could easily believe looking atthe officers handsome selfsatisfied face and noting the eagerenthusiasm with which he spoke of women though all ramballes lovestories had the sensual character which frenchmen regard as the specialcharm and poetry of love yet he told his story with such sincereconviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of loveand he described women so alluringly that pierre listened to him withcuriosityit was plain that lamour which the frenchman was so fond of was notthat low and simple kind that pierre had once felt for his wife nor wasit the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced fornatasha ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally the one heconsidered the love of clodhoppers and the other the love ofsimpletons lamour which the frenchman worshiped consistedprincipally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in acombination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feelingthus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for afascinating marquise of thirtyfive and at the same time for a charminginnocent child of seventeen daughter of the bewitching marquise theconflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter ending inthe mothers sacrificing herself and offering her daughter in marriageto her lover even now agitated the captain though it was the memory ofa distant past then he recounted an episode in which the husband playedthe part of the lover and hethe loverassumed the role of thehusband as well as several droll incidents from his recollections ofgermany where shelter is called unterkunft and where the husbands eatsauerkraut and the young girls are too blondefinally the latest episode in poland still fresh in the captainsmemory and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face wasof how he had saved the life of a pole in general the saving of lifecontinually occurred in the captains stories and the pole hadentrusted to him his enchanting wife parisienne de coeur while himselfentering the french service the captain was happy the enchantingpolish lady wished to elope with him but prompted by magnanimity thecaptain restored the wife to the husband saying as he did so i havesaved your life and i save your honor having repeated these words thecaptain wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake as if driving away theweakness which assailed him at this touching recollectionlistening to the captains tales pierreas often happens late in theevening and under the influence of winefollowed all that was told himunderstood it all and at the same time followed a train of personalmemories which he knew not why suddenly arose in his mind whilelistening to these love stories his own love for natasha unexpectedlyrose to his mind and going over the pictures of that love in hisimagination he mentally compared them with ramballes tales listeningto the story of the struggle between love and duty pierre saw beforehis eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting with the object ofhis love at the sukharev water tower at the time of that meeting it hadnot produced an effect upon himhe had not even once recalled it butnow it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something veryimportant and poeticpeter kirilovich come here we have recognized you he now seemed tohear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes hersmile her traveling hood and a stray lock of her hair and thereseemed to him something pathetic and touching in all thishaving finished his tale about the enchanting polish lady the captainasked pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrificehimself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husbandchallenged by this question pierre raised his head and felt a need toexpress the thoughts that filled his mind he began to explain that heunderstood love for a women somewhat differently he said that in allhis life he had loved and still loved only one woman and that she couldnever be histiens said the captainpierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliestyears but that he had not dared to think of her because she was tooyoung and because he had been an illegitimate son without a nameafterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think ofher because he loved her too well placing her far above everything inthe world and especially therefore above himselfwhen he had reached this point pierre asked the captain whether heunderstood thatthe captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not understandit he begged pierre to continueplatonic love clouds he mutteredwhether it was the wine he had drunk or an impulse of frankness or thethought that this man did not and never would know any of those whoplayed a part in his story or whether it was all these things togethersomething loosened pierres tongue speaking thickly and with a farawaylook in his shining eyes he told the whole story of his life hismarriage natashas love for his best friend her betrayal of him andall his own simple relations with her urged on by ramballes questionshe also told what he had at first concealedhis own position and evenhis namemore than anything else in pierres story the captain was impressed bythe fact that pierre was very rich had two mansions in moscow and thathe had abandoned everything and not left the city but remained thereconcealing his name and stationwhen it was late at night they went out together into the street thenight was warm and light to the left of the house on the pokrovka afire glowedthe first of those that were beginning in moscow to theright and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon andopposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in pierresheart with his love at the gate stood gerasim the cook and twofrenchmen their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible remarks intwo languages could be heard they were looking at the glow seen in thetownthere was nothing terrible in the one small distant fire in the immensecitygazing at the high starry sky at the moon at the comet and at theglow from the fire pierre experienced a joyful emotion there now howgood it is what more does one need thought he and suddenlyremembering his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he leanedagainst the fence to save himself from fallingwithout taking leave of his new friend pierre left the gate withunsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa andimmediately fell asleepthe glow of the first fire that began on the second of september waswatched from the various roads by the fugitive muscovites and by theretreating troops with many different feelingsthe rostov party spent the night at mytishchi fourteen miles frommoscow they had started so late on the first of september the road hadbeen so blocked by vehicles and troops so many things had beenforgotten for which servants were sent back that they had decided tospend that night at a place three miles out of moscow the next morningthey woke late and were again delayed so often that they only got as faras great mytishchi at ten oclock that evening the rostov family andthe wounded traveling with them were all distributed in the yards andhuts of that large village the rostovs servants and coachmen and theorderlies of the wounded officers after attending to their masters hadsupper fed the horses and came out into the porchesin a neighboring hut lay raevskis adjutant with a fractured wrist theawful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously and hismoaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the autumn night he hadspent the first night in the same yard as the rostovs the countess saidshe had been unable to close her eyes on account of his moaning and atmytishchi she moved into a worse hut simply to be farther away from thewounded manin the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed above the highbody of a coach standing before the porch the small glow of anotherfire one glow had long been visible and everybody knew that it waslittle mytishchi burningset on fire by mamonovs cossacksbut look here brothers theres another fire remarked an orderlyall turned their attention to the glowbut they told us

went out to look sonyaand madame schoss who had not yet undressed went out with him onlynatasha and the countess remained in the room petya was no longer withthe family he had gone on with his regiment which was making fortroitsathe countess on hearing that moscow was on fire began to cry natashapale with a fixed look was sitting on the bench under the icons justwhere she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to her fatherswords she was listening to the ceaseless moaning of the adjutant threehouses offoh how terrible said sonya returning from the yard chilled andfrightened i believe the whole of moscow will burn theres an awfulglow natasha do look you can see it from the window she said to hercousin evidently wishing to distract her mindbut natasha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to herand again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove she had been inthis condition of stupor since the morning when sonya to the surpriseand annoyance of the countess had for some unaccountable reason foundit necessary to tell natasha of prince andrews wound and of his beingwith their party the countess had seldom been so angry with anyone asshe was with sonya sonya had cried and begged to be forgiven and nowas if trying to atone for her fault paid unceasing attention to hercousinlook natasha how dreadfully it is burning said shewhats burning asked natasha oh yes moscowand as if in order not to offend sonya and to get rid of her she turnedher face to the window looked out in such a way that it was evidentthat she could not see anything and again settled down in her formerattitudebut you didnt see ityes really i did natasha replied in a voice that pleaded to be leftin peaceboth the countess and sonya understood that naturally neither moscownor the burning of moscow nor anything else could seem of importance tonatashathe count returned and lay down behind the partition the countess wentup to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as shewas wont to do when natasha was ill then touched her forehead with herlips as if to feel whether she was feverish and finally kissed heryou are cold you are trembling all over youd better lie down saidthe countesslie down all right i will ill lie down at once said natashawhen natasha had been told that morning that prince andrew was seriouslywounded and was traveling with their party she had at first asked manyquestions where was he going how was he wounded was it serious andcould she see him but after she had been told that she could not seehim that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in dangershe ceased to ask questions or to speak at all evidently disbelievingwhat they told her and convinced that say what she might she wouldstill be told the same all the way she had sat motionless in a cornerof the coach with wide open eyes and the expression in them which thecountess knew so well and feared so much and now she sat in the sameway on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving she wasplanning something and either deciding or had already decided somethingin her mind the countess knew this but what it might be she did notknow and this alarmed and tormented hernatasha undress darling lie down on my beda bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only madame schossand the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floorno mamma i will lie down here on the floor natasha repliedirritably and she went to the window and opened it through the openwindow the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly she puther head out into the damp night air and the countess saw her slim neckshaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame natasha knewit was not prince andrew who was moaning she knew prince andrew was inthe same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passagebut this dreadful incessant moaning made her sob the countess exchangeda look with sonyalie down darling lie down my pet said the countess softlytouching natashas shoulders come lie downoh yes ill lie down at once said natasha and began hurriedlyundressing tugging at the tapes of her petticoatwhen she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket she satdown with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on thefloor jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front andbegan replaiting it her long thin practiced fingers rapidlyunplaited replaited and tied up her plait her head moved from side toside from habit but her eyes feverishly wide looked fixedly beforeher when her toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto thesheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the doornatasha youd better lie in the middle said sonyaill stay here muttered natasha do lie down she added crosslyand buried her face in the pillowthe countess madame schoss and sonya undressed hastily and lay downthe small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in theroom but in the yard there was a light from the fire at littlemytishchi a mile and a half away and through the night came the noiseof people shouting at a tavern mamonovs cossacks had set up across thestreet and the adjutants unceasing moans could still be heardfor a long time natasha listened attentively to the sounds that reachedher from inside and outside the room and did not move first she heardher mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under herthen madame schoss familiar whistling snore and sonyas gentlebreathing then the countess called to natasha natasha did not answeri think shes asleep mamma said sonya softlyafter a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no onerepliedsoon after that natasha heard her mothers even breathing natasha didnot move though her little bare foot thrust out from under the quiltwas growing cold on the bare flooras if to celebrate a victory over everybody a cricket chirped in acrack in the wall a cock crowed far off and another replied near bythe shouting in the tavern had died down only the moaning of theadjutant was heard natasha sat upsonya are you asleep mamma she whisperedno one replied natasha rose slowly and carefully crossed herself andstepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her slim supplebare feet the boards of the floor creaked stepping cautiously from onefoot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door andgrasped the cold door handleit seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically againstall the walls of the room it was her own heart sinking with alarm andterror and overflowing with loveshe opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the colddamp earthen floor of the passage the cold she felt refreshed her withher bare feet she touched a sleeping man stepped over him and openedthe door into the part of the hut where prince andrew lay it was darkin there in the farthest corner on a bench beside a bed on whichsomething was lying stood a tallow candle with a long thick andsmoldering wickfrom the moment she had been told that morning of prince andrews woundand his presence there natasha had resolved to see him she did notknow why she had to she knew the meeting would be painful but felt themore convinced that it was necessaryall day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night but nowthat the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she mightsee how was he maimed what was left of him was he like that incessantmoaning of the adjutants yes he was altogether like that in herimagination he was that terrible moaning personified when she saw anindistinct shape in the corner and mistook his knees raised under thequilt for his shoulders she imagined a horrible body there and stoodstill in terror but an irresistible impulse drew her forward shecautiously took one step and then another and found herself in themiddle of a small room containing baggage another mantimokhinwaslying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons and two othersthedoctor and a valetlay on the floorthe valet sat up and whispered something timokhin kept awake by thepain in his wounded leg gazed with wideopen eyes at this strangeapparition of a girl in a white chemise dressing jacket and nightcapthe valets sleepy frightened exclamation what do you want whatsthe matter made natasha approach more swiftly to what was lying in thecorner horribly unlike a man as that body looked she must see him shepassed the valet the snuff fell from the candle wick and she sawprince andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt and such as shehad always seen himhe was the same as ever but the feverish color of his face hisglittering eyes rapturously turned toward her and especially his neckdelicate as a childs revealed by the turndown collar of his shirtgave him a peculiarly innocent childlike look such as she had neverseen on him before she went up to him and with a swift flexibleyouthful movement dropped on her kneeshe smiled and held out his hand to herseven days had passed since prince andrew found himself in the ambulancestation on the field of borodino his feverish state and theinflammation of his bowels which were injured were in the doctorsopinion sure to carry him off but on the seventh day he ate withpleasure a piece of bread with some tea and the doctor noticed that histemperature was lower he had regained consciousness that morning thefirst night after they left moscow had been fairly warm and he hadremained in the caleche but at mytishchi the wounded man himself askedto be taken out and given some tea the pain caused by his removal intothe hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness when hehad been placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless withclosed eyes then he opened them and whispered softly and the teahis remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished thedoctor he felt prince andrews pulse and to his surprise anddissatisfaction found it had improved he was dissatisfied because heknew by experience that if his patient did not die now he would do so alittle later with greater suffering timokhin the rednosed major ofprince andrews regiment had joined him in moscow and was being takenalong with him having been wounded in the leg at the battle ofborodino they were accompanied by a doctor prince andrews valet hiscoachman and two orderliesthey gave prince andrew some tea he drank it eagerly looking withfeverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand andremember somethingi dont want any more is timokhin here he askedtimokhin crept along the bench to himi am here your excellencyhows your woundmine sir all right but how about youprince andrew again pondered as if trying to remember somethingcouldnt one get a book he askedwhat bookthe gospels i havent onethe doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he wasfeeling prince andrew answered all his questions reluctantly butreasonably and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he wasuncomfortable and in great pain the doctor and valet lifted the cloakwith which he was covered and making wry faces at the noisome smell ofmortifying flesh that came from the wound began examining that dreadfulplace the doctor was very much displeased about something and made achange in the dressings turning the wounded man over so that he groanedagain and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony he kept askingthem to get him the book and put it under himwhat trouble would it be to you he said i have not got one pleaseget it for me and put it under for a moment he pleaded in a piteousvoicethe doctor went into the passage to wash his handsyou fellows have no conscience said he to the valet who was pouringwater over his hands for just one moment i didnt look after youits such pain you know that i wonder how he can bear itby the lord jesus christ i thought we had put something under himsaid the valetthe first time prince andrew understood where he was and what was thematter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he askedto be carried into the hut after his caleche had stopped at mytishchiafter growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut heagain regained consciousness and while drinking tea once more recalledall that had happened to him and above all vividly remembered themoment at the ambulance station when at the sight of the sufferings ofa man he disliked those new thoughts had come to him which promised himhappiness and those thoughts though now vague and indefinite againpossessed his soul he remembered that he had now a new source ofhappiness and that this happiness had something to do with the gospelsthat was why he asked for a copy of them the uncomfortable position inwhich they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughtsand when he came to himself a third time it was in the completestillness of the night everybody near him was sleeping a cricketchirped from across the passage someone was shouting and singing in thestreet cockroaches rustled on the table on the icons and on thewalls and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around thecandle beside him the wick of which was charred and had shaped itselflike a mushroomhis mind was not in a normal state a healthy man usually thinks offeels and remembers innumerable things simultaneously but has thepower and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which tofix his whole attention a healthy man can tear himself away from thedeepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and canthen return again to his own thoughts but prince andrews mind was notin a normal state in that respect all the powers of his mind were moreactive and clearer than ever but they acted apart from his will mostdiverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously at times hisbrain suddenly began to work with a vigor clearness and depth it hadnever reached when he was in health but suddenly in the midst of itswork it would turn to some unexpected idea and he had not the strengthto turn it back againyes a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot bedeprived he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hutgazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes a happinesslying beyond material forces outside the material influences that acton mana happiness of the soul alone the happiness of loving everyman can understand it but to conceive it and enjoin it was possibleonly for god but how did god enjoin that law and why was the sonand suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off and prince andrewheard without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality a softwhispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating pitipitipiti and then titi and then again pitipitipiti and titionce more at the same time he felt that above his face above the verymiddle of it some strange airy structure was being erected out ofslender needles or splinters to the sound of this whispered music hefelt that he had to balance carefully though it was difficult so thatthis airy structure should not collapse but nevertheless it keptcollapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of whispered rhythmicmusicit stretches stretches spreading out and stretching saidprince andrew to himself while listening to this whispering and feelingthe sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edificeof needles he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle andheard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly thatflopped against his pillow and his face each time the fly touched hisface it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did notdestroy the structure though it knocked against the very region of hisface where it was rising but besides this there was something else ofimportance it was something white by the doorthe statue of a sphinxwhich also oppressed himbut perhaps thats my shirt on the table he thought and thats mylegs and that is the door but why is it always stretching and drawingitself out and pitipitipiti and titi and pitipitipitithats enough please leave off prince andrew painfully entreatedsomeone and suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface ofhis mind with peculiar clearness and forceyeslove he thought again quite clearly but not love which lovesfor something for some quality for some purpose or for some reasonbut the love which iwhile dyingfirst experienced when i saw my enemyand yet loved him i experienced that feeling of love which is the veryessence of the soul and does not require an object now again i feelthat bliss to love ones neighbors to love ones enemies to loveeverything to love god in all his manifestations it is possible tolove someone dear to you with human love but an enemy can only be lovedby divine love that is why i experienced such joy when i felt that iloved that man what has become of him is he alivewhen loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred butdivine love cannot change no neither death nor anything else candestroy it it is the very essence of the soul yet how many people havei hated in my life and of them all i loved and hated none as i didher and he vividly pictured to himself natasha not as he had done inthe past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight but for thefirst time picturing to himself her soul and he understood herfeelings her sufferings shame and remorse he now understood for thefirst time all the cruelty of his rejection of her the cruelty of hisrupture with her if only it were possible for me to see her once morejust once looking into those eyes to saypitipitipiti and titi and pitipitipiti boom flopped the flyand his attention was suddenly carried into another world a world ofreality and delirium in which something particular was happening inthat world some structure was still being erected and did not fallsomething was still stretching out and the candle with its red halo wasstill burning and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door butbesides all this something creaked there was a whiff of fresh air anda new white sphinx appeared standing at the door and that sphinx hadthe pale face and shining eyes of the very natasha of whom he had justbeen thinkingoh how oppressive this continual delirium is thought prince andrewtrying to drive that face from his imagination but the face remainedbefore him with the force of reality and drew nearer prince andrewwished to return to that former world of pure thought but he could notand delirium drew him back into its domain the soft whispering voicecontinued its rhythmic murmur something oppressed him and stretchedout and the strange face was before him prince andrew collected allhis strength in an effort to recover his senses he moved a little andsuddenly there was a ringing in his ears a dimness in his eyes andlike a man plunged into water he lost consciousness when he came tohimself natasha that same living natasha whom of all people he mostlonged to love with this new pure divine love that had been revealed tohim was kneeling before him he realized that it was the real livingnatasha and he was not surprised but quietly happy natasha motionlesson her knees she was unable to stir with frightened eyes riveted onhim was restraining her sobs her face was pale and rigid only in thelower part of it something quiveredprince andrew sighed with relief smiled and held out his handyou he said how fortunatewith a rapid but careful movement natasha drew nearer to him on herknees and taking his hand carefully bent her face over it and begankissing it just touching it lightly with her lipsforgive me she whispered raising her head and glancing at himforgive mei love you said prince andrewforgiveforgive what he askedforgive me for what i have done faltered natasha in a scarcelyaudible broken whisper and began kissing his hand more rapidly justtouching it with her lipsi love you more better than before said prince andrew lifting herface with his hand so as to look into her eyesthose eyes filled with happy tears gazed at him timidlycompassionately and with joyous love natashas thin pale face withits swollen lips was more than plainit was dreadful but princeandrew did not see that he saw her shining eyes which were beautifulthey heard the sound of voices behind thempeter the valet who was now wide awake had roused the doctortimokhin who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg hadlong been watching all that was going on carefully covering his barebody with the sheet as he huddled up on his benchwhats this said the doctor rising from his bed please go awaymadamat that moment a maid sent by the countess who had noticed herdaughters absence knocked at the doorlike a somnambulist aroused from her sleep natasha went out of the roomand returning to her hut fell sobbing on her bedfrom that time during all the rest of the rostovs journey at everyhalting place and wherever they spent a night natasha never left thewounded bolkonski and the doctor had to admit that he had not expectedfrom a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing awounded mandreadful as the countess imagined it would be should prince andrew diein her daughters arms during the journeyas judging by what thedoctor said it seemed might easily happenshe could not opposenatasha though with the intimacy now established between the woundedman and natasha the thought occurred that should he recover their formerengagement would be renewed no oneleast of all natasha and princeandrewspoke of this the unsettled question of life and death whichhung not only over bolkonski but over all russia shut out all otherconsiderationson the third of september pierre awoke late his head was aching theclothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable onhis body and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful hehad done the day before that something shameful was his yesterdaysconversation with captain ramballeit was eleven by the clock but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doorspierre rose rubbed his eyes and seeing the pistol with an engravedstock which gerasim had replaced on the writing table he rememberedwhere he was and what lay before him that very dayam i not too late he thought no probably he wont make his entryinto moscow before noonpierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him buthastened to actafter arranging his clothes he took the pistol and was about to go outbut it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly couldnot carry the weapon in his hand through the streets it was difficultto hide such a big pistol even under his wide coat he could not carryit unnoticed in his belt or under his arm besides it had beendischarged and he had not had time to reload it no matter daggerwill do he said to himself though when planning his design he hadmore than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by thestudent in  had been to try to kill napoleon with a dagger but ashis chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design but in provingto himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all hecould to achieve it pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in agreen sheath which he had bought at the sukharev market with the pistoland hid it under his waistcoathaving tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his headpierre went down the corridor trying to avoid making a noise or meetingthe captain and passed out into the streetthe conflagration at which he had looked with so much indifference theevening before had greatly increased during the night moscow was onfire in several places the buildings in carriage row across the riverin the bazaar and the povarskoy as well as the barges on the moskvariver and the timber yards by the dorogomilov bridge were all ablazepierres way led through side streets to the povarskoy and from there tothe church of st nicholas on the arbat where he had long beforedecided that the deed should be done the gates of most of the houseswere locked and the shutters up the streets and lanes were desertedthe air was full of smoke and the smell of burning now and then he metrussians with anxious and timid faces and frenchmen with an air not ofthe city but of the camp walking in the middle of the streets both therussians and the french looked at pierre with surprise besides hisheight and stoutness and the strange morose look of suffering in hisface and whole figure the russians stared at pierre because they couldnot make out to what class he could belong the french followed him withastonishment in their eyes chiefly because pierre unlike all the otherrussians who gazed at the french with fear and curiosity paid noattention to them at the gate of one house three frenchmen who wereexplaining something to some russians who did not understand themstopped pierre asking if he did not know frenchpierre shook his head and went on in another side street a sentinelstanding beside a green caisson shouted at him but only when the shoutwas threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the mans musket ashe raised it did pierre understand that he had to pass on the other sideof the street he heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on aroundhim he carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste likesomething dreadful and alien to him for after the previous nightsexperience he was afraid of losing it but he was not destined to bringhis mood safely to his destination and even had he not been hindered byanything on the way his intention could not now have been carried outfor napoleon had passed the arbat more than four hours previously on hisway from the dorogomilov suburb to the kremlin and was now sitting in avery gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the kremlin givingdetailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately toextinguish the fire to prevent looting and to reassure theinhabitants but pierre did not know this he was entirely absorbed inwhat lay before him and was torturedas those are who obstinatelyundertake a task that is impossible for them not because of itsdifficulty but because of its incompatibility with their naturesby thefear of weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his selfesteemthough he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by instinctand did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the povarskoyas pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and denserheeven felt the heat of the fire occasionally curly tongues of flame rosefrom under the roofs of the houses he met more people in the streetsand they were more excited but pierre though he felt that somethingunusual was happening around him did not realize that he wasapproaching the fire as he was going along a foot path across a wideopen space adjoining the povarskoy on one side and the gardens of princegruzinskis house on the other pierre suddenly heard the desperateweeping of a woman close to him he stopped as if awakening from a dreamand lifted his headby the side of the path on the dusty dry grass all sorts of householdgoods lay in a heap featherbeds a samovar icons and trunks on theground beside the trunks sat a thin woman no longer young with longprominent upper teeth and wearing a black cloak and cap this womanswaying to and fro and muttering something was choking with sobs twogirls of about ten and twelve dressed in dirty short frocks and cloakswere staring at their mother with a look of stupefaction on their palefrightened faces the youngest child a boy of about seven who wore anovercoat and an immense cap evidently not his own was crying in his oldnurses arms a dirty barefooted maid was sitting on a trunk andhaving undone her palecolored plait was pulling it straight andsniffing at her singed hair the womans husband a short roundshouldered man in the undress uniform of a civilian official withsausageshaped whiskers and showing under his squareset cap the hairsmoothly brushed forward over his temples with expressionless face wasmoving the trunks which were placed one on another and was draggingsome garments from under themas soon as she saw pierre the woman almost threw herself at his feetdear people good christians save me help me dear friends helpus somebody she muttered between her sobs my girl my daughtermy youngest daughter is left behind shes burned ooh was it for thisi nursed you oohdont mary nikolievna said her husband to her in a low voiceevidently only to justify himself before the stranger sister must havetaken her or else where can she be he addedmonster villain shouted the woman angrily suddenly ceasing to weepyou have no heart you dont feel for your own child another man wouldhave rescued her from the fire but this is a monster and neither a mannor a father you honored sir are a noble man she went onaddressing pierre rapidly between her sobs the fire broke outalongside and blew our way the maid called out fire and we rushedto collect our things we ran out just as we were this is what wehave brought away the icons and my dowry bed all the rest is lostwe seized the children but not katie ooh o lord and again shebegan to sob my child my dear one burned burnedbut where was she left asked pierrefrom the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this manmight help heroh dear sir she cried seizing him by the legs my benefactor setmy heart at ease aniska go you horrid girl show him the way shecried to the maid angrily opening her mouth and still farther exposingher long teethshow me the way show me i ill do it gasped pierre rapidlythe dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk put up her plaitsighed and went on her short bare feet along the path pierre felt asif he had come back to life after a heavy swoon he held his headhigher his eyes shone with the light of life and with swift steps hefollowed the maid overtook her and came out on the povarskoy thewhole street was full of clouds of black smoke tongues of flame hereand there broke through that cloud a great number of people crowded infront of the conflagration in the middle of the street stood a frenchgeneral saying something to those around him pierre accompanied by themaid was advancing to the spot where the general stood but the frenchsoldiers stopped himon ne passe pas  cried a voice you cant passthis way uncle cried the girl well pass through the side streetby the nikulinspierre turned back giving a spring now and then to keep up with hershe ran across the street turned down a side street to the left andpassing three houses turned into a yard on the rightits here close by said she and running across the yard opened agate in a wooden fence and stopping pointed out to him a small woodenwing of the house which was burning brightly and fiercely one of itssides had fallen in another was on fire and bright flames issued fromthe openings of the windows and from under the roofas pierre passed through the fence gate he was enveloped by hot air andinvoluntarily stoppedwhich is it which is your house he askedooh wailed the girl pointing to the wing thats it that was ourlodging youve burned to death our treasure katie my precious littlemissy ooh lamented aniska who at the sight of the fire felt that shetoo must give expression to her feelingspierre rushed to the wing but the heat was so great that heinvoluntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house thatwas as yet burning only at one end just below the roof and aroundwhich swarmed a crowd of frenchmen at first pierre did not realize whatthese men who were dragging something out were about but seeingbefore him a frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and tryingto take from him a foxfur coat he vaguely understood that looting wasgoing on there but he had no time to dwell on that ideathe sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings thewhistle and hiss of the flames the excited shouts of the people andthe sight of the swaying smoke now gathering into thick black cloudsand now soaring up with glittering sparks with here and there densesheaves of flame now red and now like golden fish scales creeping alongthe walls and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion produced onpierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration it had apeculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felthimself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down he feltyoung bright adroit and resolute he ran round to the other side ofthe lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was stillstanding when just above his head he heard several voices shouting andthen a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling closebeside himpierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some frenchmenwho had just thrown out the drawer of a chest filled with metalarticles other french soldiers standing below went up to the drawerwhat does this fellow want shouted one of them referring to pierretheres a child in that house havent you seen a child cried pierrewhats he talking about get along said several voices and one ofthe soldiers evidently afraid that pierre might want to take from themsome of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer movedthreateningly toward hima child shouted a frenchman from above i did hear somethingsquealing in the garden perhaps its his brat that the fellow islooking for after all one must be human you knowwhere is it where said pierrethere there shouted the frenchman at the window pointing to thegarden at the back of the house wait a bitim coming downand a minute or two later the frenchman a blackeyed fellow with a spoton his cheek in shirt sleeves really did jump out of a window on theground floor and clapping pierre on the shoulder ran with him into thegardenhurry up you others he called out to his comrades its gettinghotwhen they reached a gravel path behind the house the frenchman pulledpierre by the arm and pointed to a round graveled space where a threeyearold girl in a pink dress was lying under a seatthere is your child oh a girl so much the better said thefrenchman goodbye fatty we must be human we are all mortal youknow and the frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to hiscomradesbreathless with joy pierre ran to the little girl and was going to takeher in his arms but seeing a stranger the sickly scrofulouslookingchild unattractively like her mother began to yell and run awaypierre however seized her and lifted her in his arms she screameddesperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull pierreshands away and to bite them with her slobbering mouth pierre was seizedby a sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced whentouching some nasty little animal but he made an effort not to throwthe child down and ran with her to the large house it was now howeverimpossible to get back the way he had come the maid aniska was nolonger there and pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed thewet painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and ranwith her through the garden seeking another way outhaving run through different yards and side streets pierre got backwith his little burden to the gruzinski garden at the corner of thepovarskoy he did not at first recognize the place from which he had setout to look for the child so crowded was it now with people and goodsthat had been dragged out of the houses besides russian families whohad taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings there wereseveral french soldiers in a variety of clothing pierre took no noticeof them he hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order torestore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else pierrefelt that he had still much to do and to do quickly glowing with theheat and from running he felt at that moment more strongly than everthe sense of youth animation and determination that had come on himwhen he ran to save the child she had now become quiet and clingingwith her little hands to pierres coat sat on his arm gazing about herlike some little wild animal he glanced at her occasionally with aslight smile he fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in thatfrightened sickly little facehe did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left them hewalked among the crowd with rapid steps scanning the various faces hemet involuntarily he noticed a georgian or armenian family consistingof a very handsome old man of oriental type wearing a new clothcovered sheepskin coat and new boots an old woman of similar type anda young woman that very young woman seemed to pierre the perfection oforiental beauty with her sharply outlined arched black eyebrows andthe extraordinarily soft bright color of her long beautifulexpressionless face amid the scattered property and the crowd on theopen space she in her rich satin cloak with a bright lilac shawl onher head suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out onto the snowshe was sitting on some bundles a little behind the old woman andlooked from under her long lashes with motionless large almondshapedeyes at the ground before her evidently she was aware of her beauty andfearful because of it her face struck pierre and hurrying along by thefence he turned several times to look at her when he had reached thefence still without finding those he sought he stopped and lookedabout himwith the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous thanbefore and a group of russians both men and women gathered about himhave you lost anyone my dear fellow youre of the gentry yourselfarent you whose child is it they asked himpierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat whohad been sitting there with her other children and he asked whetheranyone knew where she had gonewhy that must be the anferovs said an old deacon addressing apockmarked peasant woman lord have mercy lord have mercy he addedin his customary bassthe anferovs no said the woman they left in the morning that mustbe either mary nikolievnas or the ivanovshe says a woman and mary nikolievna is a lady remarked a houseserfdo you know her shes thin with long teeth said pierrethats mary nikolievna they went inside the garden when these wolvesswooped down said the woman pointing to the french soldierso lord have mercy added the deacongo over that way theyre there its she she kept on lamenting andcrying continued the woman its she here this waybut pierre was not listening to the woman he had for some seconds beenintently watching what was going on a few steps away he was looking atthe armenian family and at two french soldiers who had gone up to themone of these a nimble little man was wearing a blue coat tied roundthe waist with a rope he had a nightcap on his head and his feet werebare the other whose appearance particularly struck pierre was along lank roundshouldered fairhaired man slow in his movements andwith an idiotic expression of face he wore a womans loose gown offrieze blue trousers and large torn hessian boots the littlebarefooted frenchman in the blue coat went up to the armenians andsaying something immediately seized the old man by his legs and the oldman at once began pulling off his boots the other in the frieze gownstopped in front of the beautiful armenian girl and with his hands inhis pockets stood staring at her motionless and silenthere take the child said pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to thewoman handing the little girl to her give her back to them give herback he almost shouted putting the child who began screaming on theground and again looking at the frenchman and the armenian familythe old man was already sitting barefoot the little frenchman hadsecured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other theold man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs but pierrecaught but a glimpse of this his whole attention was directed to thefrenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile swaying slowly from side toside had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands from hispockets had seized her by the neckthe beautiful armenian still sat motionless and in the same attitudewith her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or feel what thesoldier was doing to herwhile pierre was running the few steps that separated him from thefrenchman the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing fromher neck the necklace the young armenian was wearing and the youngwoman clutching at her neck screamed piercinglylet that woman alone exclaimed pierre hoarsely in a furious voiceseizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him asidethe soldier fell got up and ran away but his comrade throwing downthe boots and drawing his sword moved threateningly toward pierrevoyons pas de betises  he cried look here no nonsensepierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing andhis strength increased tenfold he rushed at the barefooted frenchmanand before the latter had time to draw his sword knocked him off hisfeet and hammered him with his fists shouts of approval were heard fromthe crowd around and at the same moment a mounted patrol of frenchuhlans appeared from round the corner the uhlans came up at a trot topierre and the frenchman and surrounded them pierre remembered nothingof what happened after that he only remembered beating someone andbeing beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that acrowd of french soldiers stood around him and were searching himlieutenant he has a dagger were the first words pierre understoodah a weapon said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldierwho had been arrested with pierre all right you can tell all about itat the courtmartial then he turned to pierre do you speak frenchpierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply his faceprobably looked very terrible for the officer said something in awhisper and four more uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves onboth sides of pierredo you speak french the officer asked again keeping at a distancefrom pierre call the interpretera little man in russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks and byhis clothes and manner of speaking pierre at once knew him to be afrench salesman from one of the moscow shopshe does not look like a common

withresolute and triumphant steps between the french soldiersthe french patrol was one of those sent out through the various streetsof moscow by durosnels order to put a stop to the pillage andespecially to catch the incendiaries who according to the generalopinion which had that day originated among the higher french officerswere the cause of the conflagrations after marching through a number ofstreets the patrol arrested five more russian suspects a smallshopkeeper two seminary students a peasant and a house serf besidesseveral looters but of all these various suspected characters pierrewas considered to be the most suspicious of all when they had all beenbrought for the night to a large house on the zubov rampart that wasbeing used as a guardhouse pierre was placed apart under strict guardin petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being carried onwith greater heat than ever in the highest circles between the partiesof rumyantsev the french marya fedorovna the tsarevich and othersdrowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones but the calmluxurious life of petersburg concerned only about phantoms andreflections of real life went on in its old way and made it hardexcept by a great effort to realize the danger and the difficultposition of the russian people there were the same receptions andballs the same french theater the same court interests and serviceinterests and intrigues as usual only in the very highest circles wereattempts made to keep in mind the difficulties of the actual positionstories were whispered of how differently the two empresses behaved inthese difficult circumstances the empress marya concerned for thewelfare of the charitable and educational institutions under herpatronage had given directions that they should all be removed tokazan and the things belonging to these institutions had already beenpacked up the empress elisabeth however when asked what instructionsshe would be pleased to givewith her characteristic russian patriotismhad replied that she could give no directions about state institutionsfor that was the affair of the sovereign but as far as she personallywas concerned she would be the last to quit petersburgat anna pavlovnas on the twentysixth of august the very day of thebattle of borodino there was a soiree the chief feature of which wasto be the reading of a letter from his lordship the bishop when sendingthe emperor an icon of the venerable sergius it was regarded as a modelof ecclesiastical patriotic eloquence prince vasili himself famed forhis elocution was to read it he used to read at the empress theart of his reading was supposed to lie in rolling out the words quiteindependently of their meaning in a loud and singsong voice alternatingbetween a despairing wail and a tender murmur so that the wail fellquite at random on one word and the murmur on another this reading aswas always the case at anna pavlovnas soirees had a politicalsignificance that evening she expected several important personages whohad to be made ashamed of their visits to the french theater and arousedto a patriotic temper a good many people had already arrived but annapavlovna not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing roomdid not let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a generalconversationthe news of the day in petersburg was the illness of countess bezukhovashe had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously had missedseveral gatherings of which she was usually ornament and was said to bereceiving no one and instead of the celebrated petersburg doctors whousually attended her had entrusted herself to some italian doctor whowas treating her in some new and unusual waythey all knew very well that the enchanting countess illness arose froman inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same timeand that the italians cure consisted in removing such inconveniencebut in anna pavlovnas presence no one dared to think of this or evenappear to know itthey say the poor countess is very ill the doctor says it is anginapectorisangina oh thats a terrible illnessthey say that the rivals are reconciled thanks to the angina andthe word angina was repeated with great satisfactionthe count is pathetic they say he cried like a child when the doctortold him the case was dangerousoh it would be a terrible loss she is an enchanting womanyou are speaking of the poor countess said anna pavlovna coming upjust then i sent to ask for news and hear that she is a littlebetter oh she is certainly the most charming woman in the world shewent on with a smile at her own enthusiasm we belong to differentcamps but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves sheis very unfortunate added anna pavlovnasupposing that by these words anna pavlovna was somewhat lifting theveil from the secret of the countess malady an unwary young manventured to express surprise that well known doctors had not been calledin and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan who mightemploy dangerous remediesyour information may be better than mine anna pavlovna suddenly andvenomously retorted on the inexperienced young man but i know on goodauthority that this doctor is a very learned and able man he is privatephysician to the queen of spainand having thus demolished the young man anna pavlovna turned toanother group where bilibin was talking about the austrians havingwrinkled up his face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out againand utter one of his motsi think it is delightful he said referring to a diplomatic note thathad been sent to vienna with some austrian banners captured from thefrench by wittgenstein the hero of petropol as he was then called inpetersburgwhat whats that asked anna pavlovna securing silence for the motwhich she had heard beforeand bilibin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch whichhe had himself composedthe emperor returns these austrian banners said bilibin friendlybanners gone astray and found on a wrong path and his brow becamesmooth againcharming charming observed prince vasilithe path to warsaw perhaps prince hippolyte remarked loudly andunexpectedly everybody looked at him understanding what he meantprince hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise he knew nomore than the others what his words meant during his diplomatic careerhe had more than once noticed that such utterances were received as verywitty and at every opportunity he uttered in that way the first wordsthat entered his head it may turn out very well he thought but ifnot theyll know how to arrange matters and really during theawkward silence that ensued that insufficiently patriotic personentered whom anna pavlovna had been waiting for and wished to convertand she smiling and shaking a finger at hippolyte invited princevasili to the table and bringing him two candles and the manuscriptbegged him to begin everyone became silentmost gracious sovereign and emperor prince vasili sternly declaimedlooking round at his audience as if to inquire whether anyone hadanything to say to the contrary but no one said anything moscow ourancient capital the new jerusalem receives her christhe placed asudden emphasis on the word heras a mother receives her zealous sonsinto her arms and through the gathering mists foreseeing the brilliantglory of thy rule sings in exultation hosanna blessed is he thatcomethprince vasili pronounced these last words in a tearful voicebilibin attentively examined his nails and many of those presentappeared intimidated as if asking in what they were to blame annapavlovna whispered the next words in advance like an old womanmuttering the prayer at communion let the bold and insolentgoliath she whisperedprince vasili continuedlet the bold and insolent goliath from the borders of france encompassthe realms of russia with deathbearing terrors humble faith the slingof the russian david shall suddenly smite his head in his bloodthirstypride this icon of the venerable sergius the servant of god andzealous champion of old of our countrys weal is offered to yourimperial majesty i grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing inthe sight of your most gracious presence i raise fervent prayers toheaven that the almighty may exalt the race of the just and mercifullyfulfill the desires of your majestywhat force what a style was uttered in approval both of reader andof authoranimated by that address anna pavlovnas guests talked for a long timeof the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as to theresult of the battle to be fought in a few daysyou will see said anna pavlovna that tomorrow on the emperorsbirthday we shall receive news i have a favorable presentimentanna pavlovnas presentiment was in fact fulfilled next day during theservice at the palace church in honor of the emperors birthday princevolkonski was called out of the church and received a dispatch fromprince kutuzov it was kutuzovs report written from tatarinova on theday of the battle kutuzov wrote that the russians had not retreated astep that the french losses were much heavier than ours and that hewas writing in haste from the field of battle before collecting fullinformation it followed that there must have been a victory and atonce without leaving the church thanks were rendered to the creatorfor his help and for the victoryanna pavlovnas presentiment was justified and all that morning ajoyously festive mood reigned in the city everyone believed the victoryto have been complete and some even spoke of napoleons having beencaptured of his deposition and of the choice of a new ruler forfranceit is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strengthand completeness amid the conditions of court life and far from thescene of action general events involuntarily group themselves aroundsome particular incident so now the courtiers pleasure was based asmuch on the fact that the news had arrived on the emperors birthday ason the fact of the victory itself it was like a successfully arrangedsurprise mention was made in kutuzovs report of the russian lossesamong which figured the names of tuchkov bagration and kutaysov inthe petersburg world this sad side of the affair again involuntarilycentered round a single incident kutaysovs death everybody knew himthe emperor liked him and he was young and interesting that dayeveryone met with the wordswhat a wonderful coincidence just during the service but what a losskutaysov is how sorry i amwhat did i tell about kutuzov prince vasili now said with a prophetspride i always said he was the only man capable of defeatingnapoleonbut next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grewanxious the courtiers suffered because of the suffering the suspenseoccasioned the emperorfancy the emperors position said they and instead of extollingkutuzov as they had done the day before they condemned him as the causeof the emperors anxiety that day prince vasili no longer boasted ofhis protege kutuzov but remained silent when the commanderinchief wasmentioned moreover toward evening as if everything conspired to makepetersburg society anxious and uneasy a terrible piece of news wasadded countess helene bezukhova had suddenly died of that terriblemalady it had been so agreeable to mention officially at largegatherings everyone said that countess bezukhova had died of a terribleattack of angina pectoris but in intimate circles details werementioned of how the private physician of the queen of spain hadprescribed small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effectbut helene tortured by the fact that the old count suspected her andthat her husband to whom she had written that wretched profligatepierre had not replied had suddenly taken a very large dose of thedrug and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her itwas said that prince vasili and the old count had turned upon theitalian but the latter had produced such letters from the unfortunatedeceased that they had immediately let the matter droptalk in general centered round three melancholy facts the emperorslack of news the loss of kutaysov and the death of heleneon the third day after kutuzovs report a country gentleman arrived frommoscow and news of the surrender of moscow to the french spread throughthe whole town this was terrible what a position for the emperor to bein kutuzov was a traitor and prince vasili during the visits ofcondolence paid to him on the occasion of his daughters death said ofkutuzov whom he had formerly praised it was excusable for him in hisgrief to forget what he had said that it was impossible to expectanything else from a blind and depraved old mani only wonder that the fate of russia could have been entrusted to sucha manas long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt itbut the next day the following communication was received from countrostopchinprince kutuzovs adjutant has brought me a letter in which he demandspolice officers to guide the army to the ryazan road he writes that heis regretfully abandoning moscow sire kutuzovs action decides thefate of the capital and of your empire russia will shudder to learn ofthe abandonment of the city in which her greatness is centered and inwhich lie the ashes of your ancestors i shall follow the army i havehad everything removed and it only remains for me to weep over the fateof my fatherlandon receiving this dispatch the emperor sent prince volkonski to kutuzovwith the following rescriptprince michael ilarionovich since the twentyninth of august i havereceived no communication from you yet on the first of september ireceived from the commanderinchief of moscow via yaroslavl the sadnews that you with the army have decided to abandon moscow you canyourself imagine the effect this news has had on me and your silenceincreases my astonishment i am sending this by adjutantgeneral princevolkonski to hear from you the situation of the army and the reasonsthat have induced you to take this melancholy decisionnine days after the abandonment of moscow a messenger from kutuzovreached petersburg with the official announcement of that event thismessenger was michaud a frenchman who did not know russian but who wasquoique etranger russe de coeur et dame  as he said of himself though a foreigner russian in heart and soulthe emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the palaceon stone island michaud who had never seen moscow before the campaignand who did not know russian yet felt deeply moved as he wrote whenhe appeared before notre tres gracieux souverain  with the news of theburning of moscow dont les flammes eclairaient sa route  our most gracious sovereign  whose flames illumined his routethough the source of m michauds chagrin must have been different fromthat which caused russians to grieve he had such a sad face when showninto the emperors study that the latter at once askedhave you brought me sad news colonelvery sad sire replied michaud lowering his eyes with a sigh theabandonment of moscowhave they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle asked theemperor quickly his face suddenly flushingmichaud respectfully delivered the message kutuzov had entrusted to himwhich was that it had been impossible to fight before moscow and thatas the only remaining choice was between losing the army as well asmoscow or losing moscow alone the field marshal had to choose thelatterthe emperor listened in silence not looking at michaudhas the enemy entered the city he askedyes sire and moscow is now in ashes i left it all in flamesreplied michaud in a decided tone but glancing at the emperor he wasfrightened by what he had donethe emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly his lower liptrembled and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyesbut this lasted only a moment he suddenly frowned as if blaminghimself for his weakness and raising his head addressed michaud in afirm voicei see colonel from all that is happening that providence requiresgreat sacrifices of us i am ready to submit myself in all things tohis will but tell me michaud how did you leave the army when it sawmy ancient capital abandoned without a battle did you not noticediscouragementseeing that his most gracious ruler was calm once more michaud alsogrew calm but was not immediately ready to reply to the emperorsdirect and relevant question which required a direct answersire will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier heasked to gain timecolonel i always require it replied the emperor conceal nothingfrom me i wish to know absolutely how things aresire said michaud with a subtle scarcely perceptible smile on hislips having now prepared a wellphrased reply sire i left the wholearmy from its chiefs to the lowest soldier without exception indesperate and agonized terrorhow is that the emperor interrupted him frowning sternly wouldmisfortune make my russians lose heart nevermichaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he hadpreparedsire he said with respectful playfulness they are only afraid lestyour majesty in the goodness of your heart should allow yourself to bepersuaded to make peace they are burning for the combat declared thisrepresentative of the russian nation and to prove to your majesty bythe sacrifice of their lives how devoted they areah said the emperor reassured and with a kindly gleam in his eyeshe patted michaud on the shoulder you set me at ease colonelhe bent his head and was silent for some timewell then go back to the army he said drawing himself up to hisfull height and addressing michaud with a gracious and majestic gestureand tell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you go thatwhen i have not a soldier left i shall put myself at the head of mybeloved nobility and my good peasants and so use the last resources ofmy empire it still offers me more than my enemies suppose said theemperor growing more and more animated but should it ever be ordainedby divine providence he continued raising to heaven his fine eyesshining with emotion that my dynasty should cease to reign on thethrone of my ancestors then after exhausting all the means at mycommand i shall let my beard grow to here he pointed halfway down hischest and go and eat potatoes with the meanest of my peasants ratherthan sign the disgrace of my country and of my beloved people whosesacrifices i know how to appreciatehaving uttered these words in an agitated voice the emperor suddenlyturned away as if to hide from michaud the tears that rose to his eyesand went to the further end of his study having stood there a fewmoments he strode back to michaud and pressed his arm below the elbowwith a vigorous movement the emperors mild and handsome face wasflushed and his eyes gleamed with resolution and angercolonel michaud do not forget what i say to you here perhaps we mayrecall it with pleasure someday napoleon or i said the emperortouching his breast we can no longer both reign together i havelearned to know him and he will not deceive me any moreand the emperor paused with a frownwhen he heard these words and saw the expression of firm resolution inthe emperors eyes michaudquoique etranger russe de coeur et dameat that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all that he had heardas he used afterwards to say and gave expression to his own feelingsand those of the russian people whose representative he consideredhimself to be in the following wordssire said he your majesty is at this moment signing the glory ofthe nation and the salvation of europewith an inclination of the head the emperor dismissed himit is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine thatwhen half russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were fleeing todistant provinces and one levy after another was being raised for thedefense of the fatherland all russians from the greatest to the leastwere solely engaged in sacrificing themselves saving their fatherlandor weeping over its downfall the tales and descriptions of that timewithout exception speak only of the selfsacrifice patriotic devotiondespair grief and the heroism of the russians but it was not reallyso it appears so to us because we see only the general historicinterest of that time and do not see all the personal human intereststhat people had yet in reality those personal interests of the momentso much transcend the general interests that they always prevent thepublic interest from being felt or even noticed most of the people atthat time paid no attention to the general progress of events but wereguided only by their private interests and they were the very peoplewhose activities at that period were most usefulthose who tried to understand the general course of events and to takepart in it by selfsacrifice and heroism were the most useless membersof society they saw everything upside down and all they did for thecommon good turned out to be useless and foolishlike pierres andmamonovs regiments which looted russian villages and the lint theyoung ladies prepared and that never reached the wounded and so oneven those fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelingswho discussed russias position at the time involuntarily introducedinto their conversation either a shade of pretense and falsehood oruseless condemnation and anger directed against people accused ofactions no one could possibly be guilty of in historic events the ruleforbidding us to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge is speciallyapplicable only unconscious action bears fruit and he who plays a partin an historic event never understands its significance if he tries torealize it his efforts are fruitlessthe more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place inrussia the less did he realize their significance in petersburg and inthe provinces at a distance from moscow ladies and gentlemen inmilitia uniforms wept for russia and its ancient capital and talked ofselfsacrifice and so on but in the army which retired beyond moscowthere was little talk or thought of moscow and when they caught sightof its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the french but theythought about their next pay their next quarters of matreshka thevivandiere and like mattersas the war had caught him in the service nicholas rostov took a closeand prolonged part in the defense of his country but did so casuallywithout any aim at selfsacrifice and he therefore looked at what wasgoing on in russia without despair and without dismally racking hisbrains over it had he been asked what he thought of the state ofrussia he would have said that it was not his business to think aboutit that kutuzov and others were there for that purpose but that he hadheard that the regiments were to be made up to their full strength thatfighting would probably go on for a long time yet and that things beingso it was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a coupleof years timeas he looked at the matter in this way he learned that he was beingsent to voronezh to buy remounts for his division not only withoutregret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle butwith the greatest pleasurewhich he did not conceal and which hiscomrades fully understooda few days before the battle of borodino nicholas received thenecessary money and warrants and having sent some hussars on inadvance he set out with post horses for voronezhonly a man who has experienced itthat is has passed some monthscontinuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and warcan understand thedelight nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by thearmys foraging operations provision trains and hospitals whenfreefrom soldiers wagons and the filthy traces of a camphe saw villageswith peasants and peasant women gentlemens country houses fieldswhere cattle were grazing posthouses with stationmasters asleep inthem he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time what fora long while specially surprised and delighted him were the women youngand healthy without a dozen officers making up to each of them womentoo who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should jokewith themin the highest spirits nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in voronezhordered things he had long been deprived of in camp and next day verycleanshaven and in a fulldress uniform he had not worn for a longtime went to present himself to the authoritiesthe commander of the militia was a civilian general an old man who wasevidently pleased with his military designation and rank he receivednicholas brusquely imagining this to be characteristically militaryand questioned him with an important air as if considering the generalprogress of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to doso nicholas was in such good spirits that this merely amused himfrom the commander of the militia he drove to the governor the governorwas a brisk little man very simple and affable he indicated the studfarms at which nicholas might procure horses recommended to him a horsedealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who hadthe best horses and promised to assist him in every wayyou are count ilya rostovs son my wife was a great friend of yourmothers we are at home on thursdaystoday is thursday so please comeand see us quite informally said the governor taking leave of himimmediately on leaving the governors nicholas hired post horses andtaking his squadron quartermaster with him drove at a gallop to thelandowner fourteen miles away who had the stud everything seemed tohim pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in voronezhand as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mindeverything went well and easilythe landowner to whom nicholas went was a bachelor an old cavalryman ahorse fancier a sportsman the possessor of some centuryold brandy andsome old hungarian wine who had a snuggery where he smoked and whoowned some splendid horsesin very few words nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for sixthousand rublesto serve as he said as samples of his remounts afterdining and taking rather too much of the hungarian wine nicholashaving exchanged kisses with the landowner with whom he was already onthe friendliest termsgalloped back over abominable roads in thebrightest frame of mind continually urging on the driver so as to be intime for the governors partywhen he had changed poured water over his head and scented himselfnicholas arrived at the governors rather late but with the phrasebetter late than never on his lipsit was not a ball nor had dancing been announced but everyone knewthat catherine petrovna would play valses and the ecossaise on theclavichord and that there would be dancing and so everyone had come asto a ballprovincial life in  went on very much as usual but with thisdifference that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of thearrival of many wealthy families from moscow and as in everything thatwent on in russia at that time a special recklessness was noticeable anin for a penny in for a poundwho cares spirit and the inevitablesmall talk instead of turning on the weather and mutual acquaintancesnow turned on moscow the army and napoleonthe society gathered together at the governors was the best invoronezhthere were a great many ladies and some of nicholas moscowacquaintances but there were no men who could at all vie with thecavalier of st george the hussar remount officer the goodnatured andwellbred count rostov among the men was an italian prisoner anofficer of the french army and nicholas felt that the presence of thatprisoner enhanced his own importance as a russian hero the italian wasas it were a war trophy nicholas felt this it seemed to him thateveryone regarded the italian in the same light and he treated himcordially though with dignity and restraintas soon as nicholas entered in his hussar uniform diffusing around hima fragrance of perfume and wine and had uttered the words better latethan never and heard them repeated several times by others peopleclustered around him all eyes turned on him and he felt at once thathe had entered into his proper position in the provincethat of auniversal favorite a very pleasant position and intoxicatingly soafter his long privations at posting stations at inns and in thelandowners snuggery maidservants had been flattered by his notice andhere too at the governors party there were as it seemed to nicholasan inexhaustible number of pretty young women married and unmarriedimpatiently awaiting his notice the women and girls flirted with himand from the first day the people concerned themselves to get thisfine young daredevil of an hussar married and settled down among thesewas the governors wife herself who welcomed rostov as a near relativeand called him nicholascatherine petrovna did actually play valses and the ecossaise anddancing began in which nicholas still further captivated the provincialsociety by his agility his particularly free manner of dancing evensurprised them all nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way hedanced that evening he had never danced like that in moscow and wouldeven have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and inbad form but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all bysomething unusual something they would have to accept as the regularthing in the capital though new to them in the provincesall the evening nicholas paid attention to a blueeyed plump andpleasing little blonde the wife of one of the provincial officialswith the naive conviction of young men in a merry mood that other menswives were created for them rostov did not leave the ladys side andtreated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style as ifwithout speaking of it they knew how capitally nicholas and the ladywould get on together the husband however did not seem to share thatconviction and tried to behave morosely with rostov but the lattersgoodnatured naivete was so boundless that sometimes even heinvoluntarily yielded to nicholas good humor toward the end of theevening however as the wifes face grew more flushed and animated thehusbands became more and more melancholy and solemn as though therewere but a given amount of animation between them and as the wifesshare increased the husbands diminishednicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair bending closelyover the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments with asmile that never left his face jauntily shifting the position of hislegs in their tight riding breeches diffusing an odor of perfume andadmiring his partner himself and the fine outlines of his legs intheir wellfitting hessian boots nicholas told the blonde lady that hewished to run away with a certain lady here in voronezhwhich ladya charming lady a divine one her eyes nicholas looked at hispartner are blue her mouth coral and ivory her figure he glancedat her shoulders like dianasthe husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talkingaboutah nikita ivanych cried nicholas rising politely and as if wishingnikita ivanych to share his joke he began to tell him of his intentionto elope with a blonde ladythe husband smiled gloomily the wife gaily the governors goodnaturedwife came up with a look of disapprovalanna ignatyevna wants to see you nicholas said she pronouncing thename so that nicholas at once understood that anna ignatyevna was a veryimportant person come nicholas you know you let me call you sooh yes aunt who is sheanna ignatyevna malvintseva she has heard from her niece how yourescued her can you guessi rescued such a lot of them said nicholasher niece princess bolkonskaya she is here in voronezh with her auntoho how you blush why arenot a bit please dont auntvery well very well oh what a fellow you arethe governors wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with ablue headdress who had just finished her game of cards with the mostimportant personages of the town this was malvintseva princess marysaunt on her mothers side a rich childless widow who always lived invoronezh when rostov approached her she was standing settling up forthe game she looked at him and screwing up her eyes sternly continuedto upbraid the general who had won from hervery pleased mon cher she then said holding out her hand tonicholas pray come and see meafter a few words about princess mary and her late father whommalvintseva had evidently not liked and having asked what nicholas knewof prince andrew who also was evidently no favorite of hers theimportant old lady dismissed nicholas after repeating her invitation tocome to see hernicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed at the mentionof princess mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fearwhich he himself did not understandwhen he had parted from malvintseva nicholas wished to return to thedancing but the governors little wife placed her plump hand on hissleeve and saying that she wanted to have a talk with him led him toher sitting room from which those who were there immediately withdrewso as not to be in her waydo you know dear boy began the governors wife with a seriousexpression on her kind little face that really would be the match foryou would you like me to arrange itwhom do you mean aunt asked nicholasi will make a match for you with the princess catherine petrovnaspeaks of lily but i say nothe princess do you want me to do it iam sure your mother will be grateful to me what a charming girl she isreally and she is not at all so plain eithernot at all replied nicholas as if offended at the idea as befits asoldier aunt i dont force myself on anyone or refuse anything hesaid before he had time to consider what he was sayingwell then remember this is not a jokeof course notyes yes the governors wife said as if talking to herself but mydear boy among other things you are too attentive to the other theblonde one is sorry for the husband reallyoh no we are good friends with him said nicholas in the simplicityof his heart it did not enter his head that a pastime so pleasant tohimself might not be pleasant to someone elsebut what nonsense i have been saying to the governors wife thoughtnicholas suddenly at supper she will really begin to arrange amatch and sonya and on taking leave of the governors wife whenshe again smilingly said to him well then remember he drew herasidebut see here to tell the truth auntwhat is it my dear come lets sit down here said shenicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimatethoughts which he would not have told to his mother his sister or hisfriend to this woman who was almost a stranger when he afterwardsrecalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness whichhad very important results for him it seemed to himas it seems toeveryone in such casesthat it was merely some silly whim that seizedhim yet that burst of frankness together with other trifling eventshad immense consequences for him and for all his familyyou see aunt mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress but thevery idea of marrying for money is repugnant to meoh yes i understand said the governors wifebut princess bolkonskayathats another matter i will tell you thetruth in the first place i like her very much i feel drawn to her andthen after i met her under such circumstancesso strangely the ideaoften occurred to me this is fate especially if you remember thatmamma had long been thinking of it but i had never happened to meet herbefore somehow it had always happened that we did not meet and as longas my sister natasha was engaged to her brother it was of course out ofthe question for me to think of marrying her and it must needs happenthat i should meet her just when natashas engagement had been brokenoff and then everything so you see i never told this to anyoneand never will only to youthe governors wife pressed his elbow gratefullyyou know sonya my cousin i love her and promised to marry her andwill do so so you see there can be no question about said nicholasincoherently and blushingmy dear boy what a way to look at it you know sonya has nothing andyou yourself say your papas affairs are in a very bad way and whatabout your mother it would kill her thats one thing and what sort oflife would it be for sonyaif shes a girl with a heart your mother indespair and you all ruined no my dear you and sonya ought tounderstand thatnicholas remained silent it comforted him to hear these argumentsall the same aunt it is impossible he rejoined with a sigh after ashort pause besides would the princess have me and besides she isnow in mourning how can one think of itbut you dont suppose im going to get you married at once there isalways a right way of doing things replied the governors wifewhat a matchmaker you are aunt said nicholas kissing her plumplittle handon reaching moscow after her meeting with rostov princess mary hadfound her nephew there with his tutor and a letter from prince andrewgiving her instructions how to get to her aunt malvintseva at voronezhthat feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her during herfathers illness since his death and especially since her meeting withrostov was smothered by arrangements for the journey anxiety about herbrother settling in a new house meeting new people and attending toher nephews education she was sad now after a month passed in quietsurroundings she felt more and more deeply the loss of her father whichwas associated in her mind with the ruin of russia she was agitated andincessantly tortured by the thought of the dangers to which her brotherthe only intimate person now remaining to her was exposed she wasworried too about her nephews education for which she had always feltherself incompetent but in the depths of her soul she felt at peaceapeace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreamsand hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her and wererelated to her meeting with rostovthe day after her party the governors wife came to see malvintseva andafter discussing her plan with the aunt remarked that though underpresent circumstances a formal betrothal was of course not to bethought of all the same the young people might be brought together andcould get to know one another malvintseva expressed approval and thegovernors wife began to speak of rostov in marys presence praisinghim and telling how he had blushed when princess marys name wasmentioned but princess mary experienced a painful rather than a joyfulfeelingher mental tranquillity was destroyed and desires doubtsselfreproach and hopes reawokeduring the two days that elapsed before rostov called princess marycontinually thought of how she ought to behave to him first she decidednot to come to the drawing room when he called to see her auntthat itwould not be proper for her in her deep mourning to receive visitorsthen she thought this would be rude after what he had done for her thenit occurred to her that her aunt and the governors wife had intentionsconcerning herself and rostovtheir looks and words at times seemed toconfirm this suppositionthen she told herself that only she with hersinful nature could think this of them they could not forget thatsituated as she was while still wearing deep mourning such matchmakingwould be an insult to her and to her fathers memory assuming that shedid go down to see him princess mary imagined the words he would say toher and what she would say to him and these words sometimes seemedundeservedly cold and then to mean too much more than anything shefeared lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her assoon as she saw himbut when on sunday after church the footman announced in the drawingroom that count rostov had called the princess showed no confusiononly a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a newand radiant lightyou have met him aunt said she in a calm voice unable herself tounderstand that she could be outwardly so calm and naturalwhen rostov entered the room the princess dropped her eyes for aninstant as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt and then justas nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look withshining eyes with a movement full of dignity and grace she half rosewith a smile of pleasure held out her slender delicate hand to himand began to speak in a voice in which for the first time new deepwomanly notes vibrated mademoiselle bourienne who was in the drawingroom looked at princess mary in bewildered surprise herself aconsummate coquette she could not have maneuvered better on meeting aman she wished to attracteither black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatlyimproved without my having noticed it and above all what tact andgrace thought mademoiselle bouriennehad princess mary been capable of reflection at that moment she wouldhave been more surprised than mademoiselle bourienne at the change thathad taken place in herself from the moment she recognized that dearloved face a new life force took possession of her and compelled her tospeak and act apart from her own will from the time rostov entered herface became suddenly transformed it was as if a light had been kindledin a carved and painted lantern and the intricate skillful artisticwork on its sides that previously seemed dark coarse and meaninglesswas suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty for the firsttime all that pure spiritual inward travail through which she hadlived appeared on the surface all her inward labor her dissatisfactionwith herself her sufferings her strivings after goodness hermeekness love and selfsacrificeall this now shone in those radianteyes in her delicate smile and in every trait of her gentle facerostov saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life hefelt that the being before him was quite different from and betterthan anyone he had met before and above all better than himselftheir conversation was very simple and unimportant they spoke of thewar and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow aboutit they spoke of their last meetingnicholas trying to change thesubjectthey talked of the governors kind wife of nicholasrelations and of princess marysshe did not talk about her brother diverting the conversation as soonas her aunt mentioned andrew evidently she could speak of russiasmisfortunes with a certain artificiality but her brother was too nearher heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him nicholasnoticed this as he noticed every shade of princess marys characterwith an observation unusual to him and everything confirmed hisconviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary beingnicholas blushed and was confused when people spoke to him about theprincess as she did when he was mentioned and even when he thought ofher but in her presence he felt quite at ease and said not at all whathe had prepared but what quite appropriately occurred to him at themomentwhen a pause occurred during his short visit nicholas as is usual whenthere are children turned to prince andrews little son caressing himand asking whether he would like to be an hussar he took the boy on hisknee played with him and looked round at princess mary with asoftened happy timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms ofthe man she loved nicholas also noticed that look and as ifunderstanding it flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy withgood natured playfulnessas she was in mourning princess mary did not go out into society andnicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again but allthe same the governors wife went on with her matchmaking passing on tonicholas the flattering things princess mary said of him and vice versaand insisting on his declaring himself to princess mary for thispurpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at the bishopshouse before massthough rostov told the governors wife that he would not make anydeclaration to princess mary he promised to goas at tilsit rostov had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybodyconsidered right was right so now after a short but sincere strugglebetween his effort to arrange his life by his own sense of justice andin obedient submission to circumstances he chose the latter and yieldedto the power he felt irresistibly carrying him he knew not where heknew that after his promise to sonya it would be what he deemed base todeclare his feelings to princess mary and he knew that he would neveract basely but he also knew or rather felt at the bottom of his heartthat by resigning himself now to the force of circumstances and to thosewho were guiding him he was not only doing nothing wrong but was doingsomething very importantmore important than anything he had ever donein his lifeafter meeting princess mary though the course of his life went onexternally as before all his former amusements lost their charm for himand he often thought about her but he never thought about her as he hadthought of all the young ladies without exception whom he had met insociety nor as he had for a long time and at one time rapturouslythought about sonya he had pictured each of those young ladies asalmost all honesthearted young men do that is as a possible wifeadapting her in his imagination to all the conditions of married life awhite dressing gown his wife at the tea table his wifes carriagelittle ones mamma and papa their relations to her and so onandthese pictures of the future had given him pleasure but with princessmary to whom they were trying to get him engaged he could neverpicture anything of future married life if he tried his picturesseemed incongruous and false it made him afraidthe dreadful news of the battle of borodino of our losses in killed andwounded and the still more terrible news of the loss of moscow reachedvoronezh in the middle of september princess mary having learned ofher brothers wound only from the gazette and having no definite news ofhim prepared so nicholas heard he had not seen her again himself toset off in search of prince andrewwhen he received the news of the battle of borodino and the abandonmentof moscow rostov was not seized with despair anger the desire forvengeance or any feeling of that kind but everything in voronezhsuddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome and he experienced anindefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness the conversations he heardseemed to him insincere he did not know how to judge all these affairsand felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clearto him he made haste to finish buying the horses and often becameunreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermastera few days before his departure a special thanksgiving at whichnicholas was present was held in the cathedral for the russian victoryhe stood a little behind the governor and held himself with militarydecorum through the service meditating on a great variety of subjectswhen the service was over the governors wife beckoned him to herhave you seen the princess she asked indicating with a movement ofher head a lady standing on the opposite side beyond the choirnicholas immediately recognized princess mary not so much by the profilehe saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude timidity andpity that immediately overcame him princess mary evidently engrossedby her thoughts was crossing herself for the last time before leavingthe churchnicholas looked at her face with surprise it was the same face he hadseen before there was the same general expression of refined innerspiritual labor but now it was quite differently lit up there was apathetic expression of sorrow prayer and hope in it as had occurredbefore when she was present nicholas went up to her without waiting tobe prompted by the governors wife and not asking himself whether or notit was right and proper to address her here in church and told her hehad heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul as soon asshe heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face lighting up bothher sorrow and her joythere is one thing i wanted to tell you princess said rostov it isthat if your brother prince andrew nikolievich were not living itwould have been at once announced in the gazette as he is a colonelthe princess looked at him not grasping what he was saying but cheeredby the expression of regretful sympathy on his faceand i have known so many cases of a splinter wound the gazette saidit was a shell either proving fatal at once or being very slightcontinued nicholas we must hope for the best and i am sureprincess mary interrupted himoh that would be so dread she began and prevented by agitationfrom finishing she bent her head with a movement as graceful aseverything she did in his presence and looking up at him gratefullywent out following her auntthat evening nicholas did not go out but stayed at home to settle someaccounts with the horse dealers when he had finished that business itwas already too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bedand for a long time he paced up and down the room reflecting on hislife a thing he rarely didprincess mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had mether in smolensk province his having encountered her in such exceptionalcircumstances and his mother having at one time mentioned her to him asa good match had drawn his particular attention to her when he met heragain in voronezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasingbut powerful nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty heobserved in her at this time he was however preparing to go away andit had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himselfof chances of meeting her but that days encounter in church had hefelt sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind that palesad refined face that radiant look those gentle graceful gesturesand especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her featuresagitated him and evoked his sympathy in men rostov could not bear tosee the expression of a higher spiritual life that was why he did notlike prince andrew and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophyand dreaminess but in princess mary that very sorrow which revealed thedepth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistibleattractionshe must be a wonderful woman a real angel he said to himself whyam i not free why was i in such a hurry with sonya and heinvoluntarily compared the two the lack of spirituality in the one andthe abundance of it in the othera spirituality he himself lacked andtherefore valued most highly he tried to picture what would happen werehe free how he would propose to her and how she would become his wifebut no he could not imagine that he felt awed and no clear picturepresented itself to his mind he had long ago pictured to himself afuture with sonya and that was all clear and simple just because it hadall been thought out and he knew all there was in sonya but it wasimpossible to picture a future with princess mary because he did notunderstand her but simply loved herreveries about sonya had had something merry and playful in them but todream of princess mary was always difficult and a little frighteninghow she prayed he thought it was plain that her whole soul was inher prayer yes that was the prayer that moves mountains and i am sureher prayer will be answered why dont i pray for what i want hesuddenly thought what do i want to be free released from sonyashe was right he thought remembering what the governors wife hadsaid nothing but misfortune can come of marrying sonya muddles grieffor mamma business difficulties muddles terrible muddlesbesides i dont love hernot as i should o god release me from thisdreadful inextricable position he suddenly began to pray yesprayer can move mountains but one must have faith and not pray asnatasha and i used to as children that the snow might turn into sugarand then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so no but iam not praying for trifles now he thought as he put his pipe down in acorner and folding his hands placed himself before the icon softenedby memories of princess mary he began to pray as he had not done for along time tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the door openedand lavrushka came in with some papersblockhead why do you come in without being called cried nicholasquickly changing his attitudefrom the governor said lavrushka in a sleepy voice a courier hasarrived and theres a letter for youwell all right thanks you can gonicholas took the two letters one of which was from his mother and theother from sonya he recognized them by the handwriting and openedsonyas first he had read only a few lines when he turned pale and hiseyes opened wide with fear and joyno its not possible he cried aloudunable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter andreading it he glanced through it then read it again and then againand standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shouldersstretching out his hands with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixedwhat he had just been praying for with confidence that god would hearhim had come to pass but nicholas was as much astonished as if it weresomething extraordinary and unexpected and as if the very fact that ithad happened so quickly proved that it had not come from god to whom hehad prayed but by some ordinary coincidencethis unexpected and as it seemed to nicholas quite voluntary letterfrom sonya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from whichthere had seemed no escape she wrote that the last unfortunate eventsthe loss of almost the whole of the rostovs moscow propertyand thecountess repeatedly expressed wish that nicholas should marry princessbolkonskaya together with his silence and coldness of late had allcombined to make her decide to release him from his promise and set himcompletely freeit would be too painful to me to think that i might be a cause of sorrowor discord in the family that has been so good to me she wrote and mylove has no aim but the happiness of those i love so nicholas i begyou to consider yourself free and to be assured that in spite ofeverything no one can love you more than doesyour sonyaboth letters were written from troitsa the other from the countessdescribed their last days in moscow their departure the fire and thedestruction of all their property in this letter the countess alsomentioned that prince andrew was among the wounded traveling with themhis state was very critical but the doctor said there was now morehope sonya and natasha were nursing himnext day nicholas took his mothers letter and went to see princessmary neither he nor she said a word about what natasha nursing himmight mean but thanks to this letter nicholas suddenly became almost asintimate with the princess as if they were relationsthe following day he saw princess mary off on her journey to yaroslavland a few days later left to rejoin his regimentsonyas letter written from troitsa which had come as an answer tonicholas prayer was prompted by this the thought of getting nicholasmarried to an heiress occupied the old countess mind more and more sheknew that sonya was the chief obstacle to this happening and sonyaslife in the countess house had grown harder and harder especiallyafter they had received a letter from nicholas telling of his meetingwith princess mary in bogucharovo the countess let no occasion slip ofmaking humiliating or cruel allusions to sonyabut a few days before they left moscow moved and excited by all thatwas going on she called sonya to her and instead of reproaching andmaking demands on her tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself andrepay all that the family had done for her by breaking off herengagement with nicholasi shall not be at peace till you promise me thissonya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that shewould do anything and was prepared for anything but gave no actualpromise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded ofher she must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared andbrought her up to sacrifice herself for others was sonyas habit herposition in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show herworth and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it but in all herformer acts of selfsacrifice she had been happily conscious that theyraised her in her own esteem and in that of others and so made her moreworthy of nicholas whom she loved more than anything in the world butnow they wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted thewhole reward for her selfsacrifice and the whole meaning of her lifeand for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had beenher benefactors only to torture her the more painfully she felt jealousof natasha who had never experienced anything of this sort had neverneeded to sacrifice herself but made others sacrifice themselves forher and yet was beloved by everybody and for the first time sonya feltthat out of her pure quiet love for nicholas a passionate feeling wasbeginning to grow up which was stronger than principle virtue orreligion under the influence of this feeling sonya whose life ofdependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive having answeredthe countess in vague general terms avoided talking with her andresolved to wait till she should see nicholas not in order to set himfree but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her foreverthe bustle and terror of the rostovs last days in moscow stifled thegloomy thoughts that oppressed sonya she was glad to find escape fromthem in practical activity but when she heard of prince andrewspresence in their house despite her sincere pity for him and fornatasha she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that goddid not intend her to be separated from nicholas she knew that natashaloved no one but prince andrew and had never ceased to love him sheknew that being thrown together again under such terrible circumstancesthey would again fall in love with one another and that nicholas wouldthen not be able to marry princess mary as they would be within theprohibited degrees of affinity despite all the terror of what hadhappened during those last days and during the first days of theirjourney this feeling that providence was intervening in her personalaffairs cheered sonyaat the troitsa monastery the rostovs first broke their journey for awhole daythree large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry oneof which was occupied by prince andrew the wounded man was much betterthat day and natasha was sitting with him in the next room sat thecount and countess respectfully conversing with the prior who wascalling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monasterysonya was there too tormented by curiosity as to what prince andrew andnatasha were talking about she heard the sound of their voices throughthe door that door opened and natasha came out looking excited notnoticing the monk who had risen to greet her and was drawing back thewide sleeve on his right arm she went up to sonya and took her handnatasha what are you about come here said the countessnatasha went up to the monk for his blessing and he advised her to prayfor aid to god and his saintas soon as the prior withdrew natasha took her friend by the hand andwent with her into the unoccupied roomsonya will he live she asked sonya how happy i am and howunhappy sonya dovey everything is as it used to be if only helives he cannot because because of and natasha burst intotearsyes i knew it thank god murmured sonya he will livesonya was not less agitated than her friend by the latters fear andgrief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no onesobbing she kissed and comforted natasha if only he lives shethought having wept talked and wiped away their tears the twofriends went together to prince andrews door natasha opened itcautiously and glanced into the room sonya standing beside her at thehalfopen doorprince andrew was lying raised high on three pillows his pale face wascalm his eyes closed and they could see his regular breathingo natasha sonya suddenly almost screamed catching her companionsarm and stepping back from the doorwhat what is it asked natashaits that that said sonya with a white face and trembling lipsnatasha softly closed the door and went with sonya to the window notyet understanding what the latter was telling heryou remember said sonya with a solemn and frightened expression youremember when i looked in the mirror for you at otradnoe atchristmas do you remember what i sawyes yes cried natasha opening her eyes wide and vaguely recallingthat sonya had told her something about prince andrew whom she had seenlying downyou remember sonya went on i saw it then and told everybody youand dunyasha i saw him lying on a bed said she making a gesture withher hand and a lifted finger at each detail and that he had his eyesclosed and was covered just with a pink quilt and that his hands werefolded she concluded convincing herself that the details she had justseen were exactly what she had seen in the mirrorshe had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing thatcame into her head but what she had invented then seemed to her now asreal as any other recollection she not only remembered what she hadthen saidthat he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered withsomething redbut was firmly convinced that she had then seen and saidthat he was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closedyes yes it really was pink cried natasha who now thought she tooremembered the word pink being used and saw in this the mostextraordinary and mysterious part of the predictionbut what does it mean she added meditativelyoh i dont know it is all so strange replied sonya clutching ather heada few minutes later prince andrew rang and natasha went to him butsonya feeling unusually excited and touched remained at the windowthinking about the strangeness of what had occurredthey had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army and thecountess was writing to her sonsonya said the countess raising her eyes from her letter as herniece passed sonya wont you write to nicholas she spoke in a softtremulous voice and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectaclessonya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words thoseeyes expressed entreaty shame at having to ask fear of a refusal andreadiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusalsonya went up to the countess and kneeling down kissed her handyes mamma i will write said shesonya was softened excited and touched by all that had occurred thatday especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of hervision now that she knew that the renewal of natashas relations withprince andrew would prevent nicholas from marrying princess mary shewas joyfully conscious of a return of that selfsacrificing spirit inwhich she was accustomed to live and loved to live so with a joyfulconsciousness of performing a magnanimous deedinterrupted severaltimes by the tears that dimmed her velvety black eyesshe wrote thattouching letter the arrival of which had so amazed nicholasthe officer and soldiers who had arrested pierre treated him withhostility but yet with respect in the guardhouse to which he was takenin their attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as towho he might beperhaps a very important personand hostility as aresult of their recent personal conflict with himbut when the guard was relieved next morning pierre felt that for thenew guardboth officers and menhe was not as interesting as he hadbeen to his captors and in fact the guard of the second day did notrecognize in this big stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous personwho had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and haduttered those solemn words about saving a child they saw in him onlyno  of the captured russians arrested and detained for some reasonby order of the higher command if they noticed anything remarkableabout pierre it was only his unabashed meditative concentration andthoughtfulness and the way he spoke french which struck them assurprisingly good in spite of this he was placed that day with theother arrested suspects as the separate room he had occupied wasrequired by an officerall the russians confined with pierre were men of the lowest class andrecognizing him as a gentleman they all avoided him more especially ashe spoke french pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of himthat evening he learned that all these prisoners he probably amongthem were to be tried for incendiarism on the third day he was takenwith the others to a house where a french general with a white mustachesat with two colonels and other frenchmen with scarves on their armswith the precision and definiteness customary in addressing prisonersand which is supposed to preclude human frailty pierre like the otherswas questioned as to who he was where he had been with what objectand so onthese questions like questions put at trials generally left theessence of the matter aside shut out the possibility of that essencesbeing revealed and were designed only to form a channel through whichthe judges wished the answers of the accused to flow so as to lead tothe desired result namely a conviction as soon as pierre began to sayanything that did not fit in with that aim the channel was removed andthe water could flow to waste pierre felt moreover what the accusedalways feel at their trial perplexity as to why these questions wereput to him he had a feeling that it was only out of condescension or akind of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed heknew he was in these mens power that only by force had they broughthim there that force alone gave them the right to demand answers totheir questions and that the sole object of that assembly was toinculpate him and so as they had the power and wish to inculpate himthis expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary it wasevident that any answer would lead to conviction when asked what he wasdoing when he was arrested pierre replied in a rather tragic mannerthat he was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from theflames why had he fought the marauder pierre answered that he wasprotecting a woman and that to protect a woman who was being insultedwas the duty of every man that they interrupted him for this wasnot to the point why was he in the yard of a burning house wherewitnesses had seen him he replied that he had gone out to see what washappening in moscow again they interrupted him they had not askedwhere he was going but why he was found near the fire who was he theyasked repeating their first question which he had declined to answeragain he replied that he could not answer itput that down thats bad very bad sternly remarked the generalwith the white mustache and red flushed faceon the fourth day fires broke out on the zubovski rampartpierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a merchantshouse near the crimean bridge on his way through the streets pierrefelt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the whole cityfires were visible on all sides he did not then realize thesignificance of the burning of moscow and looked at the fires withhorrorhe passed four days in the coach house near the crimean bridge andduring that time learned from the talk of the french soldiers that allthose confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any dayfrom the marshal what marshal this was pierre could not learn from thesoldiers evidently for them the marshal represented a very high andrather mysterious powerthese first days before the eighth of september when the prisoners werehad up for a second examination were the hardest of all for pierreon the eighth of september an officera very important one judging bythe respect the guards showed himentered the coach house where theprisoners were this officer probably someone on the staff was holdinga paper in his hand and called over all the russians there namingpierre as the man who does not give his name glancing indolently andindifferently at all the prisoners he ordered the officer in charge tohave them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to themarshal an hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and pierre withthirteen others was led to the virgins field it was a fine day sunnyafter rain and the air was unusually pure the smoke did not hang lowas on the day when pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on thezubovski rampart but rose through the pure air in columns no flameswere seen but columns of smoke rose on all sides and all moscow as faras pierre could see was one vast charred ruin on all sides there werewaste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing andhere and there the blackened walls of some brick houses pierre gazed atthe ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well here andthere he could see churches that had not been burned the kremlin whichwas not destroyed gleamed white in the distance with its towers and thebelfry of ivan the great the domes of the new convent of the virginglittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearlythese bells reminded pierre that it was sunday and the feast of thenativity of the virgin but there seemed to be no one to celebrate thisholiday everywhere were blackened ruins and the few russians to beseen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they sawthe frenchit was plain that the russian nest was ruined and destroyed but inplace of the russian order of life that had been destroyed pierreunconsciously felt that a quite different firm french order had beenestablished over this ruined nest he felt this in the looks of thesoldiers who marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily wereescorting him and the other criminals he felt it in the looks of animportant french official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldierwhom they met on the way he felt it in the merry sounds of regimentalmusic he heard from the left side of the field and felt and realized itespecially from the list of prisoners the french officer had read outwhen he came that morning pierre had been taken by one set of soldiersand led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other menand it seemed that they might have forgotten him or confused him withthe others but no the answers he had given when questioned had comeback to him in his designation as the man who does not give his nameand under that appellation which to pierre seemed terrible they werenow leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their facesthat he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wantedand that they were being taken to the proper place pierre felt himselfto be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whoseaction he did not understand but which was working wellhe and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the virginsfield to a large white house with an immense garden not far from theconvent this was prince shcherbitovs house where pierre had oftenbeen in other days and which as he learned from the talk of thesoldiers was now occupied by the marshal the duke of eckmuhl davoutthey were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by onepierre was the sixth to enter he was conducted through a glass galleryan anteroom and a hall which were familiar to him into a long lowstudy at the door of which stood an adjutantdavout spectacles on nose sat bent over a table at the further end ofthe room pierre went close up to him but davout evidently consultinga paper that lay before him did not look up without raising his eyeshe said in a low voicewho are youpierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word to himdavout was not merely a french general but a man notorious for hiscruelty looking at his cold face as he sat like a stern schoolmasterwho was prepared to wait awhile for an answer pierre felt that everyinstant of delay might cost him his life but he did not know what tosay he did not venture to repeat what he had said at his firstexamination yet to disclose his rank and position was dangerous andembarrassing so he was silent but before he had decided what to dodavout raised his head pushed his spectacles back on his foreheadscrewed up his eyes and looked intently at himi know that man he said in a cold measured tone evidentlycalculated to frighten pierrethe chill that had been running down pierres back now seized his headas in a viseyou cannot know me general i have never seen youhe is a russian spy davout interrupted addressing another generalwho was present but whom pierre had not noticeddavout turned away with an unexpected reverberation in his voice pierrerapidly beganno monseigneur he said suddenly remembering that davout was a dukeno monseigneur you cannot have known me i am a militia officer andhave not quitted moscowyour name asked davoutbezukhovwhat proof have i that you are not lyingmonseigneur exclaimed pierre not in an offended but in a pleadingvoicedavout looked up and gazed intently at him for some seconds they lookedat one another and that look saved pierre apart from conditions of warand law that look established human relations between the two men atthat moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both theirminds and they realized that they were both children of humanity andwere brothersat the first glance when davout had only raised his head from thepapers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers pierrewas merely a circumstance and davout could have shot him withoutburdening his conscience with an evil deed but now he saw in him ahuman being he reflected for a momenthow can you show me that you are telling the truth said davoutcoldlypierre remembered ramballe and named him and his regiment and thestreet where the house wasyou are not what you say returned davoutin a trembling faltering voice pierre began adducing proofs of thetruth of his statementsbut at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to davoutdavout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought and beganbuttoning up his uniform it seemed that he had quite forgotten pierrewhen the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner he jerked his head inpierres direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away butwhere they were to take him pierre did not know back to the coach houseor to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to him asthey crossed the virgins fieldhe turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting anotherquestion to davoutyes of course replied davout but what this yes meant pierre didnot knowpierre could not afterwards remember how he went whether it was far orin which direction his faculties were quite numbed he was stupefiedand noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the othersdid till they all stopped and he stopped too the only thought in hismind at that time was who was it that had really sentenced him todeath not the men on the commission that had first examined himnotone of them wished to or evidently could have done it it was notdavout who had looked at him in so human a way in another momentdavout would have realized that he was doing wrong but just then theadjutant had come in and interrupted him the adjutant also hadevidently had no evil intent though he might have refrained from comingin then who was executing him killing him depriving him of lifehimpierre with all his memories aspirations hopes and thoughts who wasdoing this and pierre felt that it was no oneit was a systema concurrence of circumstancesa system of some sort was killing himpierredepriving him of life ofeverything annihilating himfrom prince shcherbatovs house the prisoners were led straight down thevirgins field to the left of the nunnery as far as a kitchen gardenin which a post had been set up beyond that post a fresh pit had beendug in the ground and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood ina semicircle the crowd consisted of a few russians and many ofnapoleons soldiers who were not on dutygermans italians andfrenchmen in a variety of uniforms to the right and left of the poststood rows of french troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and highboots and shakosthe prisoners were placed in a certain order according to the listpierre was sixth and were led to the post several drums suddenlybegan to beat on both sides of them and at that sound pierre felt as ifpart of his soul had been torn away he lost the power of thinking orunderstanding he could only hear and see and he had only one wishthat the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quicklypierre looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized themthe two first were convicts with shaven heads one was tall and thinthe other dark shaggy and sinewy with a flat nose the third was adomestic serf about fortyfive years old with grizzled hair and aplump wellnourished body the fourth was a peasant a very handsomeman with a broad lightbrown beard and black eyes the fifth was afactory hand a thin sallowfaced lad of eighteen in a loose coatpierre heard the french consulting whether to shoot them separately ortwo at a time in couples replied the officer in command in a calmvoice there was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evidentthat they were all hurryingnot as men hurry to do something theyunderstand but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant andincomprehensible taska french official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row ofprisoners and read out the sentence in russian and in frenchthen two pairs of frenchmen approached the criminals and at theofficers command took the two convicts who stood first in the row theconvicts stopped when they reached the post and while sacks were beingbrought looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approachinghuntsman one crossed himself continually the other scratched his backand made a movement of the lips resembling a smile with hurried handsthe soldiers blindfolded them drawing the sacks over their heads andbound them to the posttwelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firmregular tread and halted eight paces from the post pierre turned awayto avoid seeing what was going to happen suddenly a crackling rollingnoise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most terrificthunder and he looked round there was some smoke and the frenchmenwere doing something near the pit with pale faces and trembling handstwo more prisoners were led up in the same way and with similar looksthese two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal forprotection in their eyes evidently unable to understand or believe whatwas going to happen to them they could not believe it because theyalone knew what their life meant to them and so they neither understoodnor believed that it could be taken from themagain pierre did not wish to look and again turned away but again thesound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear and at the same momenthe saw smoke blood and the pale scared faces of the frenchmen whowere again doing something by the post their trembling hands impedingone another pierre breathing heavily looked around as if asking whatit meant the same question was expressed in all the looks that met hison the faces of all the russians and of the french soldiers and officerswithout exception he read the same dismay horror and conflict thatwere in his own heart but who after all is doing this they are allsuffering as i am who then is it who flashed for an instant throughhis mindsharpshooters of the th forward shouted someone the fifthprisoner the one next to pierre was led awayalone pierre did notunderstand that he was saved that he and the rest had been broughtthere only to witness the execution with evergrowing horror and nosense of joy or relief he gazed at what was taking place the fifth manwas the factory lad in the loose cloak the moment they laid hands onhim he sprang aside in terror and clutched at pierre pierre shudderedand shook himself free the lad was unable to walk they dragged himalong holding him up under the arms and he screamed when they got himto the post he grew quiet as if he suddenly understood somethingwhether he understood that screaming was useless or whether he thoughtit incredible that men should kill him at any rate he took his stand atthe post waiting to be blindfolded like the others and like a woundedanimal looked around him with glittering eyespierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes his curiosityand agitation like that of the whole crowd reached the highest pitchat this fifth murder like the others this fifth man seemed calm hewrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the otherwhen they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot which hurtthe back of his head then when they propped him against thebloodstained post he leaned back and not being comfortable in thatposition straightened himself adjusted his feet and leaned back againmore comfortably pierre did not take his eyes from him and did not misshis slightest movementprobably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports ofeight muskets but try as he would pierre could not afterwards rememberhaving heard the slightest sound of the shots he only saw how theworkman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him how blood showeditself in two places how the ropes slackened under the weight of thehanging body and how the workman sat down his head hanging unnaturallyand one leg bent under him pierre ran up to the post no one hinderedhim pale frightened people were doing something around the workmanthe lower jaw of an old frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as heuntied the ropes the body collapsed the soldiers dragged it awkwardlyfrom the post and began pushing it into the pitthey all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who musthide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possiblepierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying withhis knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the otherthat shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively but spadefulsof earth were already being thrown over the whole body one of thesoldiers evidently suffering shouted gruffly and angrily at pierre togo back but pierre did not understand him and remained near the postand no one drove him awaywhen the pit had been filled up a command was given pierre was takenback to his place and the rows of troops on both sides of the post madea half turn and went past it at a measured pace the twentyfoursharpshooters with discharged muskets standing in the center of thecircle ran back to their places as the companies passed bypierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran incouples out of the circle all but one rejoined their companies thisone a young soldier his face deadly pale his shako pushed back andhis musket resting on the ground still stood near the pit at the spotfrom which he had fired he swayed like a drunken man taking some stepsforward and back to save himself from falling an old noncommissionedofficer ran out of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him tohis company the crowd of russians and frenchmen began to disperse theyall went away silently and with drooping headsthat will teach them to start fires said one of the frenchmenpierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier whowas trying to find some relief after what had been done but was notable to do so without finishing what he had begun to say he made ahopeless movement with his arm and went awayafter the execution pierre was separated from the rest of the prisonersand placed alone in a small ruined and befouled churchtoward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers andtold him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks forthe prisoners of war without understanding what was said to him pierregot up and went with the soldiers they took him to the upper end of thefield where there were some sheds built of charred planks beams andbattens and led him into one of them in the darkness some twentydifferent men surrounded pierre he looked at them without understandingwho they were why they were there or what they wanted of him he heardwhat they said but did not understand the meaning of the words and madeno kind of deduction from or application of them he replied toquestions they put to him but did not consider who was listening to hisreplies nor how they would understand them he looked at their facesand figures but they all seemed to him equally meaninglessfrom the moment pierre had witnessed those terrible murders committed bymen who did not wish to commit them it was as if the mainspring of hislife on which everything depended and which made everything appearalive had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had collapsed intoa heap of meaningless rubbish though he did not acknowledge it tohimself his faith in the right ordering of the universe in humanityin his own soul and in god had been destroyed he had experienced thisbefore but never so strongly as now when similar doubts had assailedhim before they had been the result of his own wrongdoing and at thebottom of his heart he had felt that relief from his despair and fromthose doubts was to be found within himself but now he felt that theuniverse had crumbled before his eyes and only meaningless ruinsremained and this not by any fault of his own he felt that it was notin his power to regain faith in the meaning of lifearound him in the darkness men were standing and evidently somethingabout him interested them greatly they were telling him something andasking him something then they led him away somewhere and at last hefound himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing andtalking on all sideswell then mates that very prince who some voice at the otherend of the shed was saying with a strong emphasis on the word whositting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wallpierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes but as soon as heclosed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory ladespecially dreadful because of its simplicityand the faces of themurderers even more dreadful because of their disquiet and he openedhis eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around himbeside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose presence hewas first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration which came fromhim every time he moved this man was doing something to his legs in thedarkness and though pierre could not see his face he felt that the mancontinually glanced at him on growing used to the darkness pierre sawthat the man was taking off his leg bands and the way he did it arousedpierres interesthaving unwound the string that tied the band on one leg he carefullycoiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg glancing upat pierre while one hand hung up the first string the other was alreadyunwinding the band on the second leg in this way having carefullyremoved the leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following oneanother uninterruptedly the man hung the leg bands up on some pegsfixed above his head then he took out a knife cut something closedthe knife placed it under the head of his bed and seating himselfcomfortably clasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyeson pierre the latter was conscious of something pleasant comfortingand wellrounded in these deft movements in the mans wellorderedarrangements in his corner and even in his very smell and he looked atthe man without taking his eyes from himyouve seen a lot of trouble sir eh the little man suddenly saidand there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong voicethat pierre tried to reply but his jaw trembled and he felt tearsrising to his eyes the little fellow giving pierre no time to betrayhis confusion instantly continued in the same pleasant toneseh lad dont fret said he in the tender singsong caressing voiceold russian peasant women employ dont fret friendsuffer an hourlive for an age thats how it is my dear fellow and here we livethank heaven without offense among these folk too there are good menas well as bad said he and still speaking he turned on his kneeswith a supple movement got up coughed and went off to another part ofthe shedeh you rascal pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the otherend of the shed so youve come you rascal she remembers now nowthatll doand the soldier pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at himreturned to his place and sat down in his hands he had somethingwrapped in a raghere eat a bit sir said he resuming his former respectful tone ashe unwrapped and offered pierre some baked potatoes we had soup fordinner and the potatoes are grandpierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemedextremely pleasant to him he thanked the soldier and began to eatwell are they all right said the soldier with a smile you shoulddo like thishe took a potato drew out his clasp knife cut the potato into twoequal halves on the palm of his hand sprinkled some salt on it from therag and handed it to pierrethe potatoes are grand he said once more eat some like thatpierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted betteroh im all right said he but why did they shoot those poorfellows the last one was hardly twentytss tt said the little man ah what a sin what a sin headded quickly and as if his words were always waiting ready in hismouth and flew out involuntarily he went on how was it sir that youstayed in moscowi didnt think they would come so soon i stayed accidentally repliedpierreand how did they arrest you dear lad at your houseno i went to look at the fire and they arrested me there and triedme as an incendiarywhere

pierre inquiredhow can one help it lad my name is platon and the surname iskarataev he added evidently wishing to make it easier for pierre toaddress him they call me little falcon in the regiment how is oneto help feeling sad moscowshes the mother of cities how can one seeall this and not feel sad but the maggot gnaws the cabbage yet diesfirst thats what the old folks used to tell us he added rapidlywhat what did you say asked pierrewho i said karataev i say things happen not as we plan but as godjudges he replied thinking that he was repeating what he had saidbefore and immediately continuedwell and you have you a family estate sir and a house so you haveabundance then and a housewife and your old parents are they stillliving he askedand though it was too dark for pierre to see he felt that a suppressedsmile of kindliness puckered the soldiers lips as he put thesequestions he seemed grieved that pierre had no parents especially thathe had no mothera wife for counsel a motherinlaw for welcome but theres none asdear as ones own mother said he well and have you little ones hewent on askingagain pierres negative answer seemed to distress him and he hastenedto addnever mind youre young folks yet and please god may still have somethe great thing is to live in harmonybut its all the same now pierre could not help sayingah my dear fellow rejoined karataev never decline a prison or abeggars sackhe seated himself more comfortably and coughed evidently preparing totell a long storywell my dear fellow i was still living at home he began we had awelltodo homestead plenty of land we peasants lived well and ourhouse was one to thank god for when father and we went out mowing therewere seven of us we lived well we were real peasants it sohappenedand platon karataev told a long story of how he had gone into someonescopse to take wood how he had been caught by the keeper had beentried flogged and sent to serve as a soldierwell lad and a smile changed the tone of his voice we thought itwas a misfortune but it turned out a blessing if it had not been for mysin my brother would have had to go as a soldier but he my youngerbrother had five little ones while i you see

you youngwoman you bow down too and you grandchildren also bow down beforehim do you understand he says thats how it is dear fellow fatelooks for a head but we are always judging thats not wellthatsnot right our luck is like water in a dragnet you pull at it and itbulges but when youve drawn it out its empty thats how it isand platon shifted his seat on the strawafter a short silence he rosewell i think you must be sleepy said he and began rapidly crossinghimself and repeatinglord jesus christ holy saint nicholas frola and lavra lord jesuschrist holy saint nicholas frola and lavra lord jesus christ havemercy on us and save us he concluded then bowed to the ground gotup sighed and sat down again on his heap of straw thats the waylay me down like a stone o god and raise me up like a loaf hemuttered as he lay down pulling his coat over himwhat prayer was that you were saying asked pierreeh murmured platon who had almost fallen asleep what was i sayingi was praying dont you prayyes i do said pierre but what was that you said frola and lavrawell of course replied platon quickly the horses saints one mustpity the animals too eh the rascal now youve curled up and got warmyou daughter of a bitch said karataev touching the dog that lay athis feet and again turning over he fell asleep immediatelysounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distanceoutside and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed butinside it was quiet and dark for a long time pierre did not sleep butlay with eyes open in the darkness listening to the regular snoring ofplaton who lay beside him and he felt that the world that had beenshattered was once more stirring in his soul with a new beauty and onnew and unshakable foundationstwentythree soldiers three officers and two officials were confinedin the shed in which pierre had been placed and where he remained forfour weekswhen pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures tohim except platon karataev who always remained in his mind a most vividand precious memory and the personification of everything russiankindly and round when pierre saw his neighbor next morning at dawn thefirst impression of him as of something round was fully confirmedplatons whole figurein a french overcoat girdled with a cord asoldiers cap and bast shoeswas round his head was quite round hisback chest shoulders and even his arms which he held as if everready to embrace something were rounded his pleasant smile and hislarge gentle brown eyes were also roundplaton karataev must have been fifty judging by his stories ofcampaigns he had been in told as by an old soldier he did not himselfknow his age and was quite unable to determine it but his brilliantlywhite strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when helaughedas he often didwere all sound and good there was not a grayhair in his beard or on his head and his whole body gave an impressionof suppleness and especially of firmness and endurancehis face despite its fine rounded wrinkles had an expression ofinnocence and youth his voice was pleasant and musical but the chiefpeculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness it wasevident that he never considered what he had said or was going to sayand consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had anirresistible persuasivenesshis physical strength and agility during the first days of hisimprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue andsickness meant every night before lying down he said lord lay medown as a stone and raise me up as a loaf and every morning on gettingup he said i lay down and curled up i get up and shake myself andindeed he only had to lie down to fall asleep like a stone and he onlyhad to shake himself to be ready without a moments delay for somework just as children are ready to play directly they awake he coulddo everything not very well but not badly he baked cooked sewedplaned and mended boots he was always busy and only at night allowedhimself conversationof which he was fondand songs he did not singlike a trained singer who knows he is listened to but like the birdsevidently giving vent to the sounds in the same way that one stretchesoneself or walks about to get rid of stiffness and the sounds werealways highpitched mournful delicate and almost feminine and hisface at such times was very serioushaving been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow he seemed tohave thrown off all that had been forced upon himeverything militaryand alien to himselfand had returned to his former peasant habitsa soldier on leavea shirt outside breeches he would sayhe did not like talking about his life as a soldier though he did notcomplain and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once duringthe whole of his army service when he related anything it was generallysome old and evidently precious memory of his christian life as hecalled his peasant existence the proverbs of which his talk was fullwere for the most part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers employbut those folk sayings which taken without a context seem soinsignificant but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significanceof profound wisdomhe would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a previousoccasion yet both would be right he liked to talk and he talked welladorning his speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings whichpierre thought he invented himself but the chief charm of his talk layin the fact that the commonest eventssometimes just such as pierre hadwitnessed without taking notice of themassumed in karataevs acharacter of solemn fitness he liked to hear the folk tales one of thesoldiers used to tell of an evening they were always the same butmost of all he liked to hear stories of real life he would smilejoyfully when listening to such stories now and then putting in a wordor asking a question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clearto himself karataev had no attachments friendships or love as pierreunderstood them but loved and lived affectionately with everything lifebrought him in contact with particularly with mannot any particularman but those with whom he happened to be he loved his dog hiscomrades the french and pierre who was his neighbor but pierre feltthat in spite of karataevs affectionate tenderness for him by which heunconsciously gave pierres spiritual life its due he would not havegrieved for a moment at parting from him and pierre began to feel inthe same way toward karataevto all the other prisoners platon karataev seemed a most ordinarysoldier they called him little falcon or platosha chaffed himgoodnaturedly and sent him on errands but to pierre he alwaysremained what he had seemed that first night an unfathomable roundedeternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and truthplaton karataev knew nothing by heart except his prayers when he beganto speak he seemed not to know how he would concludesometimes pierre struck by the meaning of his words would ask him torepeat them but platon could never recall what he had said a momentbefore just as he never could repeat to pierre the words of hisfavorite song native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred init but when spoken and not sung no meaning could be got out of it hedid not and could not understand the meaning of words apart from theircontext every word and action of his was the manifestation of anactivity unknown to him which was his life but his life as heregarded it had no meaning as a separate thing it had meaning only aspart of a whole of which he was always conscious his words and actionsflowed from him as evenly inevitably and spontaneously as fragranceexhales from a flower he could not understand the value or significanceof any word or deed taken separatelywhen princess mary heard from nicholas that her brother was with therostovs at yaroslavl she at once prepared to go there in spite of heraunts efforts to dissuade herand not merely to go herself but to takeher nephew with her whether it were difficult or easy possible orimpossible she did not ask and did not want to know it was her dutynot only to herself to be near her brother who was perhaps dying butto do everything possible to take his son to him and so she prepared toset off that she had not heard from prince andrew himself princessmary attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering thelong journey too hard and too dangerous for her and his sonin a few days princess mary was ready to start her equipages were thehuge family coach in which she had traveled to voronezh a semiopentrap and a baggage cart with her traveled mademoiselle bouriennelittle nicholas and his tutor her old nurse three maids tikhon and ayoung footman and courier her aunt had sent to accompany herthe usual route through moscow could not be thought of and theroundabout way princess mary was obliged to take through lipetskryazan vladimir and shuya was very long and as post horses were noteverywhere obtainable very difficult and near ryazan where the frenchwere said to have shown themselves was even dangerousduring this difficult journey mademoiselle bourienne dessalles andprincess marys servants were astonished at her energy and firmness ofspirit she went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them and nodifficulties daunted her thanks to her activity and energy whichinfected her fellow travelers they approached yaroslavl by the end ofthe second weekthe last days of her stay in voronezh had been the happiest of her lifeher love for rostov no longer tormented or agitated her it filled herwhole soul had become an integral part of herself and she no longerstruggled against it latterly she had become convinced that she lovedand was beloved though she never said this definitely to herself inwords she had become convinced of it at her last interview withnicholas when he had come to tell her that her brother was with therostovs not by a single word had nicholas alluded to the fact thatprince andrews relations with natasha might if he recovered berenewed but princess mary saw by his face that he knew and thought ofthisyet in spite of that his relation to herconsiderate delicate andlovingnot only remained unchanged but it sometimes seemed to princessmary that he was even glad that the family connection between themallowed him to express his friendship more freely she knew that sheloved for the first and only time in her life and felt that she wasbeloved and was happy in regard to itbut this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not preventher feeling grief for her brother with full force on the contrary thatspiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for herto give full play to her feeling for her brother that feeling was sostrong at the moment of leaving voronezh that those who saw her off asthey looked at her careworn despairing face felt sure she would fallill on the journey but the very difficulties and preoccupations of thejourney which she took so actively in hand saved her for a while fromher grief and gave her strengthas always happens when traveling princess mary thought only of thejourney itself forgetting its object but as she approached yaroslavlthe thought of what might await her therenot after many days but thatvery eveningagain presented itself to her and her agitation increasedto its utmost limitthe courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where therostovs were staying in yaroslavl and in what condition prince andrewwas when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalledby the terrible pallor of the princess face that looked out at him fromthe windowi have found out everything your excellency the rostovs are stayingat the merchant bronnikovs house in the square not far from hereright above the volga said the courierprincess mary looked at him with frightened inquiry not understandingwhy he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know how was herbrother mademoiselle bourienne put that question for herhow is the prince she askedhis excellency is staying in the same house with themthen he is alive thought princess mary and asked in a low voicehow is hethe servants say he is still the samewhat still the same might mean princess mary did not ask but with anunnoticed glance at little sevenyearold nicholas who was sitting infront of her looking with pleasure at the town she bowed her head anddid not raise it again till the heavy coach rumbling shaking andswaying came to a stop the carriage steps clattered as they were letdownthe carriage door was opened on the left there was watera greatriverand on the right a porch there were people at the entranceservants and a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair smiling asit seemed to princess mary in an unpleasantly affected way this wassonya princess mary ran up the steps this way this way said thegirl with the same artificial smile and the princess found herself inthe hall facing an elderly woman of oriental type who came rapidly tomeet her with a look of emotion this was the countess she embracedprincess mary and kissed hermon enfant she muttered je vous aime et vous connais depuislongtemps  my child i love you and have known you a long timedespite her excitement princess mary realized that this was thecountess and that it was necessary to say something to her hardlyknowing how she did it she contrived to utter a few polite phrases infrench in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her andasked how is hethe doctor says that he is not in danger said the countess but asshe spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh and her gesture conveyed acontradiction of her wordswhere is he can i see himcan i asked the princessone moment princess one moment my dear is this his son said thecountess turning to little nicholas who was coming in with dessallesthere will be room for everybody this is a big house oh what alovely boythe countess took princess mary into the drawing room where sonya wastalking to mademoiselle bourienne the countess caressed the boy andthe old count came in and welcomed the princess he had changed verymuch since princess mary had last seen him then he had been a briskcheerful selfassured old man now he seemed a pitiful bewilderedperson while talking to princess mary he continually looked round as ifasking everyone whether he was doing the right thing after thedestruction of moscow and of his property thrown out of his accustomedgroove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own significance and tofeel that there was no longer a place for him in lifein spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible andher vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him theyshould be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephewthe princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt thenecessity of submitting for a time to this new order of things whichshe had entered she knew it to be necessary and though it was hard forher she was not vexed with these peoplethis is my niece said the count introducing sonyayou dont knowher princessprincess mary turned to sonya and trying to stifle the hostile feelingthat arose in her toward the girl she kissed her but she feltoppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so farfrom what was in her own heartwhere is he she asked again addressing them allhe is downstairs natasha is with him answered sonya flushing wehave sent to ask i think you must be tired princesstears of vexation showed themselves in princess marys eyes she turnedaway and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him whenlight impetuous and seemingly buoyant steps were heard at the doorthe princess looked round and saw natasha coming in almost runningthat natasha whom she had liked so little at their meeting in moscowlong sincebut hardly had the princess looked at natashas face before she realizedthat here was a real comrade in her grief and consequently a friendshe ran to meet her embraced her and began to cry on her shoulderas soon as natasha sitting at the head of prince andrews bed heard ofprincess marys arrival she softly left his room and hastened to herwith those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to princess marythere was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into thedrawing roomthat of loveboundless love for him for her and for allthat was near to the man she loved and of pity suffering for othersand passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them it wasplain that at that moment there was in natashas heart no thought ofherself or of her own relations with prince andrewprincess mary with her acute sensibility understood all this at thefirst glance at natashas face and wept on her shoulder with sorrowfulpleasurecome come to him mary said natasha leading her into the otherroomprincess mary raised her head dried her eyes and turned to natashashe felt that from her she would be able to understand and learneverythinghow she began her question but stopped shortshe felt that it was impossible to ask or to answer in wordsnatashas face and eyes would have to tell her all more clearly andprofoundlynatasha was gazing at her but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to sayall she knew or not she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyeswhich penetrated into the very depths of her heart it was impossiblenot to tell the whole truth which she saw and suddenly natashas lipstwitched ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth and covering her facewith her hands she burst into sobsprincess mary understoodbut she still hoped and asked in words she herself did not trustbut how is his wound what is his general conditionyou you will see was all natasha could saythey sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had left offcrying and were able to go to him with calm faceshow has his whole illness gone is it long since he grew worse whendid this happen princess mary inquirednatasha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverishcondition and the pain he suffered but at troitsa that had passed andthe doctor had only been afraid of gangrene that danger had alsopassed when they reached yaroslavl the wound had begun to festernatasha knew all about such things as festering and the doctor hadsaid that the festering might take a normal course then fever set inbut the doctor had said the fever was not very seriousbut two days ago this suddenly happened said natasha struggling withher sobs i dont know why but you will see what he is likeis he weaker thinner asked the princessno its not that but worse you will see o mary he is too good hecannot cannot live becausewhen natasha opened prince andrews door with a familiar movement andlet princess mary pass into the room before her the princess felt thesobs in her throat hard as she had tried to prepare herself and nowtried to remain tranquil she knew that she would be unable to look athim without tearsthe princess understood what natasha had meant by the words two daysago this suddenly happened she understood those words to mean that hehad suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signsof approaching death as she stepped to the door she already saw inimagination andrews face as she remembered it in childhood a gentlemild sympathetic face which he had rarely shown and which thereforeaffected her very strongly she was sure he would speak soft tenderwords to her such as her father had uttered before his death and thatshe would not be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in hispresence yet sooner or later it had to be and she went in the sobsrose higher and higher in her throat as she more and more clearlydistinguished his form and her shortsighted eyes tried to make out hisfeatures and then she saw his face and met his gazehe was lying in a squirrelfur dressing gown on a divan surrounded bypillows he was thin and pale in one thin translucently white hand heheld a handkerchief while with the other he stroked the delicatemustache he had grown moving his fingers slowly his eyes gazed at themas they enteredon seeing his face and meeting his eyes princess marys pace suddenlyslackened she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased she suddenlyfelt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of his face andeyesbut in what am i to blame she asked herself and his cold stern lookreplied because you are alive and thinking of the living while iin the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there wasan almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his sister andnatashahe kissed his sister holding her hand in his as was their wonthow are you mary how did you manage to get here said he in a voiceas calm and aloof as his lookhad he screamed in agony that scream would not have struck such horrorinto princess marys heart as the tone of his voiceand have you brought little nicholas he asked in the same slow quietmanner and with an obvious effort to rememberhow are you now said princess mary herself surprised at what she wassayingthat my dear you must ask the doctor he replied and again makingan evident effort to be affectionate he said with his lips only hiswords clearly did not correspond to his thoughtsmerci chere amie detre venue  thank you for coming my dearprincess mary pressed his hand the pressure made him wince justperceptibly he was silent and she did not know what to say she nowunderstood what had happened to him two days before in his words histone and especially in that calm almost antagonistic look could befelt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world terriblein one who is alive evidently only with an effort did he understandanything living but it was obvious that he failed to understand notbecause he lacked the power to do so but because he understood somethingelsesomething the living did not and could not understandand whichwholly occupied his mindthere you see how strangely fate has brought us together said hebreaking the silence and pointing to natasha she looks after me allthe timeprincess mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such athing he the sensitive tender prince andrew how could he say thatbefore her whom he loved and who loved him had he expected to live hecould not have said those words in that offensively cold tone if he hadnot known that he was dying how could he have failed to pity her andhow could he speak like that in her presence the only explanation wasthat he was indifferent because something else much more importanthad been revealed to himthe conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke offmary came by way of ryazan said natashaprince andrew did not notice that she called his sister mary and onlyafter calling her so in his presence did natasha notice it herselfreally he askedthey told her that all moscow has been burned down and thatnatasha stopped it was impossible to talk it was plain that he wasmaking an effort to listen but could not do soyes they say its burned he said its a great pity and he gazedstraight before him absently stroking his mustache with his fingersand so you have met count nicholas mary prince andrew suddenly saidevidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them he wrote here that hetook a great liking to you he went on simply and calmly evidentlyunable to understand all the complex significance his words had forliving people if you liked him too it would be a good thing for youto get married he added rather more quickly as if pleased at havingfound words he had long been seekingprincess mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her except asa proof of how far away he now was from everything livingwhy talk of me she said quietly and glanced at natashanatasha who felt her glance did not look at her all three were againsilentandrew would you like princess mary suddenly said in a tremblingvoice would you like to see little nicholas he is always talkingabout youprince andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time butprincess mary who knew his face so well saw with horror that he didnot smile with pleasure or affection for his son but with quiet gentleirony because he thought she was trying what she believed to be the lastmeans of arousing himyes i shall be very glad to see him is he quite wellwhen little nicholas was brought into prince andrews room he looked athis father with frightened eyes but did not cry because no one elsewas crying prince andrew kissed him and evidently did not know what tosay to himwhen nicholas had been led away princess mary again went up to herbrother kissed him and unable to restrain her tears any longer beganto cryhe looked at her attentivelyis it about nicholas he askedprincess mary nodded her head weepingmary you know the gosp but he broke offwhat did you saynothing you mustnt cry here he said looking at her with the samecold expressionwhen princess mary began to cry he understood that she was crying atthe thought that little nicholas would be left without a father with agreat effort he tried to return to life and to see things from theirpoint of viewyes to them it must seem sad he thought but how simple it isthe fowls of the air sow not neither do they reap yet your fatherfeedeth them he said to himself and wished to say to princess marybut no they will take it their own way they wont understand theycant understand that all those feelings they prize soall ourfeelings all those ideas that seem so important to us are unnecessarywe cannot understand one another and he remained silentprince andrews little son was seven he could scarcely read and knewnothing after that day he lived through many things gaining knowledgeobservation and experience but had he possessed all the faculties heafterwards acquired he could not have had a better or more profoundunderstanding of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between hisfather mary and natasha than he had then he understood itcompletely and leaving the room without crying went silently up tonatasha who had come out with him and looked shyly at her with hisbeautiful thoughtful eyes then his uplifted rosy upper lip trembledand leaning his head against her he began to cryafter that he avoided dessalles and the countess who caressed him andeither sat alone or came timidly to princess mary or to natasha of whomhe seemed even fonder than of his aunt and clung to them quietly andshylywhen princess mary had left prince andrew she fully understood whatnatashas face had told her she did not speak any more to natasha ofhopes of saving his life she took turns with her beside his sofa anddid not cry any more but prayed continually turning in soul to thateternal and unfathomable whose presence above the dying man was now soevidentnot only did prince andrew know he would die but he felt that he wasdying and was already half dead he was conscious of an aloofness fromeverything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existencewithout haste or agitation he awaited what was coming that inexorableeternal distant and unknown the presence of which he had feltcontinually all his lifewas now near to him and by the strangelightness he experienced almost comprehensible and palpableformerly he had feared the end he had twice experienced that terriblytormenting fear of deaththe endbut now he no longer understood thatfearhe had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top beforehim and he looked at the fallow field the bushes and the sky andknew that he was face to face with death when he came to himself afterbeing wounded and the flower of eternal unfettered love had instantlyunfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of life thathad restrained it he no longer feared death and ceased to think aboutitduring the hours of solitude suffering and partial delirium he spentafter he was wounded the more deeply he penetrated into the newprinciple of eternal love revealed to him the more he unconsciouslydetached himself from earthly life to love everything and everybody andalways to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone not tolive this earthly life and the more imbued he became with thatprinciple of love the more he renounced life and the more completely hedestroyed that dreadful barrier whichin the absence of such lovestands between life and death when during those first days heremembered that he would have to die he said to himself well what ofit so much the betterbut after the night in mytishchi when half delirious he had seen herfor whom he longed appear before him and having pressed her hand to hislips had shed gentle happy tears love for a particular woman againcrept unobserved into his heart and once more bound him to life andjoyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind recalling themoment at the ambulance station when he had seen kuragin he could notnow regain the feeling he then had but was tormented by the questionwhether kuragin was alive and he dared not inquirehis illness pursued its normal physical course but what natashareferred to when she said this suddenly happened had occurred twodays before princess mary arrived it was the last spiritual strugglebetween life and death in which death gained the victory it was theunexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life aspresented to him in the form of his love for natasha and a last thoughultimately vanquished attack of terror before the unknownit was evening as usual after dinner he was slightly feverish and histhoughts were preternaturally clear sonya was sitting by the table hebegan to doze suddenly a feeling of happiness seized himah she has come thought heand so it was in sonyas place sat natasha who had just come innoiselesslysince she had begun looking after him he had always experienced thisphysical consciousness of her nearness she was sitting in an armchairplaced sideways screening the light of the candle from him and wasknitting a stocking she had learned to knit stockings since princeandrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so well as oldnurses who knit stockings and that there is something soothing in theknitting of stockings the needles clicked lightly in her slenderrapidly moving hands and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile ofher drooping face she moved and the ball rolled off her knees shestarted glanced round at him and screening the candle with her handstooped carefully with a supple and exact movement picked up the balland regained her former positionhe looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a deepbreath after stooping but refrained from doing so and breathedcautiouslyat the troitsa monastery they had spoken of the past and he had toldher that if he lived he would always thank god for his wound which hadbrought them together again but after that they never spoke of thefuturecan it or can it not be he now thought as he looked at her andlistened to the light click of the steel needles can fate have broughtme to her so strangely only for me to die is it possible that thetruth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that i have spentmy life in falsity i love her more than anything in the world but whatam i to do if i love her he thought and he involuntarily groanedfrom a habit acquired during his sufferingson hearing that sound natasha put down the stocking leaned nearer tohim and suddenly noticing his shining eyes stepped lightly up to himand bent over himyou are not asleepno i have been looking at you a long time i felt you come in no oneelse gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do that lighti want to weep for joynatasha drew closer to him her face shone with rapturous joynatasha i love you too much more than anything in the worldand ishe turned away for an instant why too much she askedwhy too much well what do you what do you feel in your soul yourwhole soulshall i live what do you thinki am sure of it sure natasha almost shouted taking hold of both hishands with a passionate movementhe remained silent awhilehow good it would be and taking her hand he kissed itnatasha felt happy and agitated but at once remembered that this wouldnot do and that he had to be quietbut you have not slept she said repressing her joy try to sleeppleasehe pressed her hand and released it and she went back to the candle andsat down again in her former position twice she turned and looked athim and her eyes met his beaming at her she set herself a task on herstocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finishedsoon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep he did not sleep long andsuddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspirationas he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that nowalways occupied his mindabout life and death and chiefly about deathhe felt himself nearer to itlove what is love he thoughtlove hinders death love is life all everything that i understand iunderstand only because i love everything is everything exists onlybecause i love everything is united by it alone love is god and todie means that i a particle of love shall return to the general andeternal source these thoughts seemed to him comforting but they wereonly thoughts something was lacking in them they were not clear theywere too onesidedly personal and brainspun and there was the formeragitation and obscurity he fell asleephe dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in but that hewas quite well and unwounded many various indifferent andinsignificant people appeared before him he talked to them anddiscussed something trivial they were preparing to go away somewhereprince andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he hadmore important cares but he continued to speak surprising them byempty witticisms gradually unnoticed all these persons began todisappear and a single question that of the closed door superseded allelse he rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it everythingdepended on whether he was or was not in time to lock it he went andtried to hurry but his legs refused to move and he knew he would not bein time to lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers hewas seized by an agonizing fear and that fear was the fear of death itstood behind the door but just when he was clumsily creeping toward thedoor that dreadful something on the other side was already pressingagainst it and forcing its way in something not humandeathwasbreaking in through that door and had to be kept out he seized thedoor making a final effort to hold it backto lock it was no longerpossiblebut his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door pushed frombehind by that terror opened and closed againonce again it pushed from outside his last superhuman efforts were vainand both halves of the door noiselessly opened it entered and it wasdeath and prince andrew diedbut at the instant he died prince andrew remembered that he was asleepand at the very instant he died having made an effort he awokeyes it was death i diedand woke up yes death is an awakeningand all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had tillthen concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision he feltas if powers till then confined within him had been liberated and thatstrange lightness did not again leave himwhen waking in a cold perspiration he moved on the divan natasha wentup and asked him what was the matter he did not answer and looked ather strangely not understandingthat was what had happened to him two days before princess marysarrival from that day as the doctor expressed it the wasting feverassumed a malignant character but what the doctor said did not interestnatasha she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were moreconvincingfrom that day an awakening from life came to prince andrew together withhis awakening from sleep and compared to the duration of life it didnot seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to theduration of a dreamthere was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slowawakeninghis last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way bothprincess mary and natasha who did not leave him felt this they didnot weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt thatthey were not attending on him he was no longer there he had leftthem but on what reminded them most closely of himhis body both feltthis so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did notaffect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their griefneither in his presence nor out of it did they weep nor did they evertalk to one another about him they felt that they could not express inwords what they understoodthey both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly deeper and deeperaway from them and they both knew that this had to be so and that itwas righthe confessed and received communion everyone came to take leave ofhim when they brought his son to him he pressed his lips to the boysand turned away not because he felt it hard and sad princess mary andnatasha understood that but simply because he thought it was all thatwas required of him but when they told him to bless the boy he didwhat was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there wasanything else he should dowhen the last convulsions of the body which the spirit was leavingoccurred princess mary and natasha were presentis it over said princess mary when his body had for a few minuteslain motionless growing cold before them natasha went up looked atthe dead eyes and hastened to close them she closed them but did notkiss them but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of himhisbodywhere has he gone where is he nowwhen the body washed and dressed lay in the coffin on a tableeveryone came to take leave of him and they all weptlittle nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful perplexitythe countess and sonya cried from pity for natasha and because he was nomore the old count cried because he felt that before long he toomust take the same terrible stepnatasha and princess mary also wept now but not because of their ownpersonal grief they wept with a reverent and softening emotion whichhad taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the simpleand solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in theirpresencemans mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness butthe desire to find those causes is implanted in mans soul and withoutconsidering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one ofwhich taken separately may seem to be the cause he snatches at thefirst approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and saysthis is the cause in historical events where the actions of men arethe subject of observation the first and most primitive approximationto present itself was the will of the gods and after that the will ofthose who stood in the most prominent positionthe heroes of historybut we need only penetrate to the essence of any historic eventwhichlies in the activity of the general mass of men who take part in ittobe convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control theactions of the mass but is itself continually controlled it may seem tobe a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning ofhistorical events this way or that yet there is the same differencebetween a man who says that the people of the west moved on the eastbecause napoleon wished it and a man who says that this happened becauseit had to happen as there is between those who declared that the earthwas stationary and that the planets moved round it and those whoadmitted that they did not know what upheld the earth but knew therewere laws directing its movement and that of the other planets thereis and can be no cause of an historical event except the one cause ofall causes but there are laws directing events and some of these lawsare known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehendthe discovery of these laws is only possible when we have quiteabandoned the attempt to find the cause in the will of some one manjust as the discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets waspossible only when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of theearththe historians consider that next to the battle of borodino and theoccupation of moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire the mostimportant episode of the war of  was the movement of the russianarmy from the ryazana to the kaluga road and to the tarutino campthesocalled flank march across the krasnaya pakhra river they ascribe theglory of that achievement of genius to different men and dispute as towhom the honor is due even foreign historians including the frenchacknowledge the genius of the russian commanders when they speak of thatflank march but it is hard to understand why military writers andfollowing them others consider this flank march to be the profoundconception of some one man who saved russia and destroyed napoleon inthe first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and geniusof this movement lay for not much mental effort was needed to see thatthe best position for an army when it is not being attacked is wherethere are most provisions and even a dull boy of thirteen could haveguessed that the best position for an army after its retreat from moscowin  was on the kaluga road so it is impossible to understand bywhat reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuverwas a profound one and it is even more difficult to understand just whythey think that this maneuver was calculated to save russia and destroythe french for this flank march had it been preceded accompanied orfollowed by other circumstances might have proved ruinous to therussians and salutary for the french if the position of the russianarmy really began to improve from the time of that march it does not atall follow that the march was the cause of itthat flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to therussian army but might in other circumstances have led to itsdestruction what would have happened had moscow not burned down ifmurat had not lost sight of the russians if napoleon had not remainedinactive if the russian army at krasnaya pakhra had given battle asbennigsen and barclay advised what would have happened had the frenchattacked the russians while they were marching beyond the pakhra whatwould have happened if on approaching tarutino napoleon had attackedthe russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when heattacked them at smolensk what would have happened had the french movedon petersburg in any of these eventualities the flank march thatbrought salvation might have proved disastrousthe third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studyinghistory deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot beattributed to any one man that no one ever foresaw it and that inreality like the retreat from fili it did not suggest itself to anyonein its entirety but resultedmoment by moment step by step event byeventfrom an endless number of most diverse circumstances and was onlyseen in its entirety when it had been accomplished and belonged to thepastat the council at fili the prevailing thought in the minds of therussian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself namely adirect retreat by the nizhni road in proof of this there is the factthat the majority of the council voted for such a retreat and above allthere is the wellknown conversation after the council between thecommander in chief and lanskoy who was in charge of the commissariatdepartment lanskoy informed the commanderinchief that the armysupplies were for the most part stored along the oka in the tula andryazan provinces and that if they retreated on nizhni the army would beseparated from its supplies by the broad river oka which cannot becrossed early in winter this was the first indication of the necessityof deviating from what had previously seemed the most natural courseadirect retreat on nizhninovgorod the army turned more to the southalong the ryazan road and nearer to its supplies subsequently theinactivity of the french who even lost sight of the russian armyconcern for the safety of the arsenal at tula and especially theadvantages of drawing nearer to its supplies caused the army to turnstill further south to the tula road having crossed over by a forcedmarch to the tula road beyond the pakhra the russian commandersintended to remain at podolsk and had no thought of the tarutinoposition but innumerable circumstances and the reappearance of frenchtroops who had for a time lost touch with the russians and projects ofgiving battle and above all the abundance of provisions in kalugaprovince obliged our army to turn still more to the south and to crossfrom the tula to the kaluga road and go to tarutino which was betweenthe roads along which those supplies lay just as it is impossible tosay when it was decided to abandon moscow so it is impossible to sayprecisely when or by whom it was decided to move to tarutino onlywhen the army had got there as the result of innumerable and varyingforces did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired thismovement and long ago foreseen its resultthe famous flank movement merely consisted in this after the advance ofthe french had ceased the russian army which had been continuallyretreating straight back from the invaders deviated from that directcourse and not finding itself pursued was naturally drawn toward thedistrict where supplies were abundantif instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading therussian army we picture that army without any leaders it could nothave done anything but make a return movement toward moscow describingan arc in the direction where most provisions were to be found and wherethe country was richestthat movement from the nizhni to the ryazan tula and kaluga roads wasso natural that even the russian marauders moved in that direction anddemands were sent from petersburg for kutuzov to take his army that wayat tarutino kutuzov received what was almost a reprimand from theemperor for having moved his army along the ryazan road and theemperors letter indicated to him the very position he had alreadyoccupied near kalugahaving rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by thewhole campaign and by the battle of borodino the russian armywhen thestrength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was receivedassumed the position natural to itkutuzovs merit lay not in any strategic maneuver of genius as it iscalled but in the fact that he alone understood the significance ofwhat had happened he alone then understood the meaning of the frencharmys inactivity he alone continued to assert that the battle ofborodino had been a victory he alonewho as commanderinchief mighthave been expected to be eager to attackemployed his whole strength torestrain the russian army from useless engagementsthe beast wounded at borodino was lying where the fleeing hunter hadleft him but whether he was still alive whether he was strong andmerely lying low the hunter did not know suddenly the beast was heardto moanthe moan of that wounded beast the french army which betrayed itscalamitous condition was the sending of lauriston to kutuzovs camp withovertures for peacenapoleon with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head wasright wrote to kutuzov the first words that occurred to him thoughthey were meaninglessmonsieur le prince koutouzov i am sending one of my adjutantsgeneralto discuss several interesting questions with you i beg your highnessto credit what he says to you especially when he expresses thesentiment of esteem and special regard i have long entertained for yourperson this letter having no other object i pray god monsieur leprince koutouzov to keep you in his holy and gracious protectionnapoleon moscow october  kutuzov replied i should be cursed by posterity were i looked on asthe initiator of a settlement of any sort such is the present spirit ofmy nation but he continued to exert all his powers to restrain histroops from attackingduring the month that the french troops were pillaging in moscow and therussian troops were quietly encamped at tarutino a change had takenplace in the relative strength of the two armiesboth in spirit and innumberas a result of which the superiority had passed to the russianside though the condition and numbers of the french army were unknownto the russians as soon as that change occurred the need of attackingat once showed itself by countless signs these signs were lauristonsmission the abundance of provisions at tarutino the reports coming infrom all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the french the flow ofrecruits to our regiments the fine weather the long rest the russiansoldiers had enjoyed and the impatience to do what they had beenassembled for which usually shows itself in an army that has beenresting curiosity as to what the french army so long lost sight ofwas doing the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up tothe french stationed at tarutino the news of easy successes gained bypeasants and guerrilla troops over the french the envy aroused by thisthe desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every russian as long asthe french were in moscow and above all a dim consciousness in everysoldiers mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed andthat the advantage was now on our side there was a substantial changein the relative strength and an advance had become inevitable and atonce as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the minute handhas completed a full circle this change was shown by an increasedactivity whirring and chiming in the higher spheresthe russian army was commanded by kutuzov and his staff and also by theemperor from petersburg before the news of the abandonment of moscowhad been received in petersburg a detailed plan of the whole campaignhad been drawn up and sent to kutuzov for his guidance though this planhad been drawn up on the supposition that moscow was still in our handsit was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action kutuzovonly replied that movements arranged from a distance were alwaysdifficult to execute so fresh instructions were sent for the solutionof difficulties that might be encountered as well as fresh people whowere to watch kutuzovs actions and report upon thembesides this the whole staff of the russian army was now reorganizedthe posts left vacant by bagration who had been killed and by barclaywho had gone away in dudgeon had to be filled very seriousconsideration was given to the question whether it would be better toput a in bs place and b in ds or on the contrary to put d in asplace and so onas if anything more than as or bs satisfactiondepended on thisas a result of the hostility between kutuzov and bennigsen his chief ofstaff the presence of confidential representatives of the emperor andthese transfers a more than usually complicated play of parties wasgoing on among the staff of the army a was undermining b d wasundermining c and so on in all possible combinations and permutationsin all these plottings the subject of intrigue was generally the conductof the war which all these men believed they were directing but thisaffair of the war went on independently of them as it had to go thatis never in the way people devised but flowing always from theessential attitude of the masses only in the highest spheres did allthese schemes crossings and interminglings appear to be a truereflection of what had to happenprince michael ilarionovich wrote the emperor on the second of octoberin a letter that reached kutuzov after the battle at tarutino sinceseptember  moscow has been in the hands of the enemy your last reportswere written on the twentieth and during all this time not only has noaction been taken against the enemy or for the relief of the ancientcapital but according to your last report you have even retreatedfarther serpukhov is already occupied by an enemy detachment and tulawith its famous arsenal so indispensable to the army is in danger fromgeneral wintzingerodes reports i see that an enemy corps of tenthousand men is moving on the petersburg road another corps of severalthousand men is moving on dmitrov a third has advanced along thevladimir road and a fourth rather considerable detachment is stationedbetween ruza and mozhaysk napoleon himself was in moscow as late as thetwentyfifth in view of all this information when the enemy hasscattered his forces in large detachments and with napoleon and hisguards in moscow is it possible that the enemys forces confronting youare so considerable as not to allow of your taking the offensive on thecontrary he is probably pursuing you with detachments or at most withan army corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you it would seemthat availing yourself of these circumstances you might advantageouslyattack a weaker one and annihilate him or at least oblige him toretreat retaining in our hands an important part of the provinces nowoccupied by the enemy and thereby averting danger from tula and othertowns in the interior you will be responsible if the enemy is able todirect a force of any size against petersburg to threaten this capitalin which it has not been possible to retain many troops for with thearmy entrusted to you and acting with resolution and energy you haveample means to avert this fresh calamity remember that you have stillto answer to our offended country for the loss of moscow you haveexperienced my readiness to reward you that readiness will not weakenin me but i and russia have a right to expect from you all the zealfirmness and success which your intellect military talent and thecourage of the troops you command justify us in expectingbut by the time this letter which proved that the real relation of theforces had already made itself felt in petersburg was dispatchedkutuzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain the army hecommanded from attacking and a battle had taken placeon the second of october a cossack shapovalov who was out scoutingkilled one hare and wounded another following the wounded hare he madehis way far into the forest and came upon the left flank of muratsarmy encamped there without any precautions the cossack laughinglytold his comrades how he had almost fallen into the hands of the frencha cornet hearing the story informed his commanderthe cossack was sent for and questioned the cossack officers wished totake advantage of this chance to capture some horses but one of thesuperior officers who was acquainted with the higher authoritiesreported the incident to a general on the staff the state of things onthe staff had of late been exceedingly strained ermolov had been to seebennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to use hisinfluence with the commanderinchief to induce him to take theoffensiveif i did not know you i should think you did not want what you areasking for i need only advise anything and his highness is sure to dothe opposite replied bennigsenthe cossacks report confirmed by horse patrols who were sent out wasthe final proof that events had matured the tightly coiled spring wasreleased the clock began to whirr and the chimes to play despite allhis supposed power his intellect his experience and his knowledge ofmen kutuzovhaving taken into consideration the cossacks report anote from bennigsen who sent personal reports to the emperor the wisheshe supposed the emperor to hold and the fact that all the generalsexpressed the same wishcould no longer check the inevitable movementand gave the order to do what he regarded as useless and harmfulgavehis approval that is to the accomplished factbennigsens note and the cossacks information that the left flank ofthe french was unguarded were merely final indications that it wasnecessary to order an attack and it was fixed for the fifth of octoberon the morning of the fourth of october kutuzov signed the dispositionstoll read them to ermolov asking him to attend to the furtherarrangementsall rightall right i havent time just now replied ermolov andleft the hutthe dispositions drawn up by toll were very good as in the austerlitzdispositions it was writtenthough not in german this timethe first column will march here and here the second column willmarch there and there and so on and on paper all these columnsarrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemyeverything had been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositionsand as is always the case not a single column reached its place at theappointed timewhen the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had beenprepared an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to ermolov todeal with a young officer of the horse guards kutuzovs orderlypleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him went toermolovs quartersgone away said ermolovs orderlythe officer of the horse guards went to a general with whom ermolov wasoften to be foundno and the generals out toothe officer mounting his horse rode off to someone elseno hes gone outif only they dont make me responsible for this delay what a nuisanceit is thought the officer and he rode round the whole camp one mansaid he had seen ermolov ride past with some other generals others saidhe must have returned home the officer searched till six oclock in theevening without even stopping to eat ermolov was nowhere to be foundand no one knew where he was the officer snatched a little food at acomrades and rode again to the vanguard to find miloradovichmiloradovich too was away but here he was told that he had gone to aball at general kikins and that ermolov was probably there toobut where is itwhy there over at echkino said a cossack officer pointing to acountry house in the far distancewhat outside our linetheyve put two regiments as outposts and theyre having such a spreethere its awful two bands and three sets of singersthe officer rode out beyond our lines to echkino while still at adistance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldiers dance songproceeding from the housein the meadows in the meadows he heard accompanied by whistlingand the sound of a torban drowned every now and then by shouts thesesounds made his spirits rise but at the same time he was afraid that hewould be blamed for not having executed sooner the important orderentrusted to him it was already past eight oclock he dismounted andwent up into the porch of a large country house which had remainedintact between the russian and french forces in the refreshment roomand the hall footmen were bustling about with wine and viands groupsof singers stood outside the windows the officer was admitted andimmediately saw all the chief generals of the army together and amongthem ermolovs big imposing figure they all had their coats unbuttonedand were standing in a semicircle with flushed and animated faceslaughing loudly in the middle of the room a short handsome general witha red face was dancing the trepak with much spirit and agilityha ha ha bravo nicholas ivanych ha ha hathe officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a momenthe was doubly to blame and he would have preferred to wait but one ofthe generals espied him and hearing what he had come about informedermolovermolov came forward with a frown on his face and hearing what theofficer had to say took the papers from him without a wordyou think he went off just by chance said a comrade who was on thestaff that evening to the officer of the horse guards referring toermolov it was a trick it was done on purpose to get konovnitsyn intotrouble youll see what a mess therell be tomorrownext day the decrepit kutuzov having given orders to be called earlysaid his prayers dressed and with an unpleasant consciousness ofhaving to direct a battle he did not approve of got into his calecheand drove from letashovka a village three and a half miles fromtarutino to the place where the attacking columns were to meet he satin the caleche dozing and waking up by turns and listening for anysound of firing on the right as an indication that the action had begunbut all was still quiet a damp dull autumn morning was just dawning onapproaching tarutino kutuzov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses towater across the road along which he was driving kutuzov looked at themsearchingly stopped his carriage and inquired what regiment theybelonged to they belonged to a column that should have been far infront and in ambush long before then it may be a mistake thought theold commanderinchief but a little further on he saw infantryregiments with their arms piled and the soldiers only partly dressedeating their rye porridge and carrying fuel he sent for an officer theofficer reported that no order to advance had been receivedhow not rec kutuzov began but checked himself immediately andsent for a senior officer getting out of his caleche he waited withdrooping head and breathing heavily pacing silently up and down wheneykhen the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned appearedkutuzov went purple in the face not because that officer was to blamefor the mistake but because he was an object of sufficient importancefor him to vent his wrath on trembling and panting the old man fellinto that state of fury in which he sometimes used to roll on theground and he fell upon eykhen threatening him with his handsshouting and loading him with gross abuse another man captain brozinwho happened to turn up and who was not at all to blame suffered thesame fatewhat sort of another blackguard are you ill have you shotscoundrels yelled kutuzov in a hoarse voice waving his arms andreelinghe was suffering physically he the commanderinchief a serenehighness who everybody said possessed powers such as no man had ever hadin russia to be placed in this positionmade the laughingstock of thewhole army i neednt have been in such a hurry to pray about today orhave kept awake thinking everything over all night thought he tohimself when i was a chit of an officer no one would have dared tomock me so and now he was in a state of physical suffering as iffrom corporal punishment and could not avoid expressing it by cries ofanger and distress but his strength soon began to fail him and lookingabout him conscious of having said much that was amiss he again gotinto his caleche and drove back in silencehis wrath once expended did not return and blinking feebly helistened to excuses and selfjustifications ermolov did not come to seehim till the next day and to the insistence of bennigsen konovnitsynand toll that the movement that had miscarried should be executed nextday and once more kutuzov had to consentnext day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the eveningand advanced during the night it was an autumn night with dark purpleclouds but no rain the ground was damp but not muddy and the troopsadvanced noiselessly only occasionally a jingling of the artillerycould be faintly heard the men were forbidden to talk out loud tosmoke their pipes or to strike a light and they tried to prevent theirhorses neighing the secrecy of the undertaking heightened its charm andthey marched gaily some columns supposing they had reached theirdestination halted piled arms and settled down on the cold groundbut the majority marched all night and arrived at places where theyevidently should not have beenonly count orlovdenisov with his cossacks the least importantdetachment of all got to his appointed place at the right time thisdetachment halted at the outskirts of a forest on the path leading fromthe village of stromilova to dmitrovsktoward dawn count orlovdenisov who had dozed off was awakened by adeserter from the french army being brought to him this was a polishsergeant of poniatowskis corps who explained in polish that he hadcome over because he had been slighted in the service that he oughtlong ago to have been made an officer that he was braver than any ofthem and so he had left them and wished to pay them out he said thatmurat was spending the night less than a mile from where they were andthat if they would let him have a convoy of a hundred men he wouldcapture him alive count orlovdenisov consulted his fellow officersthe offer was too tempting to be refused everyone volunteered to go andeverybody advised making the attempt after much disputing and arguingmajorgeneral grekov with two cossack regiments decided to go with thepolish sergeantnow remember said count orlovdenisov to the sergeant at partingif you have been lying ill have you hanged like a dog but if itstrue you shall have a hundred gold pieceswithout replying the sergeant with a resolute air mounted and rodeaway with grekov whose men had quickly assembled they disappeared intothe forest and count orlovdenisov having seen grekov off returnedshivering from the freshness of the early dawn and excited by what hehad undertaken on his own responsibility and began looking at the enemycamp now just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dyingcampfires our columns ought to have begun to appear on an opendeclivity to his right he looked in that direction but though thecolumns would have been visible quite far off they were not to be seenit seemed to the count that things were beginning to stir in the frenchcamp and his keensighted adjutant confirmed thisoh it is really too late said count orlov looking at the campas often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before oureyes it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that thesergeant was an impostor that he had lied and that the whole russianattack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments which hewould lead away heaven only knew where how could one capture acommanderinchief from among such a mass of troopsi am sure that rascal was lying said the countthey can still be called back said one of his suite who like countorlov felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the enemyscampeh really what do you think should we let them go on or notwill you have them fetched backfetch them back fetch them back said count orlov with suddendetermination looking at his watch it will be too late it is quitelightand the adjutant galloped through the forest after grekov when grekovreturned count orlovdenisov excited both by the abandoned attempt andby vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear aswell as by the proximity of the enemy resolved to advance all his menfelt the same excitementmount he commanded in a whisper the men took their places andcrossed themselves forward with gods aidhurrahahah reverberated in the forest and the cossack companiestrailing their lances and advancing one after another as if poured outof a sack dashed gaily across the brook toward the campone desperate frightened yell from the first french soldier who saw thecossacks and all who were in the camp undressed and only just wakingup ran off in all directions abandoning cannons muskets and horseshad the cossacks pursued the french without heeding what was behind andaround them they would have captured murat and everything there thatwas what the officers desired but it was impossible to make thecossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners none of themlistened to orders fifteen hundred prisoners and thirtyeight guns weretaken on the spot besides standards and what seemed most important tothe cossacks horses saddles horsecloths and the like all this hadto be dealt with the prisoners and guns secured the booty dividednotwithout some shouting and even a little fighting among themselvesandit was on this that the cossacks all busied themselvesthe french not being farther pursued began to recover themselves theyformed into detachments and began firing orlovdenisov still waitingfor the other columns to arrive advanced no furthermeantime according to the dispositions which said that the firstcolumn will march and so on the infantry of the belated columnscommanded by bennigsen and directed by toll had started in due orderand as always happens had got somewhere but not to their appointedplaces as always happens the men starting cheerfully began to haltmurmurs were heard there was a sense of confusion and finally abackward movement adjutants and generals galloped about shouted grewangry quarreled said they had come quite wrong and were late gavevent to a little abuse and at last gave it all up and went forwardsimply to get somewhere we shall get somewhere or other and they didindeed get somewhere though not to their right places a few eventuallyeven got to their right place but too late to be of any use and only intime to be fired at toll who in this battle played the part ofweyrother at austerlitz galloped assiduously from place to placefinding everything upside down everywhere thus he stumbled on bagovutscorps in a wood when it was already broad daylight though the corpsshould long before have joined orlovdenisov excited and vexed by thefailure and supposing that someone must be responsible for it tollgalloped up to the commander of the corps and began upbraiding himseverely saying that he ought to be shot general bagovut a fightingold soldier of placid temperament being also upset by all the delayconfusion and crosspurposes fell into a rage to everybodys surpriseand quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable thingsto tolli prefer not to take lessons from anyone but i can die with my men aswell as anybody he said and advanced with a single divisioncoming out onto a field under the enemys fire this brave general wentstraight ahead leading his men under fire without considering in hisagitation whether going into action now with a single division wouldbe of any use or no danger cannon balls and bullets were just what heneeded in his angry mood one of the first bullets killed him and otherbullets killed many of his men and his division remained under fire forsome time quite uselesslymeanwhile another column was to have attacked the french from the frontbut kutuzov accompanied that column he well knew that nothing butconfusion would come of this battle undertaken against his will and asfar as was in his power held the troops back he did not advancehe rode silently on his small gray horse indolently answeringsuggestions that they should attackthe word attack is always on your tongue but you dont see that we areunable to execute complicated maneuvers said he to miloradovich whoasked permission to advancewe couldnt take murat prisoner this morning or get to the place intime and nothing can be done now he replied to someone elsewhen kutuzov was informed that at the french rearwhere according tothe reports of the cossacks there had previously been nobodythere werenow two battalions of poles he gave a sidelong glance at ermolov whowas behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous dayyou see they are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds butas soon as one gets to business nothing is ready and the enemyforewarned takes measures accordinglyermolov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these wordshe understood that for him the storm had blown over and that kutuzovwould content himself with that hinthes having a little fun at my expense said ermolov softly nudgingwith his knee raevski who was at his sidesoon after this ermolov moved up to kutuzov and respectfully remarkedit is not too late yet your highnessthe enemy has not gone awayifyou were to order an attack if not the guards will not so much as seea little smokekutuzov did not reply but when they reported to him that murats troopswere in retreat he ordered an advance though at every hundred paces hehalted for three quarters of an hourthe whole battle consisted in what orlovdenisovs cossacks had donethe rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselesslyin consequence of this battle kutuzov received a diamond decoration andbennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles others alsoreceived pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various gradesand following the battle fresh changes were made in the staffthats how everything is done with us all topsyturvy said therussian officers and generals after the tarutino battle letting it beunderstood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that weourselves should not have done so just as people speak today butpeople who talk like that either do not know what they are talking aboutor deliberately deceive themselves no battletarutino borodino orausterlitztakes place as those who planned it anticipated that is anessential conditiona countless number of free forces for nowhere is man freer than duringa battle where it is a question of life and death influence the coursetaken by the fight and that course never can be known in advance andnever coincides with the direction of any one forceif many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a givenbody the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one of thoseforces but will always be a meanwhat in mechanics is represented bythe diagonal of a parallelogram of forcesif in the descriptions given by historians especially french ones wefind their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previouslyformed plans the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptionsare falsethe battle of tarutino obviously did not attain the aim toll had inviewto lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by thedispositions nor that which count orlovdenisov may have had in viewto take murat prisoner nor the result of immediately destroying thewhole corps which bennigsen and others may have had in view nor theaim of the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish himselfnor that of the cossack who wanted more booty than he got and so onbut if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and what all therussians of that day desiredto drive the french out of russia anddestroy their armyit is quite clear that the battle of tarutino justbecause of its incongruities was exactly what was wanted at that stageof the campaign it would be difficult and even impossible to imagineany result more opportune than the actual outcome of this battle with aminimum of effort and insignificant losses despite the greatestconfusion the most important results of the whole campaign wereattained the transition from retreat to advance an exposure of theweakness of the french and the administration of that shock whichnapoleons army had only awaited to begin its flightnapoleon enters moscow after the brilliant victory de la moskowa therecan be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in thehands of the french the russians retreat and abandon their ancientcapital moscow abounding in provisions arms munitions andincalculable wealth is in napoleons hands the russian army only halfthe strength of the french does not make a single attempt to attack fora whole month napoleons position is most brilliant he can either fallon the russian army with double its strength and destroy it negotiatean advantageous peace or in case of a refusal make a menacing move onpetersburg or even in the case of a reverse return to smolensk orvilna or remain in moscow in short no special genius would seem to berequired to retain the brilliant position the french held at that timefor that only very simple and easy steps were necessary not to allowthe troops to loot to prepare winter clothingof which there wassufficient in moscow for the whole armyand methodically to collect theprovisions of which according to the french historians there wereenough in moscow to supply the whole army for six months yet napoleonthat greatest of all geniuses who the historians declare had control ofthe army took none of these stepshe not merely did nothing of the kind but on the contrary he used hispower to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open tohim of all that napoleon might have done wintering in moscowadvancing on petersburg or on nizhninovgorod or retiring by a morenortherly or more southerly route say by the road kutuzov afterwardstook nothing more stupid or disastrous can be imagined than what heactually did he remained in moscow till october letting the troopsplunder the city then hesitating whether to leave a garrison behindhim he quitted moscow approached kutuzov without joining battleturned to the right and reached maloyaroslavets again withoutattempting to break through and take the road kutuzov took but retiringinstead to mozhaysk along the devastated smolensk road nothing morestupid than that could have been devised or more disastrous for thearmy as the sequel showed had napoleons aim been to destroy his armythe most skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series ofactions that would so completely have accomplished that purposeindependently of anything the russian army might donapoleon the man of genius did this but to say that he destroyed hisarmy because he wished to or because he was very stupid would be asunjust as to say that he had brought his troops to moscow because hewished to and because he was very clever and a geniusin both cases his personal activity having no more force than thepersonal activity of any soldier merely coincided with the laws thatguided the eventthe historians quite falsely represent napoleons faculties as havingweakened in moscow and do so only because the results did not justifyhis actions he employed all his ability and strength to do the best hecould for himself and his army as he had done previously and as he didsubsequently in  his activity at that time was no less astoundingthan it was in egypt in italy in austria and in prussia we do notknow for certain in how far his genius was genuine in egyptwhere fortycenturies looked down upon his grandeurfor his great exploits thereare all told us by frenchmen we cannot accurately estimate his geniusin austria or prussia for we have to draw our information from frenchor german sources and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corpswithout fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline germansto recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on ingermany but we thank god have no need to recognize his genius inorder to hide our shame we have paid for the right to look at thematter plainly and simply and we will not abandon that righthis activity in moscow was as amazing and as full of genius aselsewhere order after order and plan after plan were issued by him fromthe time he entered moscow till the time he left it the absence ofcitizens and of a deputation and even the burning of moscow did notdisconcert him he did not lose sight either of the welfare of his armyor of the doings of the enemy or of the welfare of the people ofrussia or of the direction of affairs in paris or of diplomaticconsiderations concerning the terms of the anticipated peacewith regard to military matters napoleon immediately on his entry intomoscow gave general sabastiani strict orders to observe the movements ofthe russian army sent army corps out along the different roads andcharged murat to find kutuzov then he gave careful directions about thefortification of the kremlin and drew up a brilliant plan for a futurecampaign over the whole map of russiawith regard to diplomatic questions napoleon summoned captain yakovlevwho had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how to get out ofmoscow minutely explained to him his whole policy and his magnanimityand having written a letter to the emperor alexander in which heconsidered it his duty to inform his friend and brother that rostopchinhad managed affairs badly in moscow he dispatched yakovlev topetersburghaving similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to tutolmin hedispatched that old man also to petersburg to negotiatewith regard to legal matters

and despite hispreoccupation with state affairs himself visited the theaters that wereestablished by his orderin regard to philanthropy the greatest virtue of crowned headsnapoleon also did all in his power he caused the words maison de mamere to be inscribed on the charitable institutions thereby combiningtender filial affection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch hevisited the foundling hospital and allowing the orphans saved by him tokiss his white hands graciously conversed with tutolmin then asthiers eloquently recounts he ordered his soldiers to be paid in forgedrussian money which he had prepared raising the use of these means byan act worthy of himself and of the french army he let relief bedistributed to those who had been burned out but as food was tooprecious to be given to foreigners who were for the most part enemiesnapoleon preferred to supply them with money with which to purchase foodfrom outside and had paper rubles distributed to themwith reference to army discipline orders were continually being issuedto inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance of military dutiesand to suppress robberybut strange to say all these measures efforts and planswhich werenot at all worse than others issued in similar circumstancesdid notaffect the essence of the matter but like the hands of a clock detachedfrom the mechanism swung about in an arbitrary and aimless way withoutengaging the cogwheelswith reference to the military sidethe plan of campaignthat work ofgenius of which thiers remarks that his genius never devised anythingmore profound more skillful or more admirable and enters into apolemic with m fain to prove that this work of genius must be referrednot to the fourth but to the fifteenth of octoberthat plan never wasor could be executed for it was quite out of touch with the facts ofthe case the fortifying of the kremlin for which la mosquee asnapoleon termed the church of basil the beatified was to have beenrazed to the ground proved quite useless the mining of the kremlinonly helped toward fulfilling napoleons wish that it should be blown upwhen he left moscowas a child wants the floor on which he has hurthimself to be beaten the pursuit of the russian army about whichnapoleon was so concerned produced an unheardof result the frenchgenerals lost touch with the russian army of sixty thousand men andaccording to thiers it was only eventually found like a lost pin bythe skilland apparently the geniusof muratwith reference to diplomacy all napoleons arguments as to hismagnanimity and justice both to tutolmin and to yakovlev whose chiefconcern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance proved uselessalexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to theirembassagewith regard to legal matters after the execution of the supposedincendiaries the rest of moscow burned downwith regard to administrative matters the establishment of amunicipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certainpeople who formed part of that municipality and under pretext ofpreserving order looted moscow or saved their own property from beinglootedwith regard to religion as to which in egypt matters had so easily beensettled by napoleons visit to a mosque no results were achieved twoor three priests who were found in moscow did try to carry outnapoleons wish but one of them was slapped in the face by a frenchsoldier while conducting service and a french official reported ofanother that the priest whom i found and invited to say mass cleanedand locked up the church that night the doors were again broken openthe padlocks smashed the books mutilated and other disordersperpetratedwith reference to commerce the proclamation to industrious workmen andto peasants evoked no response there were no industrious workmen andthe peasants caught the commissaries who ventured too far out of townwith the proclamation and killed themas to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troopsthese did not meet with success either the theaters set up in thekremlin and in posnyakovs house were closed again at once because theactors and actresses were robbedeven philanthropy did not have the desired effect the genuine as wellas the false paper money which flooded moscow lost its value thefrench collecting booty cared only for gold not only was the papermoney valueless which napoleon so graciously distributed to theunfortunate but even silver lost its value in relation to goldbut the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders givenby the authorities at that time was napoleons attempt to stop thelooting and reestablish disciplinethis is what the army authorities were reportinglooting continues in the city despite the decrees against it order isnot yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in alawful manner the sutlers alone venture to trade and they sell stolengoodsthe neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of therd corps who not satisfied with taking from the unfortunateinhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left even havethe ferocity to wound them with their sabers as i have repeatedlywitnessednothing new except that the soldiers are robbing and pillagingoctober robbery and pillaging continue there is a band of thieves in ourdistrict who ought to be arrested by a strong forceoctober the emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders tostop pillage parties of marauding guards are continually seen returningto the kremlin among the old guard disorder and pillage were renewedmore violently than ever yesterday evening last night and today theemperor sees with regret that the picked soldiers appointed to guard hisperson who should set an example of discipline carry disobedience tosuch a point that they break into the cellars and stores containing armysupplies others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeyingsentinels and officers and have abused and beaten themthe grand marshal of the palace wrote the governor complainsbitterly that in spite of repeated orders the soldiers continue tocommit nuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windowsof the emperorthat army like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot theprovender which might have saved it from starvation disintegrated andperished with each additional day it remained in moscow but it did notgo awayit began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by thecapture of transport trains on the smolensk road and by the battle oftarutino the news of that battle of tarutino unexpectedly received bynapoleon at a review evoked in him a desire to punish the russiansthiers says and he issued the order for departure which the wholearmy was demandingfleeing from moscow the soldiers took with them everything they hadstolen napoleon too carried away his own personal tresor but onseeing the baggage trains that impeded the army he was thiers sayshorrorstruck and yet with his experience of war he did not order allthe superfluous vehicles to be burned as he had done with those of acertain marshal when approaching moscow he gazed at the caleches andcarriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a verygood thing as those vehicles could be used to carry provisions thesick and the woundedthe plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal whichfeels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing to study theskillful tactics and aims of napoleon and his army from the time itentered moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leapsand shudders of a mortally wounded animal very often a wounded animalhearing a rustle rushes straight at the hunters gun runs forward andback again and hastens its own end napoleon under pressure from hiswhole army did the same thing the rustle of the battle of tarutinofrightened the beast and it rushed forward onto the hunters gunreached him turned back and finallylike any wild beastran backalong the most disadvantageous and dangerous path where the old scentwas familiarduring the whole of that period napoleon who seems to us to have beenthe leader of all these movementsas the figurehead of a ship may seemto a savage to guide the vesselacted like a child who holding acouple of strings inside a carriage thinks he is driving itearly in the morning of the sixth of october pierre went out of theshed and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little bluegray dog with a long body and short bandy legs that jumped about himthis little dog lived in their shed sleeping beside karataev at nightit sometimes made excursions into the town but always returned againprobably it had never had an owner and it still belonged to nobody andhad no name the french called it azor the soldier who told storiescalled it femgalka karataev and others called it gray or sometimesflabby its lack of a master a name or even of a breed or any definitecolor did not seem to trouble the bluegray dog in the least its furrytail stood up firm and round as a plume its bandy legs served it sowell that it would often gracefully lift a hind leg and run very easilyand quickly on three legs as if disdaining to use all four everythingpleased it now it would roll on its back yelping with delight nowbask in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance and now frolicabout playing with a chip of wood or a strawpierres attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt the only remnantof his former clothing a pair of soldiers trousers which bykarataevs advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth and apeasant coat and cap physically he had changed much during this timehe no longer seemed stout though he still had the appearance ofsolidity and strength hereditary in his family a beard and mustachecovered the lower part of his face and a tangle of hair infested withlice curled round his head like a cap the look of his eyes wasresolute calm and animatedly alert as never before the formerslackness which had shown itself even in his eyes was now replaced by anenergetic readiness for action and resistance his feet were barepierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and horsemenwere passing that morning then into the distance across the river thenat the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about biting him andthen at his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in variouspositions moving his dirty thick big toes every time he looked at hisbare feet a smile of animated selfsatisfaction flitted across his facethe sight of them reminded him of all he had experienced and learnedduring these weeks and this recollection was pleasant to himfor some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight frosts inthe morningswhat is called an old wives summerin the sunshine the air was warm and that warmth was particularlypleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still inthe airon everythingfar and nearlay the magic crystal glitter seen only atthat time of autumn the sparrow hills were visible in the distancewith the village the church and the large white house the bare treesthe sand the bricks and roofs of the houses the green church spireand the corners of the white house in the distance all stood out in thetransparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural clearnessnear by could be seen the familiar ruins of a halfburned mansionoccupied by the french with lilac bushes still showing dark greenbeside the fence and even that ruined and befouled housewhich in dullweather was repulsively uglyseemed quietly beautiful now in theclear motionless brilliancea french corporal with coat unbuttoned in a homely way a skullcap onhis head and a short pipe in his mouth came from behind a corner ofthe shed and approached pierre with a friendly winkwhat sunshine monsieur kiril their name for pierre eh just likespringand the corporal leaned against the door and offered pierre his pipethough whenever he offered it pierre always declined itto be on the march in such weather he beganpierre inquired what was being said about leaving and the corporal toldhim that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be anorder about the prisoners that day sokolov one of the soldiers in theshed with pierre was dying and pierre told the corporal that somethingshould be done about him the corporal replied that pierre need notworry about that as they had an ambulance and a permanent hospital andarrangements would be made for the sick and that in general everythingthat could happen had been foreseen by the authoritiesbesides monsieur kiril you have only to say a word to the captainyou know he is a man who never forgets anything speak to the captainwhen he makes his round he will do anything for youthe captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with pierreand showed him all sorts of favorsyou see st thomas he said to me the other day monsieur kiril isa man of education who speaks french he is a russian seigneur who hashad misfortunes but he is a man he knows whats what if he wantsanything and asks me he wont get a refusal when one has studied yousee one likes education and wellbred people it is for your sake imention it monsieur kiril the other day if it had not been for youthat affair would have ended illand after chatting a while longer the corporal went away the affairhe had alluded to had happened a few days beforea fight between theprisoners and the french soldiers in which pierre had succeeded inpacifying his comrades some of the prisoners who had heard pierretalking to the corporal immediately asked what the frenchman had saidwhile pierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leavingmoscow a thin sallow tattered french soldier came up to the door ofthe shed rapidly and timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by wayof greeting he asked pierre whether the soldier platoche to whom he hadgiven a shirt to sew was in that sheda week before the french had had boot leather and linen issued to themwhich they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots andshirts for themready ready dear fellow said karataev coming out with a neatlyfolded shirtkarataev on account of the warm weather and for convenience at workwas wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot hishair was bound round workman fashion with a wisp of limetree bastand his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than evera promise is own brother to performance i said friday and here it isready said platon smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewnthe frenchman glanced around uneasily and then as if overcoming hishesitation rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt he had along greasy flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow thin barebody but no shirt he was evidently afraid the prisoners looking onwould laugh at him and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly noneof the prisoners said a wordsee it fits well platon kept repeating pulling the shirt straightthe frenchman having pushed his head and hands through without raisinghis eyes looked down at the shirt and examined the seamsyou see dear man this is not a sewing shop and i had no propertools and as they say one needs a tool even to kill a louse saidplaton with one of his round smiles obviously pleased with his workits good quite good thank you said the frenchman in french butthere must be some linen left overit will fit better still when it sets to your body said karataevstill admiring his handiwork youll be nice and comfortablethanks thanks old fellow but the bits left over said thefrenchman again and smiled he took out an assignation ruble note andgave it to karataev but give me the pieces that are overpierre saw that platon did not want to understand what the frenchman wassaying and he looked on without interfering karataev thanked thefrenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work the frenchmaninsisted on having the pieces returned that were left over and askedpierre to translate what he saidwhat does he want the bits for said karataev theyd make fine legbands for us well never mindand karataev with a suddenly changed and saddened expression took asmall bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to thefrenchman without looking at him oh dear muttered karataev and wentaway the frenchman looked at the linen considered for a moment thenlooked inquiringly at pierre and as if pierres look had told himsomething suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voiceplatoche eh platoche keep them yourself and handing back the oddbits he turned and went outthere look at that said karataev swaying his head people saidthey were not christians but they too have souls its what the oldfolk used to say a sweating hands an open hand a dry hands closehes naked but yet hes given it backkarataev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at thepiecesbut theyll make grand leg bands dear friend he said and went backinto the shedfour weeks had passed since pierre had been taken prisoner and thoughthe french had offered to move him from the mens to the officers shedhe had stayed in the shed where he was first putin burned and devastated moscow pierre experienced almost the extremelimits of privation a man can endure but thanks to his physicalstrength and health of which he had till then been unconscious andthanks especially to the fact that the privations came so gradually thatit was impossible to say when they began he endured his position notonly lightly but joyfully and just at this time he obtained thetranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain to reachhe had long sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind thatinner harmony which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battleof borodino he had sought it in philanthropy in freemasonry in thedissipations of town life in wine in heroic feats of selfsacrificeand in romantic love for natasha he had sought it by reasoningand allthese quests and experiments had failed him and now without thinkingabout it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through thehorror of death through privation and through what he recognized inkarataevthose dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as itwere forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitatingthoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important it did notnow occur to him to think of russia or the war or politics ornapoleon it was plain to him that all these things were no business ofhis and that he was not called on to judge concerning them andtherefore could not do so russia and summer weather are not boundtogether he thought repeating words of karataevs which he foundstrangely consoling his intention of killing napoleon and hiscalculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the apocalypse nowseemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous his anger with his wifeand anxiety that his name should not be smirched now seemed not merelytrivial but even amusing what concern was it of his that somewhere orother that woman was leading the life she preferred what did it matterto anybody and especially to him whether or not they found out thattheir prisoners name was count bezukhovhe now often remembered his conversation with prince andrew and quiteagreed with him though he understood prince andrews thoughts somewhatdifferently prince andrew had thought and said that happiness couldonly be negative but had said it with a shade of bitterness and ironyas though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness isimplanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied but pierrebelieved it without any mental reservation the absence of sufferingthe satisfaction of ones needs and consequent freedom in the choice ofones occupation that is of ones way of life now seemed to pierre tobe indubitably mans highest happiness here and now for the first timehe fully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eatdrinking when he wanted to drink sleeping when he wanted to sleep ofwarmth when he was cold of talking to a fellow man when he wished totalk and to hear a human voice the satisfaction of ones needsgoodfood cleanliness and freedomnow that he was deprived of all thisseemed to pierre to constitute perfect happiness and the choice ofoccupation that is of his way of lifenow that that was sorestrictedseemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that asuperfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying onesneeds while great freedom in the choice of occupationsuch freedom ashis wealth his education and his social position had given him in hisown lifeis just what makes the choice of occupation insolublydifficult and destroys the desire and possibility of having anoccupationall pierres daydreams now turned on the time when he would be free yetsubsequently and for the rest of his life he thought and spoke withenthusiasm of that month of captivity of those irrecoverable strongjoyful sensations and chiefly of the complete peace of mind and innerfreedom which he experienced only during those weekswhen on the first day he got up early went out of the shed at dawn andsaw the cupolas and crosses of the new convent of the virgin still darkat first the hoarfrost on the dusty grass the sparrow hills and thewooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distancewhen he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of thecrows flying from moscow across the field and when afterwards lightgleamed from the east and the suns rim appeared solemnly from behind acloud and the cupolas and crosses the hoarfrost the distance and theriver all began to sparkle in the glad lightpierre felt a new joy andstrength in life such as he had never before known and this not onlystayed with him during the whole of his imprisonment but even grew instrength as the hardships of his position increasedthat feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was stillfurther strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisonersformed of him soon after his arrival at the shed with his knowledge oflanguages the respect shown him by the french his simplicity hisreadiness to give anything asked of him he received the allowance ofthree rubles a week made to officers with his strength which heshowed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut hisgentleness to his companions and his capacity for sitting still andthinking without doing anything which seemed to them incomprehensiblehe appeared to them a rather mysterious and superior being the veryqualities that had been a hindrance if not actually harmful to him inthe world he had lived inhis strength his disdain for the comforts oflife his absentmindedness and simplicityhere among these people gavehim almost the status of a hero and pierre felt that their opinionplaced responsibilities upon himthe french evacuation began on the night between the sixth and seventhof october kitchens and sheds were dismantled carts loaded and troopsand baggage trains startedat seven in the morning a french convoy in marching trim wearing shakosand carrying muskets knapsacks and enormous sacks stood in front ofthe sheds and animated french talk mingled with curses sounded allalong the linesin the shed everyone was ready dressed belted shod and only awaitedthe order to start the sick soldier sokolov pale and thin with darkshadows round his eyes alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressedhis eyes prominent from the emaciation of his face gazed inquiringlyat his comrades who were paying no attention to him and he moanedregularly and quietly it was evidently not so much his sufferings thatcaused him to moan he had dysentery as his fear and grief at beingleft alonepierre girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes karataev hadmade for him from some leather a french soldier had torn off a tea chestand brought to have his boots mended with went up to the sick man andsquatted down beside himyou know sokolov they are not all going away they have a hospitalhere you may be better off than we others said pierreo lord oh it will be the death of me o lord moaned the man in alouder voiceill go and ask them again directly said pierre rising and going tothe door of the shedjust as pierre reached the door the corporal who had offered him a pipethe day before came up to it with two soldiers the corporal andsoldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had metalstraps and these changed their familiar facesthe corporal came according to orders to shut the door the prisonershad to be counted before being let outcorporal what will they do with the sick man pierre beganbut even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal heknew or a stranger so unlike himself did the corporal seem at thatmoment moreover just as pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drumswas suddenly heard from both sides the corporal frowned at pierreswords and uttering some meaningless oaths slammed the door the shedbecame semidark and the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides drownedthe sick mans groansthere it is it again said pierre to himself and aninvoluntary shudder ran down his spine in the corporals changed facein the sound of his voice in the stirring and deafening noise of thedrums he recognized that mysterious callous force which compelledpeople against their will to kill their fellow menthat force theeffect of which he had witnessed during the executions to fear or totry to escape that force to address entreaties or exhortations to thosewho served as its tools was useless pierre knew this now one had towait and endure he did not again go to the sick man nor turn to lookat him but stood frowning by the door of the hutwhen that door was opened and the prisoners crowding against oneanother like a flock of sheep squeezed into the exit pierre pushed hisway forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal hadassured him was ready to do anything for him the captain was also inmarching kit and on his cold face appeared that same it which pierrehad recognized in the corporals words and in the roll of the drumspass on pass on the captain reiterated frowning sternly andlooking at the prisoners who thronged past himpierre went up to him though he knew his attempt would be vainwhat now the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizingpierrepierre told him about the sick manhell manage to walk devil take him said the captain pass on passon he continued without looking at pierrebut he is dying pierre again beganbe so good shouted the captain frowning angrilydramdadadam damdam rattled the drums and pierre understoodthat this mysterious force completely controlled these men and that itwas now useless to say any morethe officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to marchin front there were about thirty officers with pierre among them andabout three hundred menthe officers who had come from the other sheds were all strangers topierre and much better dressed than he they looked at him and at hisshoes mistrustfully as at an alien not far from him walked a fat majorwith a sallow bloated angry face who was wearing a kazan dressinggown tied round with a towel and who evidently enjoyed the respect ofhis fellow prisoners he kept one hand in which he clasped his tobaccopouch inside the bosom of his dressing gown and held the stem of hispipe firmly with the other panting and puffing the major grumbled andgrowled at everybody because he thought he was being pushed and thatthey were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were allsurprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised atanother a thin little officer was speaking to everyone conjecturingwhere they were now being taken and how far they would get that day anofficial in felt boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round fromside to side and gazed at the ruins of moscow loudly announcing hisobservations as to what had been burned down and what this or that partof the city was that they could see a third officer who by his accentwas a pole disputed with the commissariat officer arguing that he wasmistaken in his identification of the different wards of moscowwhat are you disputing about said the major angrily what does itmatter whether it is st nicholas or st blasius you see its burneddown and theres an end of it what are you pushing for isnt theroad wide enough said he turning to a man behind him who was notpushing him at alloh oh oh what have they done the prisoners on one side and anotherwere heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins all beyond theriver and zubova and in the kremlin just look theres not half ofit left yes i told youthe whole quarter beyond the river and so itiswell you know its burned so whats the use of talking said themajoras they passed near a church in the khamovniki one of the few unburnedquarters of moscow the whole mass of prisoners suddenly started to oneside and exclamations of horror and disgust were heardah the villains what heathens yes dead dead so he is andsmeared with somethingpierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked theseexclamations and dimly made out something leaning against the palingssurrounding the church from the words of his comrades who saw betterthan he did he found that this was the body of a man set uprightagainst the palings with its face smeared with sootgo on what the devil go on thirty thousand devils the convoyguards began cursing and the french soldiers with fresh virulencedrove away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing atthe dead manthrough the cross streets of the khamovniki quarter the prisonersmarched followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagonsbelonging to that escort but when they reached the supply stores theycame among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled withprivate vehiclesat the bridge they all halted waiting for those in front to get acrossfrom the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving baggagetrains before and behind them to the right where the kaluga road turnsnear neskuchny endless rows of troops and carts stretched away into thedistance these were troops of beauharnais corps which had startedbefore any of the others behind along the riverside and across thestone bridge were neys troops and transportdavouts troops in whose charge were the prisoners were crossing thecrimean bridge and some were already debouching into the kaluga roadbut the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of beauharnaistrain had not yet got out of moscow and reached the kaluga road when thevanguard of neys army was already emerging from the great ordynkastreetwhen they had crossed the crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few stepsforward halted and again moved on and from all sides vehicles and mencrowded closer and closer together they advanced the few hundred pacesthat separated the bridge from the kaluga road taking more than an hourto do so and came out upon the square where the streets of thetransmoskva ward and the kaluga road converge and the prisoners jammedclose together had to stand for some hours at that crossway from allsides like the roar of the sea were heard the rattle of wheels thetramp of feet and incessant shouts of anger and abuse pierre stoodpressed against the wall of a charred house listening to that noisewhich mingled in his imagination with the roll of the drumsto get a better view several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall ofthe halfburned house against which pierre was leaningwhat crowds just look at the crowds theyve loaded goods even onthe cannon look there those are furs they exclaimed just see whatthe blackguards have looted there see what that one has behind inthe cart why those are settings taken from some icons byheaven oh the rascals see how that fellow has loaded himselfup he can hardly walk good lord theyve even grabbed thosechaises see that fellow there sitting on the trunks heavenstheyre fightingthats right hit him on the snouton his snout like this we shantget away before evening look look there why that must benapoleons own see what horses and the monograms with a crown itslike a portable house that fellows dropped his sack and doesnt seeit fighting again a woman with a baby and not badlooking eitheryes i dare say thats the way theyll let you pass just looktheres no end to it russian wenches by heaven so they are incarriagessee how comfortably theyve settled themselvesagain as at the church in khamovniki a wave of general curiosity boreall the prisoners forward onto the road and pierre thanks to hisstature saw over the heads of the others what so attracted theircuriosity in three carriages involved among the munition carts closelysqueezed together sat women with rouged faces dressed in glaringcolors who were shouting something in shrill voicesfrom the moment pierre had recognized the appearance of the mysteriousforce nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful neither the corpsesmeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the burnedruins of moscow all that he now witnessed scarcely made an impressionon himas if his soul making ready for a hard struggle refused toreceive impressions that might weaken itthe womens vehicles drove by behind them came more carts soldierswagons soldiers gun carriages carriages soldiers ammunition cartsmore soldiers and now and then womenpierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movementall these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisiblepower during the hour pierre watched them they all came flowing fromthe different streets with one and the same desire to get on quicklythey all jostled one another began to grow angry and to fight whiteteeth gleamed brows frowned ever the same words of abuse flew fromside to side and all the faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute andcoldly cruel expression that had struck pierre that morning on thecorporals face when the drums were beatingit was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the escortcollected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way in amongthe baggage trains and the prisoners hemmed in on all sides emergedonto the kaluga roadthey marched very quickly without resting and halted only when the sunbegan to set the baggage carts drew up close together and the men beganto prepare for their nights rest they all appeared angry anddissatisfied for a long time oaths angry shouts and fighting couldbe heard from all sides a carriage that followed the escort ran intoone of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole severalsoldiers ran toward the cart from different sides some beat thecarriage horses on their heads turning them aside others fought amongthemselves and pierre saw that one german was badly wounded on the headby a swordit seemed that all these men now that they had stopped amid fields inthe chill dusk of the autumn evening experienced one and the samefeeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push onthat had seized them at the start once at a standstill they all seemedto understand that they did not yet know where they were going and thatmuch that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journeyduring this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than theyhad done at the start it was here that the prisoners for the first timereceived horseflesh for their meat rationfrom the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed likepersonal spite against each of the prisoners in unexpected contrast totheir former friendly relationsthis spite increased still more when on calling over the roll ofprisoners it was found that in the bustle of leaving moscow one russiansoldier who had pretended to suffer from colic had escaped pierre sawa frenchman beat a russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from theroad and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten to courtmartial a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of therussian to the noncommissioned officers excuse that the prisoner wasill and could not walk the officer replied that the order was to shootthose who lagged behind pierre felt that that fatal force which hadcrushed him during the executions but which he had not felt during hisimprisonment now again controlled his existence it was terrible buthe felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crushhim there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independentof ithe ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with hiscomradesneither pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen inmoscow or of the roughness of their treatment by the french or of theorder to shoot them which had been announced to them as if in reactionagainst the worsening of their position they were all particularlyanimated and gay they spoke of personal reminiscences of amusingscenes they had witnessed during the campaign and avoided all talk oftheir present situationthe sun had set long since bright stars shone out here and there in thesky a red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from therising full moon and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the grayhaze it grew light the evening was ending but the night had not yetcome pierre got up and left his new companions crossing between thecampfires to the other side of the road where he had been told thecommon soldier prisoners were stationed he wanted to talk to them onthe road he was stopped by a french sentinel who ordered him backpierre turned back not to his companions by the campfire but to anunharnessed cart where there was nobody tucking his legs under him anddropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of thecart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought suddenly heburst out into a fit of his broad goodnatured laughter so loud thatmen from various sides turned with surprise to see what this strange andevidently solitary laughter could meanhahaha laughed pierre and he said aloud to himself the soldierdid not let me pass they took me and shut me up they hold me captivewhat me me my immortal soul hahaha hahaha and he laughedtill tears started to his eyesa man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing atall by himself pierre stopped laughing got up went farther away fromthe inquisitive man and looked around himthe huge endless bivouac that had previously resounded with thecrackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet thered campfires were growing paler and dying down high up in the lightsky hung the full moon forests and fields beyond the camp unseenbefore were now visible in the distance and farther still beyondthose forests and fields the bright oscillating limitless distancelured one to itself pierre glanced up at the sky and the twinklingstars in its faraway depths and all that is me all that is within meand it is all i thought pierre and they caught all that and put itinto a shed boarded up with planks he smiled and went and lay down tosleep beside his companionsin the early days of october another envoy came to kutuzov with a letterfrom napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from moscow thoughnapoleon was already not far from kutuzov on the old kaluga roadkutuzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerlybrought by lauriston saying that there could be no question of peacesoon after that a report was received from dorokhovs guerrilladetachment operating to the left of tarutino that troops of broussiersdivision had been seen at forminsk and that being separated from therest of the french army they might easily be destroyed the soldiers andofficers again demanded action generals on the staff excited by thememory of the easy victory at tarutino urged kutuzov to carry outdorokhovs suggestion kutuzov did not consider any offensive necessarythe result was a compromise which was inevitable a small detachment wassent to forminsk to attack broussierby a strange coincidence this task which turned out to be a mostdifficult and important one was entrusted to dokhturovthat samemodest little dokhturov whom no one had described to us as drawing upplans of battles dashing about in front of regiments showering crosseson batteries and so on and who was thought to be and was spoken of asundecided and undiscerningbut whom we find commanding wherever theposition was most difficult all through the russofrench wars fromausterlitz to the year  at austerlitz he remained last at theaugezd dam rallying the regiments saving what was possible when allwere flying and perishing and not a single general was left in the rearguard ill with fever he went to smolensk with twenty thousand men todefend the town against napoleons whole army in smolensk at themalakhov gate he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before hewas awakened by the bombardment of the townand smolensk held out allday long at the battle of borodino when bagration was killed and ninetenths of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of thefrench artillery fire was directed against it the man sent there wasthis same irresolute and undiscerning dokhturovkutuzov hastening torectify a mistake he had made by sending someone else there first andthe quiet little dokhturov rode thither and borodino became thegreatest glory of the russian army many heroes have been described tous in verse and prose but of dokhturov scarcely a word has been saidit was dokhturov again whom they sent to forminsk and from there tomaloyaroslavets the place where the last battle with the french wasfought and where the obvious disintegration of the french army beganand we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of thecampaign but of dokhturov nothing or very little is said and thatdubiously and this silence about dokhturov is the clearest testimony tohis meritit is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of amachine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance andis interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its mostimportant part the man who does not understand the construction of themachine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel whichrevolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine andnot the shaving which merely harms and hinders the workingon the tenth of october when dokhturov had gone halfway to forminsk andstopped at the village of aristovo preparing faithfully to execute theorders he had received the whole french army having in its convulsivemovement reached murats position apparently in order to give battlesuddenly without any reason turned off to the left onto the new kalugaroad and began to enter forminsk where only broussier had been tillthen at that time dokhturov had under his command besides dorokhovsdetachment the two small guerrilla detachments of figner and seslavinon the evening of october  seslavin came to the aristovo headquarterswith a french guardsman he had captured the prisoner said that thetroops that had entered forminsk that day were the vanguard of the wholearmy that napoleon was there and the whole army had left moscow fourdays previously that same evening a house serf who had come fromborovsk said he had seen an immense army entering the town somecossacks of dokhturovs detachment reported having sighted the frenchguards marching along the road to borovsk from all these reports it wasevident that where they had expected to meet a single division there wasnow the whole french army marching from moscow in an unexpecteddirectionalong the kaluga road dokhturov was unwilling to undertakeany action as it was not clear to him now what he ought to do he hadbeen ordered to attack forminsk but only broussier had been there atthat time and now the whole french army was there ermolov wished to acton his own judgment but dokhturov insisted that he must have kutuzovsinstructions so it was decided to send a dispatch to the stafffor this purpose a capable officer bolkhovitinov was chosen who wasto explain the whole affair by word of mouth besides delivering awritten report toward midnight bolkhovitinov having received thedispatch and verbal instructions galloped off to the general staffaccompanied by a cossack with spare horsesit was a warm dark autumn night it had been raining for four dayshaving changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and ahalf over a sticky muddy road bolkhovitinov reached litashevka afterone oclock at night dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fencehung a signboard general staff and throwing down his reins he entereda dark passagethe general on duty quick its very important said he to someonewho had risen and was sniffing in the dark passagehe has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third nighthe has not slept said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper you shouldwake the captain firstbut this is very important from general dokhturov saidbolkhovitinov entering the open door which he had found by feeling inthe darkthe orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebodyyour honor your honor a courierwhat whats that from whom came a sleepy voicefrom dokhturov and from alexey petrovich napoleon is at forminsksaid bolkhovitinov unable to see in the dark who was speaking butguessing by the voice that it was not konovnitsynthe man who had wakened yawned and stretched himselfi dont like waking him he said fumbling for something he is veryill perhaps this is only a rumorhere is the dispatch said bolkhovitinov my orders are to give it atonce to the general on dutywait a moment ill light a candle you damned rascal where do youalways hide it said the voice of the man who was stretching himselfto the orderly this was shcherbinin konovnitsyns adjutant ivefound it ive found it he addedthe orderly was striking a light and shcherbinin was fumbling forsomething on the candlestickoh the nasty beasts said he with disgustby the light of the sparks bolkhovitinov saw shcherbinins youthful faceas he held the candle and the face of another man who was still asleepthis was konovnitsynwhen the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned upfirst blue and then red shcherbinin lit the tallow candle from thecandlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it wererunning away and looked at the messenger bolkhovitinov was bespatteredall over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it with his sleevewho gave the report inquired shcherbinin taking the envelopethe news is reliable said bolkhovitinov prisoners cossacks andthe scouts all say the same thingtheres nothing to be done well have to wake him said shcherbininrising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay covered by agreatcoat peter petrovich said he konovnitsyn did not stir tothe general staff he said with a smile knowing that those words wouldbe sure to arouse himand in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once onkonovnitsyns handsome resolute face with cheeks flushed by feverthere still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remotefrom present affairs but then he suddenly started and his face assumedits habitual calm and firm appearancewell what is it from whom he asked immediately but without hurryblinking at the lightwhile listening to the officers report konovnitsyn broke the seal andread the dispatch hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs intheir woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on hisboots then he took off his nightcap combed his hair over his templesand donned his capdid you get here quickly let us go to his highnesskonovnitsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of greatimportance and that no time must be lost he did not consider or askhimself whether the news was good or bad that did not interest him heregarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or hisreason but by something else there was within him a deep unexpressedconviction that all would be well but that one must not trust to thisand still less speak about it but must only attend to ones own workand he did his work giving his whole strength to the taskpeter petrovich konovnitsyn like dokhturov seems to have been includedmerely for proprietys sake in the list of the socalled heroes of the barclays raevskis ermolovs platovs and miloradoviches likedokhturov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited capacityand information and like dokhturov he never made plans of battle butwas always found where the situation was most difficult since hisappointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door opengiving orders that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up inbattle he was always under fire so that kutuzov reproved him for it andfeared to send him to the front and like dokhturov he was one of thoseunnoticed cogwheels that without clatter or noise constitute the mostessential part of the machinecoming out of the hut into the damp dark night konovnitsyn frownedpartly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the unpleasantthought that occurred to him of how all that nest of influential men onthe staff would be stirred up by this news especially bennigsen whoever since tarutino had been at daggers drawn with kutuzov and how theywould make suggestions quarrel issue orders and rescind them andthis premonition was disagreeable to him though he knew it could not behelpedand in fact toll to whom he went to communicate the news immediatelybegan to expound his plans to a general sharing his quarters untilkonovnitsyn who listened in weary silence reminded him that they mustgo to see his highnesskutuzov like all old people did not sleep much at night he often fellasleep unexpectedly in the daytime but at night lying on his bedwithout undressing he generally remained awake thinkingso he lay now on his bed supporting his large heavy scarred head onhis plump hand with his one eye open meditating and peering into thedarknesssince bennigsen who corresponded with the emperor and had moreinfluence than anyone else on the staff had begun to avoid him kutuzovwas more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops beingobliged to take part in useless aggressive movements the lesson of thetarutino battle and of the day before it which kutuzov remembered withpain must he thought have some effect on others toothey must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensivepatience and time are my warriors my champions thought kutuzov heknew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green it will fallof itself when ripe but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled the treeis harmed and your teeth are set on edge like an experienced sportsmanhe knew that the beast was wounded and wounded as only the wholestrength of russia could have wounded it but whether it was mortallywounded or not was still an undecided question now by the fact oflauriston and barthelemi having been sent and by the reports of theguerrillas kutuzov was almost sure that the wound was mortal but heneeded further proofs and it was necessary to waitthey want to run to see how they have wounded it wait and we shallsee continual maneuvers continual advances thought he what foronly to distinguish themselves as if fighting were fun they are likechildren from whom one cant get any sensible account of what hashappened because they all want to show how well they can fight butthats not what is needed nowand what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me it seems to themthat when they have thought of two or three contingencies heremembered the general plan sent him from petersburg they haveforeseen everything but the contingencies are endlessthe undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at borodino wasmortal or not had hung over kutuzovs head for a whole month on the onehand the french had occupied moscow on the other kutuzov felt assuredwith all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all therussians had put their whole strength must have been mortal but in anycase proofs were needed he had waited a whole month for them and grewmore impatient the longer he waited lying on his bed during thosesleepless nights he did just what he reproached those younger generalsfor doing he imagined all sorts of possible contingencies just likethe younger men but with this difference that he saw thousands ofcontingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them thelonger he thought the more contingencies presented themselves heimagined all sorts of movements of the napoleonic army as a whole or insectionsagainst petersburg or against him or to outflank him hethought too of the possibility which he feared most of all thatnapoleon might fight him with his own weapon and remain in moscowawaiting him kutuzov even imagined that napoleons army might turn backthrough medyn and yukhnov but the one thing he could not foresee waswhat happenedthe insane convulsive stampede of napoleons army duringits first eleven days after leaving moscow a stampede which madepossible what kutuzov had not yet even dared to think ofthe completeextermination of the french dorokhovs report about broussiersdivision the guerrillas reports of distress in napoleons army rumorsof preparations for leaving moscow all confirmed the supposition thatthe french army was beaten and preparing for flight but these were onlysuppositions which seemed important to the younger men but not tokutuzov with his sixty years experience he knew what value to attachto rumors knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all newsso that it appears to confirm what they desire and he knew how readilyin such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary and the more hedesired it the less he allowed himself to believe it this questionabsorbed all his mental powers all else was to him only lifescustomary routine to such customary routine belonged his conversationswith the staff the letters he wrote from tarutino to madame de staelthe reading of novels the distribution of awards his correspondencewith petersburg and so on but the destruction of the french which healone foresaw was his hearts one desireon the night of the eleventh of october he lay leaning on his arm andthinking of thatthere was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of tollkonovnitsyn and bolkhovitinoveh whos there come in come in what news the field marshal calledout to themwhile a footman was lighting a candle toll communicated the substanceof the newswho brought it asked kutuzov with a look which when the candle waslit struck toll by its cold severitythere can be no doubt about it your highnesscall him in call him herekutuzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big paunchresting against the other which was doubled under him he screwed up hisseeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully as if wishing toread in his face what preoccupied his own mindtell me tell me friend said he to bolkhovitinov in his low agedvoice as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his chestcome nearernearer what news have you brought me eh that napoleonhas left moscow are you sure ehbolkhovitinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he hadbeen told to reportspeak quicker quicker dont torture me kutuzov interrupted himbolkhovitinov told him everything and was then silent awaitinginstructions toll was beginning to say something but kutuzov checkedhim he tried to say something but his face suddenly puckered andwrinkled he waved his arm at toll and turned to the opposite side ofthe room to the corner darkened by the icons that hung thereo lord my creator thou has heard our prayer said he in atremulous voice with folded hands russia is saved i thank thee olord and he weptfrom the time he received this news to the end of the campaign allkutuzovs activity was directed toward restraining his troops byauthority by guile and by entreaty from useless attacks maneuversor encounters with the perishing enemy dokhturov went to maloyaroslavets but kutuzov lingered with the main army and gave orders forthe evacuation of kalugaa retreat beyond which town seemed to himquite possibleeverywhere kutuzov retreated but the enemy without waiting for hisretreat fled in the opposite directionnapoleons historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at tarutinoand maloyaroslavets and make conjectures as to what would havehappened had napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich southernprovincesbut not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from advancinginto those southern provinces for the russian army did not bar hisway the historians forget that nothing could have saved his army forthen already it bore within itself the germs of inevitable ruin howcould that armywhich had found abundant supplies in moscow and hadtrampled them underfoot instead of keeping them and on arriving atsmolensk had looted provisions instead of storing themhow could thatarmy recuperate in kaluga province which was inhabited by russians suchas those who lived in moscow and where fire had the same property ofconsuming what was set ablazethat army could not recover anywhere since the battle of borodino andthe pillage of moscow it had borne within itself as it were thechemical elements of dissolutionthe members of what had once been an armynapoleon himself and all hissoldiers fledwithout knowing whither each concerned only to make hisescape as quickly as possible from this position of the hopelessness ofwhich they were all more or less vaguely consciousso it came about that at the council at maloyaroslavets when thegenerals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions allmouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simpleminded soldiermouton who speaking last said what they all felt that the one thingneedful was to get away as quickly as possible and no one not evennapoleon could say anything against that truth which they allrecognizedbut though they all realized that it was necessary to get away therestill remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee anexternal shock was needed to overcome that shame and this shock came indue time it was what the french called le hourra de lempereurthe day after the council at maloyaroslavets napoleon rode out early inthe morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and anescort on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of theprevious and of the impending battle some cossacks on the prowl forbooty fell in with the emperor and very nearly captured him if thecossacks did not capture napoleon then what saved him was the verything that was destroying the french army the booty on which thecossacks fell here as at tarutino they went after plunder leaving themen disregarding napoleon they rushed after the plunder and napoleonmanaged to escapewhen les enfants du don might so easily have taken the emperor himselfin the midst of his army it was clear that there was nothing for it butto fly as fast as possible along the nearest familiar road napoleonwith his fortyyearold stomach understood that hint not feeling hisformer agility and boldness and under the influence of the fright thecossacks had given him he at once agreed with mouton and issued ordersas the historians tell usto retreat by the smolensk roadthat napoleon agreed with mouton and that the army retreated does notprove that napoleon caused it to retreat but that the forces whichinfluenced the whole army and directed it along the mozhaysk that isthe smolensk road acted simultaneously on him alsoa man in motion always devises an aim for that motion to be able to goa thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at theend of those thousand miles one must have the prospect of a promisedland to have the strength to movethe promised land for the french during their advance had been moscowduring their retreat it was their native land but that native land wastoo far off and for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutelynecessary to set aside his final goal and to say to himself today ishall get to a place twentyfive miles off where i shall rest and spendthe night and during the first days journey that resting placeeclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his hopes and desires andthe impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowdfor the french retreating along the old smolensk road the final goaltheir native landwas too remote and their immediate goal wassmolensk toward which all their desires and hopes enormouslyintensified in the mass urged them on it was not that they knew thatmuch food and fresh troops awaited them in smolensk nor that they weretold so on the contrary their superior officers and napoleon himselfknew that provisions were scarce there but because this alone couldgive them strength to move on and endure their present privations soboth those who knew and those who did not know deceived themselves andpushed on to smolensk as to a promised landcoming out onto the highroad the french fled with surprising energy andunheardof rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on besides thecommon impulse which bound the whole crowd of french into one mass andsupplied them with a certain energy there was another cause bindingthem togethertheir great numbers as with the physical law of gravitytheir enormous mass drew the individual human atoms to itself in theirhundreds of thousands they moved like a whole nationeach of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a prisonerto escape from all this horror and misery but on the one hand the forceof this common attraction to smolensk their goal drew each of them inthe same direction on the other hand an army corps could not surrenderto a company and though the french availed themselves of everyconvenient opportunity to detach themselves and to surrender on theslightest decent pretext such pretexts did not always occur their verynumbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of thatpossibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for therussians to stop this movement to which the french were directing alltheir energies beyond a certain limit no mechanical disruption of thebody could hasten the process of decompositiona lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously there is a certainlimit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow onthe contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the remaining snowbecomesof the russian commanders kutuzov alone understood this when the flightof the french army along the smolensk road became well defined whatkonovnitsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of october beganto occur the superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves tocut off to seize to capture and to overthrow the french and allclamored for actionkutuzov alone used all his power and such power is very limited in thecase of any commanderinchief to prevent an attackhe could not tell them what we say now why fight why block the roadlosing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches whatis the use of that when a third of their army has melted away on theroad from moscow to vyazma without any battle but drawing from hisaged wisdom what they could understand he told them of the goldenbridge and they laughed at and slandered him flinging themselves onrending and exulting over the dying beastermolov miloradovich platov and others in proximity to the frenchnear vyazma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up twofrench corps and by way of reporting their intention to kutuzov theysent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelopeand try as kutuzov might to restrain the troops our men attackedtrying to bar the road infantry regiments we are told advanced to theattack with music and with drums beating and killed and lost thousandsof menbut they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the french armyclosing up more firmly at the danger continued while steadily meltingaway to pursue its fatal path to smolenskthe battle of borodino with the occupation of moscow that followed itand the flight of the french without further conflicts is one of themost instructive phenomena in historyall historians agree that the external activity of states and nations intheir conflicts with one another is expressed in wars and that as adirect result of greater or less success in war the political strengthof states and nations increases or decreasesstrange as may be the historical account of how some king or emperorhaving quarreled with another collects an army fights his enemysarmy gains a victory by killing three five or ten thousand men andsubjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions all thefacts of history as far as we know it confirm the truth of thestatement that the greater or lesser success of one army against anotheris the cause or at least an essential indication of an increase ordecrease in the strength of the nationeven though it is unintelligiblewhy the defeat of an armya hundredth part of a nationshould obligethat whole nation to submit an army gains a victory and at once therights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of thedefeated an army has suffered defeat and at once a people loses itsrights in proportion to the severity of the reverse and if its armysuffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugatedso according to history it has been found from the most ancient timesand so it is to our own day all napoleons wars serve to confirm thisrule in proportion to the defeat of the austrian army austria loses itsrights and the rights and the strength of france increase thevictories of the french at jena and auerstadt destroy the independentexistence of prussiabut then in  the french gain a victory near moscow moscow istaken and after that with no further battles it is not russia thatceases to exist but the french army of six hundred thousand and thennapoleonic france itself to strain the facts to fit the rules ofhistory to say that the field of battle at borodino remained in thehands of the russians or that after moscow there were other battlesthat destroyed napoleons army is impossibleafter the french victory at borodino there was no general engagement norany that were at all serious yet the french army ceased to exist whatdoes this mean if it were an example taken from the history of chinawe might say that it was not an historic phenomenon which is thehistorians usual expedient when anything does not fit their standardsif the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small numberof troops took part we might treat it as an exception but this eventoccurred before our fathers eyes and for them it was a question of thelife or death of their fatherland and it happened in the greatest ofall known warsthe period of the campaign of  from the battle of borodino to theexpulsion of the french proved that the winning of a battle does notproduce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquestit proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not inthe conquerors nor even in armies and battles but in something elsethe french historians describing the condition of the french armybefore it left moscow affirm that all was in order in the grand armyexcept the cavalry the artillery and the transportthere was noforage for the horses or the cattle that was a misfortune no one couldremedy for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather thanlet the french have itthe victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasantskarp and vlas who after the french had evacuated moscow drove in theircarts to pillage the town and in general personally failed to manifestany heroic feelings and the whole innumerable multitude of suchpeasants did not bring their hay to moscow for the high price offeredthem but burned it insteadlet us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiersaccording to all the rules of the art of fencing the fencing has goneon for some time suddenly one of the combatants feeling himselfwounded and understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns hislife throws down his rapier and seizing the first cudgel that comes tohand begins to brandish it then let us imagine that the combatant whoso sensibly employed the best and simplest means to attain his end wasat the same time influenced by traditions of chivalry and desiring toconceal the facts of the case insisted that he had gained his victorywith the rapier according to all the rules of art one can imagine whatconfusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duelthe fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing wasthe french army his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched upthe cudgel was the russian people those who try to explain the matteraccording to the rules of fencing are the historians who have describedthe eventafter the burning of smolensk a war began which did not follow anyprevious traditions of war the burning of towns and villages theretreats after battles the blow dealt at borodino and the renewedretreat the burning of moscow the capture of marauders the seizure oftransports and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rulesnapoleon felt this and from the time he took up the correct fencingattitude in moscow and instead of his opponents rapier saw a cudgelraised above his head he did not cease to complain to kutuzov and tothe emperor alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to allthe rulesas if there were any rules for killing people in spite ofthe complaints of the french as to the nonobservance of the rules inspite of the fact that to some highly placed russians it seemed ratherdisgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pose enquarte or en tierce according to all the rules and to make an adroitthrust en prime and so onthe cudgel of the peoples war was liftedwith all its menacing and majestic strength and without consultinganyones tastes or rules and regardless of anything else it rose andfell with stupid simplicity but consistently and belabored the frenchtill the whole invasion had perishedand it is well for a people who do notas the french did in salute according to all the rules of art and presenting the hilt oftheir rapier gracefully and politely hand it to their magnanimousconqueror but at the moment of trial without asking what rules othershave adopted in similar cases simply and easily pick up the firstcudgel that comes to hand and strike with it till the feeling ofresentment and revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of contempt andcompassionone of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the socalledlaws of war is the action of scattered groups against men pressedtogether in a mass such action always occurs in wars that take on anational character in such actions instead of two crowds opposing eachother the men disperse attack singly run away when attacked bystronger forces but again attack when opportunity offers this was doneby the guerrillas in spain by the mountain tribes in the caucasus andby the russians in people have called this kind of war guerrilla warfare and assume thatby so calling it they have explained its meaning but such a war doesnot fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a wellknown ruleof tactics which is accepted as infallible that rule says that anattacker should concentrate his forces in order to be stronger than hisopponent at the moment of conflictguerrilla war always successful as history shows directly infringesthat rulethis contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumesthe strength of an army to be identical with its numbers militaryscience says that the more troops the greater the strength les grosbataillons ont toujours raison  large battalions are always victoriousfor military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanicsby reference to the mass only stating that momenta are equal or unequalto each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequalmomentum quantity of motion is the product of mass and velocityin military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its massand some unknown xmilitary science seeing in history innumerable instances of the factthat the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and thatsmall detachments defeat larger ones obscurely admits the existence ofthis unknown factor and tries to discover itnow in a geometricformation now in the equipment employed now and most usually in thegenius of the commanders but the assignment of these various meaningsto the factor does not yield results which accord with the historicfactsyet it is only necessary to abandon the false view adopted to gratifythe heroes of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime bycommanders in order to find this unknown quantitythat unknown quantity is the spirit of the army that is to say thegreater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the mencomposing an army quite independently of whether they are or are notfighting under the command of a genius in twoor threeline formationwith cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute men whowant to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageousconditions for fightingthe spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass givesthe resulting force to define and express the significance of thisunknown factorthe spirit of an armyis a problem for sciencethis problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute forthe unknown x itself the conditions under which that force becomesapparentsuch as the commands of the general the equipment employedand so onmistaking these for the real significance of the factor andif we recognize this unknown quantity in its entirety as being thegreater or lesser desire to fight and to face danger only thenexpressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relativesignificance of this factor can we hope to define the unknownten men battalions or divisions fighting fifteen men battalions ordivisions conquerthat is kill or take captiveall the others whilethemselves losing four so that on the one side four and on the otherfifteen were lost consequently the four were equal to the fifteen andtherefore x  y consequently xy   this equation does not giveus the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio between twounknowns and by bringing variously selected historic units battlescampaigns periods of war into such equations a series of numberscould be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might bediscoveredthe tactical rule that an army should act in masses when attacking andin smaller groups in retreat unconsciously confirms the truth that thestrength of an army depends on its spirit to lead men forward underfire more discipline obtainable only by movement in masses is neededthan is needed to resist attacks but this rule which leaves out ofaccount the spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is inparticularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise orfall in the spirit of the troops occurs as in all national warsthe french retreating in though according to tactics they shouldhave separated into detachments to defend themselvescongregated into amass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the massheld the army together the russians on the contrary ought accordingto tactics to have attacked in mass but in fact they split up intosmall units because their spirit had so risen that separateindividuals without orders dealt blows at the french without needingany compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships anddangersthe socalled partisan war began with the entry of the french intosmolenskbefore partisan warfare had been officially recognized by thegovernment thousands of enemy stragglers marauders and foragers hadbeen destroyed by the cossacks and the peasants who killed them off asinstinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death denis davydovwith his russian instinct was the first to recognize the value of thisterrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of military sciencedestroyed the french and to him belongs the credit for taking the firststep toward regularizing this method of warfareon august  davydovs first partisan detachment was formed and thenothers were recognized the further the campaign progressed the morenumerous these detachments becamethe irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal they gathered thefallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered treethefrench armyand sometimes shook that tree itself by october when thefrench were fleeing toward smolensk there were hundreds of suchcompanies of various sizes and characters there were some that adoptedall the army methods and had infantry artillery staffs and thecomforts of life others consisted solely of cossack cavalry there werealso small scratch groups of foot and horse and groups of peasants andlandowners that remained unknown a sacristan commanded one party whichcaptured several hundred prisoners in the course of a month and therewas vasilisa the wife of a village elder who slew hundreds of thefrenchthe partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days ofoctober its first period had passed when the partisans themselvesamazed at their own boldness feared every minute to be surrounded andcaptured by the french and hid in the forests without unsaddlinghardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued by the endof october this kind of warfare had taken definite shape it had becomeclear to all what could be ventured against the french and what couldnot now only the commanders of detachments with staffs and movingaccording to rules at a distance from the french still regarded manythings as impossible the small bands that had started their activitieslong before and had already observed the french closely consideredthings possible which the commanders of the big detachments did not dareto contemplate the cossacks and peasants who crept in among the frenchnow considered everything possibleon october  denisov who was one of the irregulars was with hisgroup at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm since early morning heand his party had been on the move all day long he had been watchingfrom the forest that skirted the highroad a large french convoy ofcavalry baggage and russian prisoners separated from the rest of thearmy whichas was learned from spies and prisonerswas moving under astrong escort to smolensk besides denisov and dolokhov who also led asmall party and moved in denisovs vicinity the commanders of somelarge divisions with staffs also knew of this convoy and as denisovexpressed it were sharpening their teeth for it two of the commandersof large partiesone a pole and the other a germansent invitations todenisov almost simultaneously requesting him to join up with theirdivisions to attack the convoyno bwother i have gwown mustaches myself said denisov on readingthese documents and he wrote to the german that despite his heartfeltdesire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general he had to forgothat pleasure because he was already under the command of the polishgeneral to the polish general he replied to the same effect informinghim that he was already under the command of the germanhaving arranged matters thus denisov and dolokhov intended withoutreporting matters to the higher command to attack and seize that convoywith their own small forces on october  it was moving from thevillage of mikulino to that of shamshevo to the left of the roadbetween mikulino and shamshevo there were large forests extending insome places up to the road itself though in others a mile or more backfrom it through these forests denisov and his party rode all daysometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to the veryedge but never losing sight of the moving french that morningcossacks of denisovs party had seized and carried off into the foresttwo wagons loaded with cavalry saddles which had stuck in the mud notfar from mikulino where the forest ran close to the road since thenand until evening the party had watched the movements of the frenchwithout attacking it was necessary to let the french reach shamshevoquietly without alarming them and then after joining dolokhov who wasto come that evening to a consultation at a watchmans hut in the forestless than a mile from shamshevo to surprise the french at dawn fallinglike an avalanche on their heads from two sides and rout and capturethem all at one blowin their rear more than a mile from mikulino where the forest cameright up to the road six cossacks were posted to report if any freshcolumns of french should show themselvesbeyond shamshevo dolokhov was to observe the road in the same way tofind out at what distance there were other french troops they reckonedthat the convoy had fifteen hundred men denisov had two hundred anddolokhov might have as many more but the disparity of numbers did notdeter denisov all that he now wanted to know was what troops these wereand to learn that he had to capture a tonguethat is a man from theenemy column that mornings attack on the wagons had been made sohastily that the frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed only alittle drummer boy had been taken alive and as he was a straggler hecould tell them nothing definite about the troops in that columndenisov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear ofputting the whole column on the alert so he sent tikhon shcherbaty apeasant of his party to shamshevo to try and seize at least one of thefrench quartermasters who had been sent on in advanceit was a warm rainy autumn day the sky and the horizon were both thecolor of muddy water at times a sort of mist descended and thensuddenly heavy slanting rain came downdenisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran downwas riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides like his horsewhich turned its head and laid its ears back he shrank from the drivingrain and gazed anxiously before him his thin face with its short thickblack beard looked angrybeside denisov rode an esaul  denisovs fellow worker also in feltcloak and sheepskin cap and riding a large sleek don horse a captain of cossacksesaul lovayski the third was a tall man as straight as an arrow palefaced fairhaired with narrow light eyes and with calm selfsatisfaction in his face and bearing though it was impossible to say inwhat the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay yet at first glance atthe esaul and denisov one saw that the latter was wet and uncomfortableand was a man mounted on a horse while looking at the esaul one sawthat he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always and that he wasnot a man who had mounted a horse but a man who was one with his horsea being consequently possessed of twofold strengtha little ahead of them walked a peasant guide wet to the skin andwearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted capa little behind on a poor small lean kirghiz mount with an enormoustail and mane and a bleeding mouth rode a young officer in a bluefrench overcoatbeside him rode an hussar with a boy in a tattered french uniform andblue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse the boy held on to thehussar with cold red hands and raising his eyebrows gazed about himwith surprise this was the french drummer boy captured that morningbehind them along the narrow sodden cutup forest road came hussars inthrees and fours and then cossacks some in felt cloaks some in frenchgreatcoats and some with horsecloths over their heads the horsesbeing drenched by the rain all looked black whether chestnut or baytheir necks with their wet closeclinging manes looked strangelythin steam rose from them clothes saddles reins were all wetslippery and sodden like the ground and the fallen leaves that strewedthe road the men sat huddled up trying not to stir so as to warm thewater that had trickled to their bodies and not admit the fresh coldwater that was leaking in under their seats their knees and at theback of their necks in the midst of the outspread line of cossacks twowagons drawn by french horses and by saddled cossack horses that hadbeen hitched on in front rumbled over the tree stumps and branches andsplashed through the water that lay in the rutsdenisovs horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumpedhis riders knee against a treeoh the devil exclaimed denisov angrily and showing his teeth hestruck his horse three times with his whip splashing himself and hiscomrades with muddenisov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hungernone of them had eaten anything since morning and yet more because hestill had no news from dolokhov and the man sent to capture a tonguehad not returnedtherell hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as todayits too risky to attack them by oneself and if we put it off tillanother day one of the big guerrilla detachments will snatch the preyfrom under our noses thought denisov continually peering forwardhoping to see a messenger from dolokhovon coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to theright denisov stoppedtheres someone coming said hethe esaul looked in the direction denisov indicatedthere are two an officer and a cossack but it is not presupposablethat it is the lieutenant colonel himself said the esaul who was fondof using words the cossacks did not knowthe approaching riders having descended a decline were no longervisible but they reappeared a few minutes later in front at a wearygallop and using his leather whip rode an officer disheveled anddrenched whose trousers had worked up to above his knees behind himstanding in the stirrups trotted a cossack the officer a very younglad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes galloped up to denisovand handed him a sodden envelopefrom the general said the officer please excuse its not being quitedrydenisov frowning took the envelope and opened itthere they kept telling us its dangerous its dangerous saidthe officer addressing the esaul while denisov was reading thedispatch but komarov and ihe pointed to the cossackwereprepared we have each of us two pistols but whats this he askednoticing the french drummer boy a prisoner youve already been inaction may i speak to himwostov petya exclaimed denisov having run through the dispatchwhy didnt you say who you were and turning with a smile he held outhis hand to the ladthe officer was petya rostovall the way petya had been preparing himself to behave with denisov asbefitted a grownup man and an officerwithout hinting at their previousacquaintance but as soon as denisov smiled at him petya brightened upblushed with pleasure forgot the official manner he had beenrehearsing and began telling him how he had already been in a battlenear vyazma and how a certain hussar had distinguished himself therewell i am glad to see you denisov interrupted him and his faceagain assumed its anxious expressionmichael feoklitych said he to the esaul this is again fwom thatgerman you know hehe indicated petyais serving under himand denisov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was arepetition of the german generals demand that he should join forceswith him for an attack on the transportif we dont take it tomowwow hell snatch it fwom under our noses headdedwhile denisov was talking to the esaul petyaabashed by denisovs coldtone and supposing that it was due to the condition of his trousersfurtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat so that no oneshould notice it while maintaining as martial an air as possiblewill there be any orders your honor he asked denisov holding hishand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general forwhich he had prepared himself or shall i remain with your honororders denisov repeated thoughtfully but can you stay tilltomowwowoh please may i stay with you cried petyabut just what did the genewal tell you to weturn at once askeddenisovpetya blushedhe gave me no instructions i think i could he returned inquiringlywell all wight said denisovand turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting placearranged near the watchmans hut in the forest and told the officer onthe kirghiz horse who performed the duties of an adjutant to go andfind out where dolokhov was and whether he would come that eveningdenisov himself intended going with the esaul and petya to the edge ofthe forest where it reached out to shamshevo to have a look at the partof the french bivouac they were to attack next daywell old fellow said he to the peasant guide lead us toshamshevodenisov petya and the esaul accompanied by some cossacks and thehussar who had the prisoner rode to the left across a ravine to theedge of the forestthe rain had stopped and only the mist was falling and drops from thetrees denisov the esaul and petya rode silently following thepeasant in the knitted cap who stepping lightly with outturned toes andmoving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leavessilently led them to the edge of the foresthe ascended an incline stopped looked about him and advanced to wherethe screen of trees was less dense on reaching a large oak tree thathad not yet shed its leaves he stopped and beckoned mysteriously tothem with his handdenisov and petya rode up to him from the spot where the peasant wasstanding they could see the french immediately beyond the forest on adownward slope lay a field of spring rye to the right beyond a steepravine was a small village and a landowners house with a broken roofin the village in the house in the garden by the well by the pondover all the rising ground and all along the road uphill from thebridge leading to the village not more than five hundred yards awaycrowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist their unrussian shouting at their horses which were straining uphill with thecarts and their calls to one another could be clearly heardbwing the prisoner here said denisov in a low voice not taking hiseyes off the frencha cossack dismounted lifted the boy down and took him to denisovpointing to the french troops denisov asked him what these and those ofthem were the boy thrusting his cold hands into his pockets andlifting his eyebrows looked at denisov in affright but in spite of anevident desire to say all he knew gave confused answers merelyassenting to everything denisov asked him denisov turned away from himfrowning and addressed the esaul conveying his own conjectures to himpetya rapidly turning his head looked now at the drummer boy now atdenisov now at the esaul and now at the french in the village andalong the road trying not to miss anything of importancewhether dolokhov comes or not we must seize it eh said denisov witha merry sparkle in his eyesit is a very suitable spot said the esaulwell send the infantwy down by the swamps denisov continuedtheyll cweep up to the garden youll wide up fwom there with thecossackshe pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the villageand iwith my hussars fwom here and at the signal shotthe hollow is impassabletheres a swamp there said the esaul thehorses would sink we must ride round more to the leftwhile they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded fromthe low ground by the pond a puff of white smoke appeared thenanother and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry french voicesshouting together came up from the slope for a moment denisov and theesaul drew back they were so near that they thought they were the causeof the firing and shouting but the firing and shouting did not relateto them down below a man wearing something red was running through themarsh the french were evidently firing and shouting at himwhy thats our tikhon said the esaulso it is it isthe wascal said denisovhell get away said the esaul screwing up his eyesthe man whom they called tikhon having run to the stream plunged in sothat the water splashed in the air and having disappeared for aninstant scrambled out on all fours all black with the wet and ran onthe french who had been pursuing him stoppedsmart that said the esaulwhat a beast said denisov with his former look of vexation what hashe been doing all this timewho is he asked petyahes our plastun i sent him to capture a tongueoh yes said petya nodding at the first words denisov uttered as ifhe understood it all though he really did not understand anything ofittikhon shcherbaty was one of the most indispensable men in their bandhe was a peasant from pokrovsk near the river gzhat when denisov hadcome to pokrovsk at the beginning of his operations and had as usualsummoned the village elder and asked him what he knew about the frenchthe elder as though shielding himself had replied as all villageelders did that he had neither seen nor heard anything of them butwhen denisov explained that his purpose was to kill the french andasked if no french had strayed that way the elder replied that somemoreorderers had really been at their village but that tikhonshcherbaty was the only man who dealt with such matters denisov hadtikhon called and having praised him for his activity said a few wordsin the elders presence about loyalty to the tsar and the country andthe hatred of the french that all sons of the fatherland should cherishwe dont do the french any harm said tikhon evidently frightened bydenisovs words we only fooled about with the lads for fun you knowwe killed a score or so of moreorderers but we did no harm elsenext day when denisov had left pokrovsk having quite forgotten aboutthis peasant it was reported to him that tikhon had attached himself totheir party and asked to be allowed to remain with it denisov gaveorders to let him do sotikhon who at first did rough work laying campfires fetching waterflaying dead horses and so on soon showed a great liking and aptitudefor partisan warfare at night he would go out for booty and alwaysbrought back french clothing and weapons and when told to would bringin french captives also denisov then relieved him from drudgery andbegan taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had himenrolled among the cossackstikhon did not like riding and always went on foot never laggingbehind the cavalry he was armed with a musketoon which he carriedrather as a joke a pike and an ax which latter he used as a wolf usesits teeth with equal ease picking fleas out of its fur or crunchingthick bones tikhon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows atarms length or holding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegsor carve spoons in denisovs party he held a peculiar and exceptionalposition when anything particularly difficult or nasty had to be doneto push a cart out of the mud with ones shoulders pull a horse out ofa swamp by its tail skin it slink in among the french or walk morethan thirty miles in a dayeverybody pointed laughingly at tikhonit wont hurt that devilhes as strong as a horse they said of himonce a frenchman tikhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him andshot him in the fleshy part of the back that wound which tikhontreated only with internal and external applications of vodka was thesubject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachmentjokes in whichtikhon readily joinedhallo mate never again gave you a twist the cossacks would banterhim and tikhon purposely writhing and making faces pretended to beangry and swore at the french with the funniest curses the only effectof this incident on tikhon was that after being wounded he seldombrought in prisonershe was the bravest and most useful man in the party no one found moreopportunities for attacking no one captured or killed more frenchmenand consequently he was made the buffoon of all the cossacks and hussarsand willingly accepted that role now he had been sent by denisovovernight to shamshevo to capture a tongue but whether because he hadnot been content to take only one frenchman or because he had sleptthrough the night he had crept by day into some bushes right among thefrench and as denisov had witnessed from above had been detected bythemafter talking for some time with the esaul about next days attackwhich now seeing how near they were to the french he seemed to havedefinitely decided on denisov turned his horse and rode backnow my lad well go and get dwy he said to petyaas they approached the watchhouse denisov stopped peering into theforest among the trees a man with long legs and long swinging armswearing a short jacket bast shoes and a kazan hat was approachingwith long light steps he had a musketoon over his shoulder and an axstuck in his girdle when he espied denisov he hastily threw somethinginto the bushes removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim andapproached his commander it was tikhon his wrinkled and pockmarkedface and narrow little eyes beamed with selfsatisfied merriment helifted his head high and gazed at denisov as if repressing a laughwell where did you disappear to inquired denisovwhere did i disappear to i went to get frenchmen answered tikhonboldly and hurriedly in a husky but melodious bass voicewhy did you push yourself in there by daylight you ass well whyhavent you taken oneoh i took one all right said tikhonwhere is heyou see i took him first thing at dawn tikhon continued spreadingout his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes i took himinto the forest then i see hes no good and think ill go and fetch alikelier oneyou see what a wogueits just as i thought said denisov to theesaul why didnt you bwing that onewhat was the good of bringing him tikhon interrupted hastily andangrilythat one wouldnt have done for you as if i dont know whatsort you wantwhat a bwute you are welli went for another one tikhon continued and i crept like thisthrough the wood and lay down he suddenly lay down on his stomachwith a supple movement to show how he had done it one turned up and igrabbed him like this he jumped up quickly and lightly comealong to the colonel i said he starts yelling and suddenly therewere four of them they rushed at me with their little swords so i wentfor them with my ax this way what are you up to says i christ bewith you shouted tikhon waving his arms with an angry scowl andthrowing out his chestyes we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through thepuddles said the esaul screwing up his glittering eyespetya badly wanted to laugh but noticed that they all refrained fromlaughing he turned his eyes rapidly from tikhons face to the esaulsand denisovs unable to make out what it all meantdont play the fool said denisov coughing angrily why didnt youbwing the first onetikhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the otherthen suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming foolish grindisclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth that was why he was calledshcherbatythe gaptoothed denisov smiled and petya burst into apeal of merry laughter in which tikhon himself joinedoh but he was a regular goodfornothing said tikhon the clotheson himpoor stuff how could i bring him and so rude your honor whyhe says im a generals son myself i wont go he saysyou are a bwute said denisov i wanted to questionbut i questioned him said tikhon he said he didnt know muchthere are a lot of us he says but all poor stuffonly soldiers inname he says shout loud at them he says and youll take themall tikhon concluded looking cheerfully and resolutely intodenisovs eyesill give you a hundwed sharp lashesthatll teach you to play thefool said denisov severelybut why are you angry remonstrated tikhon just as if id never seenyour frenchmen only wait till it gets dark and ill fetch you any ofthem you wantthree if you likewell lets go said denisov and rode all the way to the watchhousein silence and frowning angrilytikhon followed behind and petya heard the cossacks laughing with himand at him about some pair of boots he had thrown into the busheswhen the fit of laughter that had seized him at tikhons words and smilehad passed and petya realized for a moment that this tikhon had killed aman he felt uneasy he looked round at the captive drummer boy and felta pang in his heart but this uneasiness lasted only a moment he feltit necessary to hold his head higher to brace himself and to questionthe esaul with an air of importance about tomorrows undertaking thathe might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himselfthe officer who had been sent to inquire met denisov on the way with thenews that dolokhov was soon coming and that all was well with himdenisov at once cheered up and calling petya to him said well tellme about yourselfpetya having left his people after their departure from moscow joinedhis regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general commanding alarge guerrilla detachment from the time he received his commissionand especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in thebattle of vyazma petya had been in a constant state of blissfulexcitement at being grownup and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not tomiss any chance to do something really heroic he was highly delightedwith what he saw and experienced in the army but at the same time italways seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were beingperformed just where he did not happen to be and he was always in ahurry to get where he was notwhen on the twentyfirst of october his general expressed a wish to sendsomebody to denisovs detachment petya begged so piteously to be sentthat the general could not refuse but when dispatching him he recalledpetyas mad action at the battle of vyazma where instead of riding bythe road to the place to which he had been sent he had galloped to theadvanced line under the fire of the french and had there twice fired hispistol so now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in anyaction whatever of denisovs that was why petya had blushed and grownconfused when denisov asked him whether he could stay before they hadridden to the outskirts of the forest petya had considered he must carryout his instructions strictly and return at once but when he saw thefrench and saw tikhon and learned that there would certainly be anattack that night he decided with the rapidity with which young peoplechange their views that the general whom he had greatly respected tillthen was a rubbishy german that denisov was a hero the esaul a heroand tikhon a hero too and that it would be shameful for him to leavethem at a moment of difficultyit was already growing dusk when denisov petya and the esaul rode upto the watchhouse in the twilight saddled horses could be seen andcossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade andwere kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the frenchcould not see the smoke in the passage of the small watchhouse acossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton in the roomthree officers of denisovs band were converting a door into a tabletoppetya took off his wet clothes gave them to be dried and at once beganhelping the officers to fix up the dinner tablein ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it on thetable were vodka a flask of rum white bread roast mutton and saltsitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory muttonwith his hands down which the grease trickled petya was in an ecstaticchildish state of love for all men and consequently of confidence thatothers loved him in the same wayso then what do you think vasili dmitrich said he to denisov itsall right my staying a day with you and not waiting for a reply heanswered his own question you see i was told to find outwell i amfinding out only do let me into the very into the chief idont want a reward but i wantpetya clenched his teeth and looked around throwing back his head andflourishing his armsinto the vewy chief denisov repeated with a smileonly please let me command something so that i may really commandpetya went on what would it be to you oh you want a knife hesaid turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of muttonand he handed him his clasp knife the officer admired itplease keep it i have several like it said petya blushingheavens i was quite forgetting he suddenly cried i have someraisins fine ones you know seedless ones we have a new sutler and hehas such capital things i bought ten pounds i am used to somethingsweet would you like some and petya ran out into the passage tohis cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five poundsof raisins have some gentlemen have someyou want a coffeepot dont you he asked the esaul i bought acapital one from our sutler he has splendid things and hes veryhonest thats the chief thing ill be sure to send it to you orperhaps your flints are giving out or are worn outthat happenssometimes you know i have brought some with me here they areand heshowed a baga hundred flints i bought them very cheap please takeas many as you want or all if you likethen suddenly dismayed lest he had said too much petya stopped andblushedhe tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that wasfoolish and running over the events of the day he remembered the frenchdrummer boy its capital for us here but what of him where have theyput him have they fed him havent they hurt his feelings he thoughtbut having caught himself saying too much about the flints he was nowafraid to speak outi might ask he thought but theyll say hes a boy himself and sohe pities the boy ill show them tomorrow whether im a boy will itseem odd if i ask petya thought well never mind and immediatelyblushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appearedironical he saidmay i call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him something toeat perhapsyes hes a poor little fellow said denisov who evidently sawnothing shameful in this reminder call him in his name is vincentbosse have him fetchedill call him said petyayes yes call him a poor little fellow denisov repeatedpetya was standing at the door when denisov said this he slipped inbetween the officers came close to denisov and saidlet me kiss you dear old fellow oh how fine how splendidand having kissed denisov he ran out of the hutbosse vincent petya cried stopping outside the doorwho do you want sir asked a voice in the darknesspetya replied that he wanted the french lad who had been captured thatdayah vesenny said a cossackvincent the boys name had already been changed by the cossacks intovesenny vernal and into vesenya by the peasants and soldiers in boththese adaptations the reference to spring vesna matched the impressionmade by the young ladhe is warming himself there by the bonfire ho vesenya vesenyavesenny laughing voices were heard calling to one another in thedarknesshes a smart lad said an hussar standing near petya we gave himsomething to eat a while ago he was awfully hungrythe sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in thedarkness and the drummer boy came to the doorah cest vous said petya voulezvous manger nayez pas peur onne vous fera pas de mal  he added shyly and affectionately touchingthe boys hand entrez entrez  ah its you do you want something to eat dont be afraid theywont hurt you  come in come inmerci monsieur  said the drummer boy in a trembling almost childishvoice and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold thank you sirthere were many things petya wanted to say to the drummer boy but didnot dare to he stood irresolutely beside him in the passage then inthe darkness he took the boys hand and pressed itcome in come in he repeated in a gentle whisper oh what can i dofor him he thought and opening the door he let the boy pass in firstwhen the boy had entered the hut petya sat down at a distance from himconsidering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him but hefingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seemridiculous to give some to the drummer boythe arrival of dolokhov diverted petyas attention from the drummer boyto whom denisov had had some mutton and vodka given and whom he had haddressed in a russian coat so that he might be kept with their band andnot sent away with the other prisoners petya had heard in the army manystories of dolokhovs extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to thefrench so from the moment he entered the hut petya did not take hiseyes from him but braced himself up more and more and held his headhigh that he might not be unworthy even of such companydolokhovs appearance amazed petya by its simplicitydenisov wore a cossack coat had a beard had an icon of nicholas thewonderworker on his breast and his way of speaking and everything hedid indicated his unusual position but dolokhov who in moscow had worna persian costume had now the appearance of a most correct officer ofthe guards he was cleanshaven and wore a guardsmans padded coat withan order of st george at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap setstraight on his head he took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of theroom and without greeting anyone went up to denisov and beganquestioning him about the matter in hand denisov told him of thedesigns the large detachments had on the transport of the message petyahad brought and his own replies to both generals then he told him allhe knew of the french detachmentthats so but we must know what troops they are and their numberssaid dolokhov it will be necessary to go there we cant start theaffair without knowing for certain how many there are i like to workaccurately here nowwouldnt one of these gentlemen like to ride overto the french camp with me i have brought a spare uniformi i ill go with you cried petyatheres no need for you to go at all said denisov addressingdolokhov and as for him i wont let him go on any accounti like that exclaimed petya why shouldnt i gobecause its uselesswell you must excuse me because because i shall go and thatsall youll take me wont you he said turning to dolokhovwhy not dolokhov answered absently scrutinizing the face of thefrench drummer boy have you had that youngster with you long heasked denisovhe was taken today but he knows nothing im keeping him with meyes and where do you put the others inquired dolokhovwhere i send them away and take a weceipt for them shouted denisovsuddenly flushing and i say boldly that i have not a single mans lifeon my conscience would it be difficult for you to send thirty or thweehundwed men to town under escort instead of stainingi speak bluntlystaining the honor of a soldierthat kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count ofsixteen said dolokhov with cold irony but its time for you to dropitwhy ive not said anything i only say that ill certainly go withyou said petya shylybut for you and me old fellow its time to drop these amenitiescontinued dolokhov as if he found particular pleasure in speaking ofthis subject which irritated denisov now why have you kept this ladhe went on swaying his head because you are sorry for him dont weknow those receipts of yours you send a hundred men away and thirtyget there the rest either starve or get killed so isnt it all thesame not to send themthe esaul screwing up his lightcolored eyes nodded approvinglythats not the point im not going to discuss the matter i do notwish to take it on my conscience you say theyll die all wight onlynot by my faultdolokhov began laughingwho has told them not to capture me these twenty times over but ifthey did catch me theyd string me up to an aspen tree and with allyour chivalry just the same he paused however we must get to worktell the cossack to fetch my kit i have two french uniforms in itwell are you coming with me he asked petyai yes yes certainly cried petya blushing almost to tears andglancing at denisovwhile dolokhov had been disputing with denisov what should be done withprisoners petya had once more felt awkward and restless but again hehad no time to grasp fully what they were talking about if grownupdistinguished men think so it must be necessary and right thought hebut above all denisov must not dare to imagine that ill obey him andthat he can order me about i will certainly go to the french camp withdolokhov if he can so can iand to all denisovs persuasions petya replied that he too wasaccustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow and that henever considered personal dangerfor youll admit that if we dont know for sure how many of them thereare hundreds of lives may depend on it while there are only two ofus besides i want to go very much and certainly will go so donthinder me said he it will only make things worsehaving put on french greatcoats and shakos petya and dolokhov rode tothe clearing from which denisov had reconnoitered the french camp andemerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into thehollow on reaching the bottom dolokhov told the cossacks accompanyinghim to await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to thebridge petya his heart in his mouth with excitement rode by his sideif were caught i wont be taken alive i have a pistol whisperedhedont talk russian said dolokhov in a hurried whisper and at thatvery moment they heard through the darkness the challenge qui vive and the click of a musket who goes therethe blood rushed to petyas face and he grasped his pistollanciers du me  replied dolokhov neither hastening nor slackeninghis horses pace lancers of the th regimentthe black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridgemot dordre  passworddolokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walkdites donc le colonel gerard est ici  he asked tell me is colonel gerard heremot dordre repeated the sentinel barring the way and not replyingquand un officier fait sa ronde les sentinelles ne demandent pas lemot dordre cried dolokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straightat the sentinel je vous demande si le colonel est ici  when an officer is making his round sentinels dont ask him for thepassword i am asking you if the colonel is hereand without waiting for an answer from the sentinel who had steppedaside dolokhov rode up the incline at a walknoticing the black outline of a man crossing the road dolokhov stoppedhim and inquired where the commander and officers were the man asoldier with a sack over his shoulder stopped came close up todolokhovs horse touched it with his hand and explained simply and ina friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up thehill to the right in the courtyard of the farm as he called thelandowners househaving ridden up the road on both sides of which french talk could beheard around the campfires dolokhov turned into the courtyard of thelandowners house having ridden in he dismounted and approached a bigblazing campfire around which sat several men talking noisilysomething was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and asoldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat lit up by the fire waskneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrodoh hes a hard nut to crack said one of the officers who was sittingin the shadow at the other side of the firehell make them get a move on those fellows said another laughingboth fell silent peering out through the darkness at the sound ofdolokhovs and petyas steps as they advanced to the fire leading theirhorsesbonjour messieurs  said dolokhov loudly and clearly good day gentlementhere was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire andone tall longnecked officer walking round the fire came up todolokhovis that you clement he asked where the devil but noticinghis mistake he broke off short and with a frown greeted dolokhov as astranger asking what he could do for himdolokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake theirregiment and addressing the company in general asked whether they knewanything of the th regiment none of them knew anything and petyathought the officers were beginning to look at him and dolokhov withhostility and suspicion for some seconds all were silentif you were counting on the evening soup you have come too late saida voice from behind the fire with a repressed laughdolokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther thatnighthe handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot andsquatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the longneck that officer did not take his eyes from dolokhov and again askedto what regiment he belonged dolokhov as if he had not heard thequestion did not reply but lighting a short french pipe which he tookfrom his pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before themwas safe from cossacksthose brigands are everywhere replied an officer from behind thefiredolokhov remarked that the cossacks were a danger only to stragglerssuch as his companion and himself but probably they would not dare toattack large detachments he added inquiringly no one repliedwell now hell come away petya thought every moment as he stood bythe campfire listening to the talkbut dolokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and beganputting direct questions as to how many men there were in the battalionhow many battalions and how many prisoners asking about the russianprisoners with that detachment dolokhov saida horrid business dragging these corpses about with one it would bebetter to shoot such rabble and burst into loud laughter so strangethat petya thought the french would immediately detect their disguiseand involuntarily took a step back from the campfireno one replied a word to dolokhovs laughter and a french officer whomthey could not see he lay wrapped in a greatcoat rose and whisperedsomething to a companion dolokhov got up and called to the soldier whowas holding their horseswill they bring our horses or not thought petya instinctivelydrawing nearer to dolokhovthe horses were broughtgood evening gentlemen said dolokhovpetya wished to say good night but could not utter a word theofficers were whispering together dolokhov was a long time mounting hishorse which would not stand still then he rode out of the yard at afootpace petya rode beside him longing to look round to see whether ornot the french were running after them but not daring tocoming out onto the road dolokhov did not ride back across the opencountry but through the village at one spot he stopped and listeneddo you hear he asked petya recognized the sound of russian voicesand saw the dark figures of russian prisoners round their campfireswhen they had descended to the bridge petya and dolokhov rode past thesentinel who without saying a word paced morosely up and down it thenthey descended into the hollow where the cossacks awaited themwell now goodby tell denisov at the first shot at daybreak saiddolokhov and was about to ride away but petya seized hold of himreally he cried you are such a hero oh how fine how splendidhow i love youall right all right said dolokhov but petya did not let go of himand dolokhov saw through the gloom that petya was bending toward him andwanted to kiss him dolokhov kissed him laughed turned his horse andvanished into the darknesshaving returned to the watchmans hut petya found denisov in thepassage he was awaiting petyas return in a state of agitationanxiety and selfreproach for having let him gothank god he exclaimed yes thank god he repeated listening topetyas rapturous account but devil take you i havent slept becauseof you well thank god now lie down we can still get a nap beforemorningbut no said petya i dont want to sleep yet besides i knowmyself if i fall asleep its finished and then i am used to notsleeping before a battlehe sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of hisexpedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next daythen noticing that denisov was asleep he rose and went out of doorsit was still quite dark outside the rain was over but drops were stillfalling from the trees near the watchmans hut the black shapes of thecossacks shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen behindthe hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside themwere discernible and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red notall the cossacks and hussars were asleep here and there amid thesounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by could beheard low voices which seemed to be whisperingpetya came out peered into the darkness and went up to the wagonssomeone was snoring under them and around them stood saddled horsesmunching their oats in the dark petya recognized his own horse whichhe called karabakh though it was of ukranian breed and went up to itwell karabakh well do some service tomorrow said he sniffing itsnostrils and kissing itwhy arent you asleep sir said a cossack who was sitting under awagonno ah likhachevisnt that your name do you know i have only justcome back weve been into the french campand petya gave the cossack a detailed account not only of his ride butalso of his object and why he considered it better to risk his lifethan to act just anyhowwell you should get some sleep now said the cossackno i am used to this said petya i say arent the flints in yourpistols worn out i brought some with me dont you want any you canhave somethe cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look atpetyabecause i am accustomed to doing everything accurately said petyasome fellows do things just anyhow without preparation and thentheyre sorry for it afterwards i dont like thatjust so said the cossackoh yes another thing please my dear fellow will you sharpen mysaber for me its got bl petya feared to tell a lie and the sabernever had been sharpened can you do itof course i canlikhachev got up rummaged in his pack and soon petya heard the warlikesound of steel on whetstone he climbed onto the wagon and sat on itsedge the cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagoni say are the lads asleep asked petyasome are and some arentlike uswell and that boyvesenny oh hes thrown himself down there in the passage fast asleepafter his fright he was that gladafter that petya remained silent for a long time listening to thesounds he heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appearedwhat are you sharpening asked a man coming up to the wagonwhy this gentlemans saberthats right said the man whom petya took to be an hussar was thecup left herethere by the wheelthe hussar took the cupit must be daylight soon said he yawning and went awaypetya ought to have known that he was in a forest with denisovsguerrilla band less than a mile from the road sitting on a wagoncaptured from the french beside which horses were tethered that underit likhachev was sitting sharpening a saber for him that the big darkblotch to the right was the watchmans hut and the red blotch below tothe left was the dying embers of a campfire that the man who had comefor the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink but he neither knew norwaited to know anything of all this he was in a fairy kingdom wherenothing resembled reality the big dark blotch might really be thewatchmans hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very depths of theearth perhaps the red spot was a fire or it might be the eye of anenormous monster perhaps he was really sitting on a wagon but it mightvery well be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly hightower from which if he fell he would have to fall for a whole day or awhole month or go on falling and never reach the bottom perhaps it wasjust the cossack likhachev who was sitting under the wagon but itmight be the kindest bravest most wonderful most splendid man in theworld whom no one knew of it might really have been that the hussarcame for water and went back into the hollow but perhaps he had simplyvanisheddisappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingnessnothing petya could have seen now would have surprised him he was in afairy kingdom where everything was possiblehe looked up at the sky and the sky was a fairy realm like the earthit was clearing and over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftlysailing as if unveiling the stars sometimes it looked as if the cloudswere passing and a clear black sky appeared sometimes it seemed as ifthe black spaces were clouds sometimes the sky seemed to be risinghigh high overhead and then it seemed to sink so low that one couldtouch it with ones handpetyas eyes began to close and he swayed a littlethe trees were dripping quiet talking was heard the horses neighed andjostled one another someone snoredozhegzheg ozhegzheg hissed the saber against the whetstone andsuddenly petya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknownsweetly solemn hymn petya was as musical as natasha and more so thannicholas but had never learned music or thought about it and so themelody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularlyfresh and attractive the music became more and more audible the melodygrew and passed from one instrument to another and what was played wasa fuguethough petya had not the least conception of what a fugue iseach instrumentnow resembling a violin and now a horn but better andclearer than violin or hornplayed its own part and before it hadfinished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost thesame air and then with a third and a fourth and they all blended intoone and again became separate and again blended now into solemn churchmusic now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphantohwhy that was in a dream petya said to himself as he lurchedforward its in my ears but perhaps its music of my own well goon my music nowhe closed his eyes and from all sides as if from a distance soundsfluttered grew into harmonies separated blended and again allmingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn oh this is delightful asmuch as i like and as i like said petya to himself he tried toconduct that enormous orchestranow softly softly die away and the sounds obeyed him now fullermore joyful still more and more joyful and from an unknown depth roseincreasingly triumphant sounds now voices join in ordered petya andat first from afar he heard mens voices and then womens the voicesgrew in harmonious triumphant strength and petya listened to theirsurpassing beauty in awe and joywith a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song the drip from thetrees and the hissing of the saber ozhegzhegzheg and again thehorses jostled one another and neighed not disturbing the choir butjoining in itpetya did not know how long this lasted he enjoyed himself all thetime wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no one toshare it he was awakened by likhachevs kindly voiceits ready your honor you can split a frenchman in half with itpetya woke upits getting light its really getting light he exclaimedthe horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to theirvery tails and a watery light showed itself through the bare branchespetya shook himself jumped up took a ruble from his pocket and gave itto likhachev then he flourished the saber tested it and sheathed itthe cossacks were untying their horses and tightening their saddlegirthsand heres the commander said likhachevdenisov came out of the watchmans hut and having called petya gaveorders to get readythe men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness tightenedtheir saddle girths and formed companies denisov stood by thewatchmans hut giving final orders the infantry of the detachmentpassed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mistof early dawn hundreds of feet splashing through the mud the esaulgave some orders to his men petya held his horse by the bridleimpatiently awaiting the order to mount his face having been bathed incold water was all aglow and his eyes were particularly brilliantcold shivers ran down his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmicallywell is evwything weady asked denisov bwing the horsesthe horses were brought denisov was angry with the cossack because thesaddle girths were too slack reproved him and mounted petya put hisfoot in the stirrup his horse by habit made as if to nip his leg butpetya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight andturning to look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him rodeup to denisovvasili dmitrich entrust me with some commission please for godssake said hedenisov seemed to have forgotten petyas very existence he turned toglance at himi ask one thing of you he said sternly to obey me and not shoveyourself forward anywherehe did not say another word to petya but rode in silence all the waywhen they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably growinglight over the field denisov talked in whispers with the esaul and thecossacks rode past petya and denisov when they had all ridden bydenisov touched his horse and rode down the hill slipping onto theirhaunches and sliding the horses descended with their riders into theravine petya rode beside denisov the pulsation of his body constantlyincreasing it was getting lighter and lighter but the mist still hiddistant objects having reached the valley denisov looked back andnodded to a cossack beside himthe signal said hethe cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out in an instant the trampof horses galloping forward was heard shouts came from various sidesand then more shotsat the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting petya lashed hishorse and loosening his rein galloped forward not heeding denisov whoshouted at him it seemed to petya that at the moment the shot was firedit suddenly became as bright as noon he galloped to the bridgecossacks were galloping along the road in front of him on the bridge hecollided with a cossack who had fallen behind but he galloped on infront of him soldiers probably frenchmen were running from right toleft across the road one of them fell in the mud under his horsesfeetcossacks were crowding about a hut busy with something from the midstof that crowd terrible screams arose petya galloped up and the firstthing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a frenchmanclutching the handle of a lance that had been aimed at himhurrah lads ours shouted petya and giving rein to hisexcited horse he galloped forward along the village streethe could hear shooting ahead of him cossacks hussars and raggedrussian prisoners who had come running from both sides of the roadwere shouting something loudly and incoherently a gallantlookingfrenchman in a blue overcoat capless and with a frowning red facehad been defending himself against the hussars when petya galloped upthe frenchman had already fallen too late again flashed throughpetyas mind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firingcould be heard the shots came from the yard of the landowners house hehad visited the night before with dolokhov the french were making astand there behind a wattle fence in a garden thickly overgrown withbushes and were firing at the cossacks who crowded at the gatewaythrough the smoke as he approached the gate petya saw dolokhov whoseface was of a palegreenish tint shouting to his men go round waitfor the infantry he exclaimed as petya rode up to himwait hurrahahah shouted petya and without pausing a momentgalloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where thesmoke was thickesta volley was heard and some bullets whistled past while others plashedagainst something the cossacks and dolokhov galloped after petya intothe gateway of the courtyard in the dense wavering smoke some of thefrench threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes to meet thecossacks while others ran down the hill toward the pond petya wasgalloping along the courtyard but instead of holding the reins he wavedboth his arms about rapidly and strangely slipping farther and fartherto one side in his saddle his horse having galloped up to a campfirethat was smoldering in the morning light stopped suddenly and petyafell heavily on to the wet ground the cossacks saw that his arms andlegs jerked rapidly though his head was quite motionless a bullet hadpierced his skullafter speaking to the senior french officer who came out of the housewith a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that theysurrendered dolokhov dismounted and went up to petya who laymotionless with outstretched armsdone for he said with a frown and went to the gate to meet denisovwho was riding toward himkilled cried denisov recognizing from a distance the unmistakablylifeless attitudevery familiar to himin which petyas body waslyingdone for repeated dolokhov as if the utterance of these wordsafforded him pleasure and he went quickly up to the prisoners who weresurrounded by cossacks who had hurried up we wont take them hecalled out to denisovdenisov did not reply he rode up to petya dismounted and withtrembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained mudbespatteredface which had already gone whitei am used to something sweet raisins fine ones take them all herecalled petyas words and the cossacks looked round in surprise at thesound like the yelp of a dog with which denisov turned away walked tothe wattle fence and seized hold of itamong the russian prisoners rescued by denisov and dolokhov was pierrebezukhovduring the whole of their march from moscow no fresh orders had beenissued by the french authorities concerning the party of prisoners amongwhom was pierre on the twentysecond of october that party was nolonger with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had leftmoscow half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the firststages with them had been captured by cossacks the other half had goneon ahead not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had marched infront of the prisoners was left they had all disappeared the artillerythe prisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was nowreplaced by marshal junots enormous baggage train convoyed bywestphalians behind the prisoners came a cavalry baggage trainfrom vyazma onwards the french army which had till then moved in threecolumns went on as a single group the symptoms of disorder that pierrehad noticed at their first halting place after leaving moscow had nowreached the utmost limitthe road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by deadhorses ragged men who had fallen behind from various regimentscontinually changed about now joining the moving column now againlagging behind itseveral times during the march false alarms had been given and thesoldiers of the escort had raised their muskets fired and runheadlong crushing one another but had afterwards reassembled andabused each other for their causeless panicthese three groups traveling togetherthe cavalry stores the convoy ofprisoners and junots baggage trainstill constituted a separate andunited whole though each of the groups was rapidly melting awayof the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred andtwenty wagons not more than sixty now remained the rest had beencaptured or left behind some of junots wagons also had been capturedor abandoned three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers fromdavouts corps from the talk of the germans pierre learned that alarger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to theprisoners and that one of their comrades a german soldier had beenshot by the marshals own order because a silver spoon belonging to themarshal had been found in his possessionthe group of prisoners had melted away most of all of the three hundredand thirty men who had set out from moscow fewer than a hundred nowremained the prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even thecavalry saddles or junots baggage they understood that the saddles andjunots spoon might be of some use but that cold and hungry soldiersshould have to stand and guard equally cold and hungry russians whofroze and lagged behind on the road in which case the order was toshoot them was not merely incomprehensible but revolting and theescort as if afraid in the grievous condition they themselves were inof giving way to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so renderingtheir own plight still worse treated them with particular morosenessand severityat dorogobuzh while the soldiers of the convoy after locking theprisoners in a stable had gone off to pillage their own stores severalof the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away but wererecaptured by the french and shotthe arrangement adopted when they started that the officer prisonersshould be kept separate from the rest had long since been abandonedall who could walk went together and after the third stage pierre hadrejoined karataev and the grayblue bandylegged dog that had chosenkarataev for its masteron the third day after leaving moscow karataev again fell ill with thefever he had suffered from in the hospital in moscow and as he grewgradually weaker pierre kept away from him pierre did not know why butsince karataev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to gonear him when he did so and heard the subdued moaning with whichkarataev generally lay down at the halting places and when he smelledthe odor emanating from him which was now stronger than before pierremoved farther away and did not think about himwhile imprisoned in the shed pierre had learned not with his intellectbut with his whole being by life itself that man is created forhappiness that happiness is within him in the satisfaction of simplehuman needs and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but fromsuperfluity and now during these last three weeks of the march he hadlearned still another new consolatory truththat nothing in this worldis terrible he had learned that as there is no condition in which mancan be happy and entirely free so there is no condition in which heneed be unhappy and lack freedom he learned that suffering and freedomhave their limits and that those limits are very near together that theperson in a bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly ashe now sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilledwhile the other was warming and that when he had put on tight dancingshoes he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feetthat were covered with soreshis footgear having long since fallen topieces he discovered that when he had married his wifeof his own freewill as it had seemed to himhe had been no more free than now whenthey locked him up at night in a stable of all that he himselfsubsequently termed his sufferings but which at the time he scarcelyfelt the worst was the state of his bare raw and scabcovered feetthe horseflesh was appetizing and nourishing the saltpeter flavor ofthe gunpowder they used instead of salt was even pleasant there was nogreat cold it was always warm walking in the daytime and at nightthere were the campfires the lice that devoured him warmed his bodythe one thing that was at first hard to bear was his feetafter the second days march pierre having examined his feet by thecampfire thought it would be impossible to walk on them but wheneverybody got up he went along limping and when he had warmed upwalked without feeling the pain though at night his feet were moreterrible to look at than before however he did not look at them nowbut thought of other thingsonly now did pierre realize the full strength of life in man and thesaving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing toanother which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allowssuperfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limithe did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who laggedbehind though more than a hundred perished in that way he did notthink of karataev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soonhave to share that fate still less did pierre think about himself theharder his position became and the more terrible the future the moreindependent of that position in which he found himself were the joyfuland comforting thoughts memories and imaginings that came to himat midday on the twentysecond of october pierre was going uphill alongthe muddy slippery road looking at his feet and at the roughness ofthe way occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him andthen again at his feet the former and the latter were alike familiarand his own the bluegray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the sideof the road sometimes in proof of its agility and selfsatisfactionlifting one hind leg and hopping along on three and then again going onall four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion thedog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in moscow all around laythe flesh of different animalsfrom men to horsesin various stages ofdecomposition and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men thedog could eat all it wantedit had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment itmight cease and the sky clear but after a short break it began rainingharder than before the saturated road no longer absorbed the waterwhich ran along the ruts in streamspierre walked along looking from side to side counting his steps inthrees and reckoning them off on his fingers mentally addressing therain he repeated now then now then go on pelt harderit seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing but far down and deepwithin him his soul was occupied with something important andcomforting this something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from aconversation with karataev the day beforeat their yesterdays halting place feeling chilly by a dying campfirepierre had got up and gone to the next one which was burning betterthere platon karataev was sitting covered uphead and allwith hisgreatcoat as if it were a vestment telling the soldiers in hiseffective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story pierre knew itwas already past midnight the hour when karataev was usually free ofhis fever and particularly lively when pierre reached the fire andheard platons voice enfeebled by illness and saw his pathetic facebrightly lit up by the blaze he felt a painful prick at his heart hisfeeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go awaybut there was no other fire and pierre sat down trying not to look atplatonwell how are you he askedhow am i if we grumble at sickness god wont grant us death repliedplaton and at once resumed the story he had begunand so brother he continued with a smile on his pale emaciated faceand a particularly happy light in his eyes you see brotherpierre had long been familiar with that story karataev had told it tohim alone some halfdozen times and always with a specially joyfulemotion but well as he knew it pierre now listened to that tale as tosomething new and the quiet rapture karataev evidently felt as he toldit communicated itself also to pierre the story was of an old merchantwho lived a good and godfearing life with his family and who went onceto the nizhni fair with a companiona rich merchanthaving put up at an inn they both went to sleep and next morning hiscompanion was found robbed and with his throat cut a bloodstained knifewas found under the old merchants pillow he was tried knouted andhis nostrils having been torn off all in due form as karataev put ithe was sent to hard labor in siberiaand so brother it was at this point that pierre came up ten yearsor more passed by the old man was living as a convict submitting as heshould and doing no wrong only he prayed to god for death well onenight the convicts were gathered just as we are with the old man amongthem and they began telling what each was suffering for and how theyhad sinned against god one told how he had taken a life another hadtaken two a third had set a house on fire while another had simplybeen a vagrant and had done nothing so they asked the old man whatare you being punished for daddyi my dear brothers said he ambeing punished for my own and other mens sins but i have not killedanyone or taken anything that was not mine but have only helped mypoorer brothers i was a merchant my dear brothers and had muchproperty and he went on to tell them all about it in due order idont grieve for myself he says god it seems has chastened meonly i am sorry for my old wife and the children and the old man beganto weep now it happened that in the group was the very man who hadkilled the other merchant where did it happen daddy he said whenand in what month he asked all about it and his heart began to acheso he comes up to the old man like this and falls down at his feetyou are perishing because of me daddy he says its quite truelads that this man he says is being tortured innocently and fornothing i he says did that deed and i put the knife under yourhead while you were asleep forgive me daddy he says for christssakekarataev paused smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire and he drewthe logs togetherand the old man said god will forgive you we are all sinners in hissight i suffer for my own sins and he wept bitter tears well andwhat do you think dear friends karataev continued his facebrightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he now hadto tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his storywhat do you think dear fellows that murderer confessed to theauthorities i have taken six lives he says he was a great sinnerbut what i am most sorry for is this old man dont let him sufferbecause of me so he confessed and it was all written down and thepapers sent off in due form the place was a long way off and whilethey were judging what with one thing and another filling in thepapers all in due formthe authorities i meantime passed the affairreached the tsar after a while the tsars decree came to set themerchant free and give him a compensation that had been awarded thepaper arrived and they began to look for the old man where is the oldman who has been suffering innocently and in vain a paper has come fromthe tsar so they began looking for him here karataevs lower jawtrembled but god had already forgiven himhe was dead thats how itwas dear fellows karataev concluded and sat for a long time silentgazing before him with a smileand pierres soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story itselfbut by its mysterious significance by the rapturous joy that lit upkarataevs face as he told it and the mystic significance of that joya vos places  suddenly cried a voice to your placesa pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something joyfuland solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and theprisoners from all sides came shouts of command and from the left camesmartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses passing the prisoners at atrot the expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at theapproach of those in authority the prisoners thronged together and werepushed off the road the convoy formed upthe emperor the emperor the marshal the duke and hardly had thesleek cavalry passed before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattledby pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a threecornered hat with atranquil look on his handsome plump white face it was one of themarshals his eye fell on pierres large and striking figure and in theexpression with which he frowned and looked away pierre thought hedetected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathythe general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with ared and frightened face whipping up his skinny horse several officersformed a group and some soldiers crowded round them their faces alllooked excited and worriedwhat did he say what did he say pierre heard them askwhile the marshal was passing the prisoners had huddled together in acrowd and pierre saw karataev whom he had not yet seen that morning hesat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree on his facebesides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday while tellingthe tale of the merchant who suffered innocently there was now anexpression of quiet solemnitykarataev looked at pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled withtears evidently wishing him to come near that he might say something tohim but pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself he made as if hedid not notice that look and moved hastily awaywhen the prisoners again went forward pierre looked round karataev wasstill sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and twofrenchmen were talking over his head pierre did not look round againbut went limping up the hillfrom behind where karataev had been sitting came the sound of a shotpierre heard it plainly but at that moment he remembered that he hadnot yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained tosmolenska calculation he had begun before the marshal went by and heagain started reckoning two french soldiers ran past pierre one ofwhom carried a lowered and smoking gun they both looked pale and inthe expression on their facesone of them glanced timidly at pierrethere was something resembling what he had seen on the face of the youngsoldier at the execution pierre looked at the soldier and rememberedthat two days before that man had burned his shirt while drying it atthe fire and how they had laughed at himbehind him where karataev had been sitting the dog began to howlwhat a stupid beast why is it howling thought pierrehis comrades the prisoner soldiers walking beside him avoided lookingback at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog was howlingjust as pierre did but there was a set look on all their facesthe stores the prisoners and the marshals baggage train stopped atthe village of shamshevo the men crowded together round the campfirespierre went up to the fire ate some roast horseflesh lay down with hisback to the fire and immediately fell asleep he again slept as he haddone at mozhaysk after the battle of borodinoagain real events mingled with dreams and again someone he or anothergave expression to his thoughts and even to the same thoughts that hadbeen expressed in his dream at mozhaysklife is everything life is god everything changes and moves and thatmovement is god and while there is life there is joy in consciousnessof the divine to love life is to love god harder and more blessed thanall else is to love this life in ones sufferings in innocentsufferingskarataev came to pierres mindand suddenly he saw vividly before him a longforgotten kindly old manwho had given him geography lessons in switzerland wait a bit saidthe old man and showed pierre a globe this globe was aliveavibrating ball without fixed dimensions its whole surface consisted ofdrops closely pressed together and all these drops moved and changedplaces sometimes several of them merging into one sometimes onedividing into many each drop tried to spread out and occupy as muchspace as possible but others striving to do the same compressed itsometimes destroyed it and sometimes merged with itthat is life said the old teacherhow simple and clear it is thought pierre how is it i did not knowit beforegod is in the midst and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect himto the greatest extent and it grows merges disappears from thesurface sinks to the depths and again emerges there now karataev hasspread out and disappeared do you understand my child said theteacherdo you understand damn you shouted a voice and pierre woke uphe lifted himself and sat up a frenchman who had just pushed a russiansoldier away was squatting by the fire engaged in roasting a piece ofmeat stuck on a ramrod his sleeves were rolled up and his sinewyhairy red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod hisbrown morose face with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow ofthe charcoalits all the same to him he muttered turning quickly to a soldierwho stood behind him brigand get awayand twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at pierre who turned awayand gazed into the darkness a prisoner the russian soldier thefrenchman had pushed away was sitting near the fire patting somethingwith his hand looking more closely pierre recognized the bluegray dogsitting beside the soldier wagging its tailah hes come said pierre and plat he began but did not finishsuddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his fancyofthe look platon had given him as he sat under the tree of the shotheard from that spot of the dogs howl of the guilty faces of the twofrenchmen as they ran past him of the lowered and smoking gun and ofkarataevs absence at this haltand he was on the point of realizingthat karataev had been killed but just at that instant he knew notwhy the recollection came to his mind of a summer evening he had spentwith a beautiful polish lady on the veranda of his house in kiev andwithout linking up the events of the day or drawing a conclusion fromthem pierre closed his eyes seeing a vision of the country insummertime mingled with memories of bathing and of the liquid vibratingglobe and he sank into water so that it closed over his headbefore sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid firingfrench soldiers were running past himthe cossacks one of them shouted and a moment later a crowd ofrussians surrounded pierrefor a long time he could not understand what was happening to him allaround he heard his comrades sobbing with joybrothers dear fellows darlings old soldiers exclaimed weeping asthey embraced cossacks and hussarsthe hussars and cossacks crowded round the prisoners one offered themclothes another boots and a third bread pierre sobbed as he sat amongthem and could not utter a word he hugged the first soldier whoapproached him and kissed him weepingdolokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house letting a crowd ofdisarmed frenchmen pass by the french excited by all that hadhappened were talking loudly among themselves but as they passeddolokhov who gently switched his boots with his whip and watched themwith cold glassy eyes that boded no good they became silent on theopposite side stood dolokhovs cossack counting the prisoners andmarking off each hundred with a chalk line on the gatehow many dolokhov asked the cossackthe second hundred replied the cossackfilez filez  dolokhov kept saying having adopted this expressionfrom the french and when his eyes met those of the prisoners theyflashed with a cruel light get along get alongdenisov bareheaded and with a gloomy face walked behind some cossackswho were carrying the body of petya rostov to a hole that had been dugin the gardenafter the twentyeighth of october when the frosts began the flight ofthe french assumed a still more tragic character with men freezing orroasting themselves to death at the campfires while carriages withpeople dressed in furs continued to drive past carrying away theproperty that had been stolen by the emperor kings and dukes but theprocess of the flight and disintegration of the french army went onessentially as beforefrom moscow to vyazma the french army of seventythree thousand men notreckoning the guards who did nothing during the whole war but pillagewas reduced to thirtysix thousand though not more than five thousandhad fallen in battle from this beginning the succeeding terms of theprogression could be determined mathematically the french army meltedaway and perished at the same rate from moscow to vyazma from vyazma tosmolensk from smolensk to the berezina and from the berezina to vilnaindependently of the greater or lesser intensity of the cold thepursuit the barring of the way or any other particular conditionsbeyond vyazma the french army instead of moving in three columns huddledtogether into one mass and so went on to the end berthier wrote to hisemperor we know how far commanding officers allow themselves to divergefrom the truth in describing the condition of an army and this is whathe saidi deem it my duty to report to your majesty the condition of the variouscorps i have had occasion to observe during different stages of the lasttwo or three days march they are almost disbanded scarcely a quarterof the soldiers remain with the standards of their regiments the othersgo off by themselves in different directions hoping to find food andescape discipline in general they regard smolensk as the place wherethey hope to recover during the last few days many of the men have beenseen to throw away their cartridges and their arms in such a state ofaffairs whatever your ultimate plans may be the interest of yourmajestys service demands that the army should be rallied at smolenskand should first of all be freed from ineffectives such as dismountedcavalry unnecessary baggage and artillery material that is no longerin proportion to the present forces the soldiers who are worn out withhunger and fatigue need these supplies as well as a few days restmany have died these last days on the road or at the bivouacs thisstate of things is continually becoming worse and makes one fear thatunless a prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be undercontrol in case of an engagementnovember  twenty miles from smolenskafter staggering into smolensk which seemed to them a promised land thefrench searching for food killed one another sacked their own storesand when everything had been plundered fled fartherthey all went without knowing whither or why they were going still lessdid that genius napoleon know it for no one issued any orders to himbut still he and those about him retained their old habits wrotecommands letters reports and orders of the day called one anothersire mon cousin prince deckmuhl roi de naples and so on but theseorders and reports were only on paper nothing in them was acted uponfor they could not be carried out and though they entitled one anothermajesties highnesses or cousins they all felt that they weremiserable wretches who had done much evil for which they had now to payand though they pretended to be concerned about the army each wasthinking only of himself and of how to get away quickly and savehimselfthe movements of the russian and french armies during the campaign frommoscow back to the niemen were like those in a game of russianblindmans bluff in which two players are blindfolded and one of themoccasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher of hiswhereabouts first he rings his bell fearlessly but when he gets into atight place he runs away as quietly as he can and often thinking toescape runs straight into his opponents armsat first while they were still moving along the kaluga road napoleonsarmies made their presence known but later when they reached thesmolensk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tightandoften thinking they were escaping ran right into the russiansowing to the rapidity of the french flight and the russian pursuit andthe consequent exhaustion of the horses the chief means ofapproximately ascertaining the enemys positionby cavalry scoutingwas not available besides as a result of the frequent and rapid changeof position by each army even what information was obtained could notbe delivered in time if news was received one day that the enemy hadbeen in a certain position the day before by the third day whensomething could have been done that army was already two days marchfarther on and in quite another positionone army fled and the other pursued beyond smolensk there were severaldifferent roads available for the french and one would have thoughtthat during their stay of four days they might have learned where theenemy was might have arranged some more advantageous plan andundertaken something new but after a four days halt the mob with nomaneuvers or plans again began running along the beaten track neitherto the right nor to the left but along the oldthe worstroad throughkrasnoe and orshaexpecting the enemy from behind and not in front the french separatedin their flight and spread out over a distance of twentyfour hours infront of them all fled the emperor then the kings then the dukes therussian army expecting napoleon to take the road to the right beyondthe dnieperwhich was the only reasonable thing for him to dothemselves turned to the right and came out onto the highroad atkrasnoe and here as in a game of blindmans buff the french ran intoour vanguard seeing their enemy unexpectedly the french fell intoconfusion and stopped short from the sudden fright but then theyresumed their flight abandoning their comrades who were farther behindthen for three days separate portions of the french armyfirst muratsthe vicekings then davouts and then neysran as it were thegauntlet of the russian army they abandoned one another abandoned alltheir heavy baggage their artillery and half their men and fledgetting past the russians by night by making semicircles to the rightney who came last had been busying himself blowing up the walls ofsmolensk which were in nobodys way because despite the unfortunateplight of the french or because of it they wished to punish the flooragainst which they had hurt themselves ney who had had a corps of tenthousand men reached napoleon at orsha with only one thousand men lefthaving abandoned all the rest and all his cannon and having crossed thednieper at night by stealth at a wooded spotfrom orsha they fled farther along the road to vilna still playing atblindmans buff with the pursuing army at the berezina they againbecame disorganized many were drowned and many surrendered but thosewho got across the river fled farther their supreme chief donned a furcoat and having seated himself in a sleigh galloped on aloneabandoning his companions the others who could do so drove away tooleaving those who could not to surrender or diethis campaign consisted in a flight of the french during which they didall they could to destroy themselves from the time they turned onto thekaluga road to the day their leader fled from the army none of themovements of the crowd had any sense so one might have thought thatregarding this period of the campaign the historians who attributed theactions of the mass to the will of one man would have found itimpossible to make the story of the retreat fit their theory but nomountains of books have been written by the historians about thiscampaign and everywhere are described napoleons arrangements themaneuvers and his profound plans which guided the army as well as themilitary genius shown by his marshalsthe retreat from maloyaroslavets when he had a free road into a wellsupplied district and the parallel road was open to him along whichkutuzov afterwards pursued himthis unnecessary retreat along adevastated roadis explained to us as being due to profoundconsiderations similarly profound considerations are given for hisretreat from smolensk to orsha then his heroism at krasnoe isdescribed where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battleand take personal command and to have walked about with a birch stickand saidjai assez fait lempereur il est temps de faire le general  butnevertheless immediately ran away again abandoning to its fate thescattered fragments of the army he left behind i have acted the emperor long enough it is time to act the generalthen we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals especially ofneya greatness of soul consisting in this that he made his way bynight around through the forest and across the dnieper and escaped toorsha abandoning standards artillery and nine tenths of his menand lastly the final departure of the great emperor from his heroicarmy is presented to us by the historians as something great andcharacteristic of genius even that final running away described inordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child istaught to be ashamed ofeven that act finds justification in thehistorians languagewhen it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of historicalratiocination any farther when actions are clearly contrary to all thathumanity calls right or even just the historians produce a savingconception of greatness greatness it seems excludes the standardsof right and wrong for the great man nothing is wrong there is noatrocity for which a great man can be blamedcest grand  say the historians and there no longer exists eithergood or evil but only grand and not grand grand is good not grandis bad grand is the characteristic in their conception of somespecial animals called heroes and napoleon escaping home in a warmfur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his comradesbut were in his opinion men he had brought there feels que cestgrand  and his soul is tranquil it is great  that it is greatdu sublime he saw something sublime in himself au ridicule il ny aquun pas  said he and the whole world for fifty years has beenrepeating sublime grand napoleon le grand du sublime au ridiculeil ny a quun pas from the sublime to the ridiculous is but a stepand it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable withthe standard of right and wrong is merely to admit ones own nothingnessand immeasurable meannessfor us with the standard of good and evil given us by christ no humanactions are incommensurable and there is no greatness where simplicitygoodness and truth are absentwhat russian reading the account of the last part of the campaign of has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regretdissatisfaction and perplexity who has not asked himself how it isthat the french were not all captured or destroyed when our three armiessurrounded them in superior numbers when the disordered french hungryand freezing surrendered in crowds and when as the historians relatethe aim of the russians was to stop the french to cut them off andcapture them allhow was it that the russian army which when numerically weaker than thefrench had given battle at borodino did not achieve its purpose when ithad surrounded the french on three sides and when its aim was to capturethem can the french be so enormously superior to us that when we hadsurrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them how couldthat happenhistory or what is called by that name replying to these questionssays that this occurred because kutuzov and tormasov and chichagov andthis man and that man did not execute such and such maneuversbut why did they not execute those maneuvers and why if they wereguilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried andpunished but even if we admitted that kutuzov chichagov and otherswere the cause of the russian failures it is still incomprehensiblewhy the position of the russian army being what it was at krasnoe andat the berezina in both cases we had superior forces the french armywith its marshals kings and emperor was not captured if that was whatthe russians aimed atthe explanation of this strange fact given by russian militaryhistorians to the effect that kutuzov hindered an attack is unfoundedfor we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking atvyazma and tarutinowhy was the russian armywhich with inferior forces had withstood theenemy in full strength at borodinodefeated at krasnoe and the berezinaby the disorganized crowds of the french when it was numericallysuperiorif the aim of the russians consisted in cutting off and capturingnapoleon and his marshalsand that aim was not merely frustrated butall attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffledthen this lastperiod of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the french to be aseries of victories and quite wrongly considered victorious by russianhistoriansthe russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims oflogic must admit that conclusion and in spite of their lyricalrhapsodies about valor devotion and so forth must reluctantly admitthat the french retreat from moscow was a series of victories fornapoleon and defeats for kutuzovbut putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such aconclusion involves a contradiction since the series of frenchvictories brought the french complete destruction while the series ofrussian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and theliberation of their countrythe source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historiansstudying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generalsfrom memoirs reports projects and so forth have attributed to thislast period of the war of  an aim that never existed namely that ofcutting off and capturing napoleon with his marshals and his armythere never was or could have been such an aim for it would have beensenseless and its attainment quite impossibleit would have been senseless first because napoleons disorganized armywas flying from russia with all possible speed that is to say wasdoing just what every russian desired so what was the use of performingvarious operations on the french who were running away as fast as theypossibly couldsecondly it would have been senseless to block the passage of men whosewhole energy was directed to flightthirdly it would have been senseless to sacrifice ones own troops inorder to destroy the french army which without external interferencewas destroying itself at such a rate that though its path was notblocked it could not carry across the frontier more than it actuallydid in december namely a hundredth part of the original armyfourthly it would have been senseless to wish to take captive theemperor kings and dukeswhose capture would have been in the highestdegree embarrassing for the russians as the most adroit diplomatists ofthe time joseph de maistre and others recognized still more senselesswould have been the wish to capture army corps of the french when ourown army had melted away to half before reaching krasnoe and a wholedivision would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners andwhen our men were not always getting full rations and the prisonersalready taken were perishing of hungerall the profound plans about cutting off and capturing napoleon and hisarmy were like the plan of a market gardener who when driving out ofhis garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted shouldrun to the gate and hit the cow on the head the only thing to be saidin excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry but not eventhat could be said for those who drew up this project for it was notthey who had suffered from the trampled bedsbut besides the fact that cutting off napoleon with his army would havebeen senseless it was impossibleit was impossible first becauseas experience shows that a threemilemovement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the planstheprobability of chichagov kutuzov and wittgenstein effecting a junctionon time at an appointed place was so remote as to be tantamount toimpossibility as in fact thought kutuzov who when he received the planremarked that diversions planned over great distances do not yield thedesired resultssecondly it was impossible because to paralyze the momentum with whichnapoleons army was retiring incomparably greater forces than therussians possessed would have been requiredthirdly it was impossible because the military term to cut off has nomeaning one can cut off a slice of bread but not an army to cut offan armyto bar its roadis quite impossible for there is alwaysplenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing canbe seen as the military scientists might convince themselves by theexample of krasnoe and of the berezina it is only possible to captureprisoners if they agree to be captured just as it is only possible tocatch a swallow if it settles on ones hand men can only be takenprisoners if they surrender according to the rules of strategy andtactics as the germans did but the french troops quite rightly did notconsider that this suited them since death by hunger and cold awaitedthem in flight or captivity alikefourthly and chiefly it was impossible because never since the worldbegan has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtainedin  and the russian army in its pursuit of the french strained itsstrength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroyingitselfduring the movement of the russian army from tarutino to krasnoe it lostfifty thousand sick or stragglers that is a number equal to thepopulation of a large provincial town half the men fell out of the armywithout a battleand it is of this period of the campaignwhen the army lacked boots andsheepskin coats was short of provisions and without vodka and wascamping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees offrost when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and therest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot bemaintained when men were taken into that region of death wherediscipline fails not for a few hours only as in a battle but formonths where they were every moment fighting death from hunger andcold when half the army perished in a single monthit is of thisperiod of the campaign that the historians tell us how miloradovichshould have made a flank march to such and such a place tormasov toanother place and chichagov should have crossed more than kneedeep insnow to somewhere else and how soandso routed and cut off thefrench and so on and so onthe russians half of whom died did all that could and should have beendone to attain an end worthy of the nation and they are not to blamebecause other russians sitting in warm rooms proposed that they shoulddo what was impossibleall that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between thefacts and the historical accounts only arises because the historiansdealing with the matter have written the history of the beautiful wordsand sentiments of various generals and not the history of the eventsto them the words of miloradovich seem very interesting and so do theirsurmises and the rewards this or that general received but the questionof those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in gravesdoes not even interest them for it does not come within the range oftheir investigationyet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans andconsider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took adirect part in the events and all the questions that seemed insolubleeasily and simply receive an immediate and certain solutionthe aim of cutting off napoleon and his army never existed except in theimaginations of a dozen people it could not exist because it wassenseless and unattainablethe people had a single aim to free their land from invasion that aimwas attained in the first place of itself as the french ran away andso it was only necessary not to stop their flight secondly it wasattained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the french andthirdly by the fact that a large russian army was following the frenchready to use its strength in case their movement stoppedthe russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal and theexperienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as amenace than to strike the running animal on the headwhen seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror substancesimilar to his own is perishing before his eyes but when it is abeloved and intimate human being that is dying besides this horror atthe extinction of life there is a severance a spiritual wound whichlike a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes heals but alwaysaches and shrinks at any external irritating touchafter prince andrews death natasha and princess mary alike felt thisdrooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing cloud ofdeath that overhung them they dared not look life in the face theycarefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contacteverything a carriage passing rapidly in the street a summons todinner the maids inquiry what dress to prepare or worse still anyword of insincere or feeble sympathy seemed an insult painfullyirritated the wound interrupting that necessary quiet in which theyboth tried to listen to the stern and dreadful choir that stillresounded in their imagination and hindered their gazing into thosemysterious limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out beforethemonly when alone together were they free from such outrage and pain theyspoke little even to one another and when they did it was of veryunimportant mattersboth avoided any allusion to the future to admit the possibility of afuture seemed to them to insult his memory still more carefully didthey avoid anything relating to him who was dead it seemed to them thatwhat they had lived through and experienced could not be expressed inwords and that any reference to the details of his life infringed themajesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been accomplished beforetheir eyescontinued abstention from speech and constant avoidance of everythingthat might lead up to the subjectthis halting on all sides at theboundary of what they might not mentionbrought before their minds withstill greater purity and clearness what they were both feelingbut pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete joyprincess mary in her position as absolute and independent arbiter ofher own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew was the first tobe called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dweltfor the first fortnight she received letters from her relations towhich she had to reply the room in which little nicholas had been putwas damp and he began to cough alpatych came to yaroslavl with reportson the state of their affairs and with advice and suggestions that theyshould return to moscow to the house on the vozdvizhenka street whichhad remained uninjured and needed only slight repairs life did notstand still and it was necessary to live hard as it was for princessmary to emerge from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she hadlived till then and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leavenatasha alone yet the cares of life demanded her attention and sheinvoluntarily yielded to them she went through the accounts withalpatych conferred with dessalles about her nephew and gave orders andmade preparations for the journey to moscownatasha remained alone and from the time princess mary began makingpreparations for departure held aloof from her tooprincess mary asked the countess to let natasha go with her to moscowand both parents gladly accepted this offer for they saw their daughterlosing strength every day and thought that a change of scene and theadvice of moscow doctors would be good for heri am not going anywhere natasha replied when this was proposed toher do please just leave me alone and she ran out of the room withdifficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation rather thanof sorrowafter she felt herself deserted by princes mary and alone in her griefnatasha spent most of the time in her room by herself sitting huddledup feet and all in the corner of the sofa tearing and twistingsomething with her slender nervous fingers and gazing intently andfixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on this solitude exhaustedand tormented her but she was in absolute need of it as soon as anyoneentered she got up quickly changed her position and expression andpicked up a book or some sewing evidently waiting impatiently for theintruder to goshe felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that onwhichwith a terrible questioning too great for her strengthherspiritual gaze was fixedone day toward the end of december natasha pale and thin dressed in ablack woolen gown her plaited hair negligently twisted into a knot wascrouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa nervously crumpling andsmoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at a corner of thedoorshe was gazing in the direction in which he had goneto the other sideof life and that other side of life of which she had never beforethought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and improbablewas now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible than this side oflife where everything was either emptiness and desolation or sufferingand indignityshe was gazing where she knew him to be but she could not imagine himotherwise than as he had been here she now saw him again as he had beenat mytishchi at troitsa and at yaroslavlshe saw his face heard his voice repeated his words and her own andsometimes devised other words they might have spokenthere he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak leaning hishead on his thin pale hand his chest is dreadfully hollow and hisshoulders raised his lips are firmly closed his eyes glitter and awrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead one of his legs twitchesjust perceptibly but rapidly natasha knows that he is struggling withterrible pain what is that pain like why does he have that pain whatdoes he feel how does it hurt him thought natasha he noticed herwatching him raised his eyes and began to speak seriouslyone thing would be terrible said he to bind oneself forever to asuffering man it would be continual torture and he looked searchinglyat her natasha as usual answered before she had time to think what shewould say she said this cant go onit wont you will get wellquite wellshe now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what shehad then felt she recalled his long sad and severe look at those wordsand understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in that protractedgazei agreed natasha now said to herself that it would be dreadful ifhe always continued to suffer i said it then only because it would havebeen dreadful for him but he understood it differently he thought itwould be dreadful for me he then still wished to live and feared deathand i said it so awkwardly and stupidly i did not say what i meant ithought quite differently had i said what i thought i should havesaid even if he had to go on dying to die continually before my eyesi should have been happy compared with what i am now now there isnothing nobody did he know that no he did not and never will knowit and now it will never never be possible to put it right and nowhe again seemed to be saying the same words to her only in herimagination natasha this time gave him a different answer she stoppedhim and said terrible for you but not for me you know that for methere is nothing in life but you and to suffer with you is the greatesthappiness for me and he took her hand and pressed it as he had pressedit that terrible evening four days before his death and in herimagination she said other tender and loving words which she might havesaid then but only spoke now i love thee thee i love loveshe said convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with adesperate effortshe was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in hereyes then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this againeverything was shrouded in hard dry perplexity and again with astrained frown she peered toward the world where he was and now now itseemed to her she was penetrating the mystery but at the instantwhen it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing itself to her aloud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her ears dunyashaher maid entered the room quickly and abruptly with a frightened lookon her face and showing no concern for her mistresscome to your papa at once please said she with a strange excitedlook a misfortune about peter ilynich a letter she finishedwith a sobbesides a feeling of aloofness from everybody natasha was feeling aspecial estrangement from the members of her own family all of themher father mother and sonyawere so near to her so familiar socommonplace that all their words and feelings seemed an insult to theworld in which she had been living of late and she felt not merelyindifferent to them but regarded them with hostility she hearddunyashas words about peter ilynich and a misfortune but did not graspthemwhat misfortune what misfortune can happen to them they just livetheir own old quiet and commonplace life thought natashaas she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of hermothers room his face was puckered up and wet with tears he hadevidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that werechoking him when he saw natasha he waved his arms despairingly andburst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round facepe petya go go she is calling and weeping like a childand quickly shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair he almost fell intoit covering his face with his handssuddenly an electric shock seemed to run through natashas whole beingterrible anguish struck her heart she felt a dreadful ache as ifsomething was being torn inside her and she were dying but the pain wasimmediately followed by a feeling of release from the oppressiveconstraint that had prevented her taking part in life the sight of herfather the terribly wild cries of her mother that she heard through thedoor made her immediately forget herself and her own griefshe ran to her father but he feebly waved his arm pointing to hermothers door princess mary pale and with quivering chin came outfrom that room and taking natasha by the arm said something to hernatasha neither saw nor heard her she went in with rapid steps pausingat the door for an instant as if struggling with herself and then ranto her motherthe countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward positionstretching out and beating her head against the wall sonya and themaids were holding her armsnatasha natasha cried the countess its not true its

and gazed long at itnatasha you love me she said in a soft trustful whisper natashayou would not deceive me youll tell me the whole truthnatasha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look there wasnothing but love and an entreaty for forgivenessmy darling mummy she repeated straining all the power of her love tofind some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that crushed hermotherand again in a futile struggle with reality her mother refusing tobelieve that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in the bloomof life escaped from reality into a world of deliriumnatasha did not remember how that day passed nor that night nor thenext day and night she did not sleep and did not leave her mother herpersevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the countessevery moment not explaining or consoling but recalling her to lifeduring the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutesand natasha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyesbut opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak the countess wassitting up in bed and speaking softlyhow glad i am you have come you are tired wont you have some

daughter the countess began to weep for the firsttimeprincess mary postponed her departure sonya and the count tried toreplace natasha but could not they saw that she alone was able torestrain her mother from unreasoning despair for three weeks natasharemained constantly at her mothers side sleeping on a lounge chair inher room making her eat and drink and talking to her incessantlybecause the mere sound of her tender caressing tones soothed hermotherthe mothers wounded spirit could not heal petyas death had torn fromher half her life when the news of petyas death had come she had beena fresh and vigorous woman of fifty but a month later she left her rooma listless old woman taking no interest in life but the same blow thatalmost killed the countess this second blow restored natasha to lifea spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like aphysical wound and strange as it may seem just as a deep wound mayheal and its edges join physical and spiritual wounds alike can yetheal completely only as the result of a vital force from withinnatashas wound healed in that way she thought her life was ended buther love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence oflifelovewas still active within her love awoke and so did lifeprince andrews last days had bound princess mary and natasha togetherthis new sorrow brought them still closer to one another princess maryput off her departure and for three weeks looked after natasha as ifshe had been a sick child the last weeks passed in her mothers bedroomhad strained natashas physical strengthone afternoon noticing natasha shivering with fever princess mary tookher to her own room and made her lie down on the bed natasha lay downbut when princess mary had drawn the blinds and was going away shecalled her backi dont want to sleep mary sit by me a littleyou are tiredtry to sleepno no why did you bring me away she will be asking for meshe is much better she spoke so well today said princess marynatasha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scannedprincess marys faceis she like him thought natasha yes like and yet not like but sheis quite original strange new and unknown and she loves me what isin her heart all that is good but how what is her mind like whatdoes she think about me yes she is splendidmary she said timidly drawing princess marys hand to herselfmary you mustnt think me wicked no mary darling how i love youlet us be quite quite friendsand natasha embracing her began kissing her face and hands makingprincess mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelingsfrom that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists onlybetween women was established between princess mary and natasha theywere continually kissing and saying tender things to one another andspent most of their time together when one went out the other becamerestless and hastened to rejoin her together they felt more in harmonywith one another than either of them felt with herself when alone afeeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them an exclusivefeeling of life being possible only in each others presencesometimes they were silent for hours sometimes after they were alreadyin bed they would begin talking and go on till morning they spoke mostof what was long past princess mary spoke of her childhood of hermother her father and her daydreams and natasha who with a passivelack of understanding had formerly turned away from that life ofdevotion submission and the poetry of christian selfsacrifice nowfeeling herself bound to princess mary by affection learned to love herpast too and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible toher she did not think of applying submission and selfabnegation to herown life for she was accustomed to seek other joys but she understoodand loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues forprincess mary listening to natashas tales of childhood and earlyyouth there also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side oflife belief in life and its enjoymentjust as before they never mentioned him so as not to lower as theythought their exalted feelings by words but this silence about him hadthe effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without beingconscious of itnatasha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they alltalked about her health and this pleased her but sometimes she wassuddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness weaknessand loss of good looks and involuntarily she examined her bare armcarefully surprised at its thinness and in the morning noticed herdrawn and as it seemed to her piteous face in her glass it seemed toher that things must be so and yet it was dreadfully sadone day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breathunconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down andthen testing her strength ran upstairs again observing the resultanother time when she called dunyasha her voice trembled so she calledagainthough she could hear dunyasha comingcalled her in the deepchest tones in which she had been wont to sing and listened attentivelyto herselfshe did not know and would not have believed it but beneath the layerof slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable delicateyoung shoots of grass were already sprouting which taking root would socover with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that itwould soon no longer be seen or noticed the wound had begun to healfrom withinat the end of january princess mary left for moscow and the countinsisted on natashas going with her to consult the doctorsafter the encounter at vyazma where kutuzov had been unable to holdback his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy andso on the farther movement of the fleeing french and of the russianswho pursued them continued as far as krasnoe without a battle theflight was so rapid that the russian army pursuing the french could notkeep up with them cavalry and artillery horses broke down and theinformation received of the movements of the french was never reliablethe men in the russian army were so worn out by this continuous marchingat the rate of twentyseven miles a day that they could not go anyfasterto realize the degree of exhaustion of the russian army it is onlynecessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that while notlosing more than five thousand killed and wounded after tarutino andless than a hundred prisoners the russian army which left that place ahundred thousand strong reached krasnoe with only fifty thousandthe rapidity of the russian pursuit was just as destructive to our armyas the flight of the french was to theirs the only difference was thatthe russian army moved voluntarily with no such threat of destructionas hung over the french and that the sick frenchmen were left behind inenemy hands while the sick russians left behind were among their ownpeople the chief cause of the wastage of napoleons army was therapidity of its movement and a convincing proof of this is thecorresponding decrease of the russian armykutuzov as far as was in his power instead of trying to check themovement of the french as was desired in petersburg and by the russianarmy generals directed his whole activity here as he had done attarutino and vyazma to hastening it on while easing the movement of ourarmybut besides this since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of thearmy caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident anotherreason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to kutuzovthe aim of the russian army was to pursue the french the road thefrench would take was unknown and so the closer our troops trod ontheir heels the greater distance they had to cover only by following atsome distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the french allthe artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements ofthe army and a lengthening of its marches whereas the only reasonableaim was to shorten those marches to that end kutuzovs activity wasdirected during the whole campaign from moscow to vilnanot casually orintermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from itkutuzov felt and knewnot by reasoning or science but with the whole ofhis russian beingwhat every russian soldier felt that the french werebeaten that the enemy was flying and must be driven out but at thesame time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this marchthe rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the yearbut to the generals especially the foreign ones in the russian armywho wished to distinguish themselves to astonish somebody and for somereason to capture a king or a dukeit seemed that nowwhen any battlemust be horrible and senselesswas the very time to fight and conquersomebody kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after anotherthey presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiersillshod insufficiently clad and half starvedwho within a month andwithout fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number and who atthe best if the flight continued would have to go a greater distancethan they had already traversed before they reached the frontierthis longing to distinguish themselves to maneuver to overthrow andto cut off showed itself particularly whenever the russians stumbled onthe french armyso it was at krasnoe where they expected to find one of the threefrench columns and stumbled instead on napoleon himself with sixteenthousand men despite all kutuzovs efforts to avoid that ruinousencounter and to preserve his troops the massacre of the broken mob offrench soldiers by wornout russians continued at krasnoe for threedaystoll wrote a disposition the first column will march to so and soetc and as usual nothing happened in accord with the dispositionprince eugene of wurttemberg fired from a hill over the french crowdsthat were running past and demanded reinforcements which did notarrive the french avoiding the russians dispersed and hid themselvesin the forest by night making their way round as best they could andcontinued their flightmiloradovich who said he did not want to know anything about thecommissariat affairs of his detachment and could never be found when hewas wantedthat chevalier sans peur et sans reproche  as he styledhimselfwho was fond of parleys with the french sent envoys demandingtheir surrender wasted time and did not do what he was ordered to do knight without fear and without reproachi give you that column lads he said riding up to the troops andpointing out the french to the cavalryand the cavalry with spurs and sabers urging on horses that couldscarcely move trotted with much effort to the column presented to themthat is to say to a crowd of frenchmen stark with cold frostbittenand starvingand the column that had been presented to them threw downits arms and surrendered as it had long been anxious to doat krasnoe they took twentysix thousand prisoners several hundredcannon and a stick called a marshals staff and disputed as to whohad distinguished himself and were pleased with their achievementthough they much regretted not having taken napoleon or at least amarshal or a hero of some sort and reproached one another andespecially kutuzov for having failed to do sothese men carried away by their passions were but blind tools of themost melancholy law of necessity but considered themselves heroes andimagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable deedthey blamed kutuzov and said that from the very beginning of thecampaign he had prevented their vanquishing napoleon that he thought ofnothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from the linenfactories because he was comfortable there that at krasnoe he checkedthe advance because on learning that napoleon was there he had quitelost his head and that it was probable that he had an understandingwith napoleon and had been bribed by him and so on and so onnot only did his contemporaries carried away by their passions talk inthis way but posterity and history have acclaimed napoleon as grandwhile kutuzov is described by foreigners as a crafty dissolute weakold courtier and by russians as something indefinitea sort of puppetuseful only because he had a russian namein  and  kutuzov was openly accused of blundering the emperorwas dissatisfied with him and in a history recently written by order ofthe highest authorities it is said that kutuzov was a cunning courtliar frightened of the name of napoleon and that by his blunders atkrasnoe and the berezina he deprived the russian army of the glory ofcomplete victory over the french  history of the year  the character of kutuzov and reflections onthe unsatisfactory results of the battles at krasnoe by bogdanovichsuch is the fate not of great men grands hommes whom the russian minddoes not acknowledge but of those rare and always solitary individualswho discerning the will of providence submit their personal will toit the hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such men for discerningthe higher lawsfor russian historians strange and terrible to say napoleonthat mostinsignificant tool of history who never anywhere even in exile showedhuman dignitynapoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm he isgrand but kutuzovthe man who from the beginning to the end of hisactivity in  never once swerving by word or deed from borodino tovilna presented an example exceptional in history of selfsacrifice anda present consciousness of the future importance of what was happeningkutuzov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful and whenspeaking of him and of the year  they always seem a little ashamedand yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whoseactivity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim and it would bedifficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the willof the whole people still more difficult would it be to find aninstance in history of the aim of an historical personage being socompletely accomplished as that to which all kutuzovs efforts weredirected in kutuzov never talked of forty centuries looking down from thepyramids of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland or of whathe intended to accomplish or had accomplished in general he saidnothing about himself adopted no pose always appeared to be thesimplest and most ordinary of men and said the simplest and mostordinary things he wrote letters to his daughters and to madame destael read novels liked the society of pretty women jested withgenerals officers and soldiers and never contradicted those who triedto prove anything to him when count rostopchin at the yauza bridgegalloped up to kutuzov with personal reproaches for having caused thedestruction of moscow and said how was it you promised not to abandonmoscow without a battle kutuzov replied and i shall not abandonmoscow without a battle though moscow was then already abandoned whenarakcheev coming to him from the emperor said that ermolov ought to beappointed chief of the artillery kutuzov replied yes i was justsaying so myself though a moment before he had said quite thecontrary what did it matter to himwho then alone amid a senselesscrowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what washappeningwhat did it matter to him whether rostopchin attributed thecalamities of moscow to him or to himself still less could it matter tohim who was appointed chief of the artillerynot merely in these cases but continually did that old manwho byexperience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and thewords serving as their expression are not what move peopleuse quitemeaningless words that happened to enter his headbut that man so heedless of his words did not once during the wholetime of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aimtoward which he moved throughout the whole war obviously in spite ofhimself in very diverse circumstances he repeatedly expressed his realthoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understoodbeginning with the battle of borodino from which time his disagreementwith those about him began he alone said that the battle of borodinowas a victory and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches andreports up to the time of his death he alone said that the loss ofmoscow is not the loss of russia in reply to lauristons proposal ofpeace he said there can be no peace for such is the peoples will healone during the retreat of the french said that all our maneuvers areuseless everything is being accomplished of itself better than we coulddesire that the enemy must be offered a golden bridge that neitherthe tarutino the vyazma nor the krasnoe battles were necessary thatwe must keep some force to reach the frontier with and that he wouldnot sacrifice a single russian for ten frenchmenand this courtier as he is described to us who lies to arakcheev toplease the emperor he aloneincurring thereby the emperorsdispleasuresaid in vilna that to carry the war beyond the frontier isuseless and harmfulnor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of theevents his actionswithout the smallest deviationwere all directedto one and the same threefold end  to brace all his strength forconflict with the french  to defeat them and  to drive them outof russia minimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our peopleand of our armythis procrastinator kutuzov whose motto was patience and time thisenemy of decisive action gave battle at borodino investing thepreparations for it with unparalleled solemnity this kutuzov who beforethe battle of austerlitz began said that it would be lost he alone incontradiction to everyone else declared till his death that borodinowas a victory despite the assurance of generals that the battle waslost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire afterwinning a battle was unprecedented he alone during the whole retreatinsisted that battles which were useless then should not be foughtand that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of russiacrossedit is easy now to understand the significance of these eventsif onlywe abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims thatexisted only in the heads of a dozen individualsfor the events andresults now lie before usbut how did that old man alone in opposition to the general opinionso truly discern the importance of the peoples view of the events thatin all his activity he was never once untrue to itthe source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of theevents then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed infull purity and strengthonly the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling causedthe people in so strange a manner contrary to the tsars wish toselect himan old man in disfavorto be their representative in thenational war and only that feeling placed him on that highest humanpedestal from which he the commanderinchief devoted all his powersnot to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity onthemthat simple modest and therefore truly great figure could not be castin the false mold of a european herothe supposed ruler of menthathistory has inventedto a lackey no man can be great for a lackey has his own conception ofgreatnessthe fifth of november was the first day of what is called the battle ofkrasnoe toward eveningafter much disputing and many mistakes made bygenerals who did not go to their proper places and after adjutants hadbeen sent about with counterorderswhen it had become plain that theenemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be nobattle kutuzov left krasnoe and went to dobroe whither his headquartershad that day been transferredthe day was clear and frosty kutuzov rode to dobroe on his plump littlewhite horse followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals whowhispered among themselves behind his back all along the road groups offrench prisoners captured that day there were seven thousand of themwere crowding to warm themselves at campfires near dobroe an immensecrowd of tattered prisoners buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandagedin anything they had been able to get hold of were standing in the roadbeside a long row of unharnessed french guns at the approach of thecommanderinchief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed onkutuzov who wearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoatthat bulged on his round shoulders moved slowly along the road on hiswhite horse one of the generals was reporting to him where the guns andprisoners had been capturedkutuzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general wassaying he screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazedattentively and fixedly at these prisoners who presented a speciallywretched appearance most of them were disfigured by frostbitten nosesand cheeks and nearly all had red swollen and festering eyesone group of the french stood close to the road and two of them one ofwhom had his face covered with sores were tearing a piece of raw fleshwith their hands there was something horrible and bestial in thefleeting glance they threw at the riders and in the malevolentexpression with which after a glance at kutuzov the soldier with thesores immediately turned away and went on with what he was doingkutuzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers he puckered hisface screwed up his eyes and pensively swayed his head at anotherspot he noticed a russian soldier laughingly patting a frenchman on theshoulder saying something to him in a friendly manner and kutuzov withthe same expression on his face again swayed his headwhat were you saying he asked the general who continuing his reportdirected the commanderinchiefs attention to some standards capturedfrom the french and standing in front of the preobrazhensk regimentah the standards said kutuzov evidently detaching himself withdifficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied himhe looked about him absently thousands of eyes were looking at him fromall sides awaiting a word from himhe stopped in front of the preobrazhensk regiment sighed deeply andclosed his eyes one of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carrying thestandards to advance and surround the commanderinchief with themkutuzov was silent for a few seconds and then submitting with evidentreluctance to the duty imposed by his position raised his head andbegan to speak a throng of officers surrounded him he lookedattentively around at the circle of officers recognizing several ofthemi thank you all he said addressing the soldiers and then again theofficers in the stillness around him his slowly uttered words weredistinctly heard i thank you all for your hard and faithful servicethe victory is complete and russia will not forget you honor to youforeverhe paused and looked aroundlower its head lower it he said to a soldier who had accidentallylowered the french eagle he was holding before the preobrazhenskstandards lower lower thats it hurrah lads he added addressingthe men with a rapid movement of his chinhurrrah roared thousands of voiceswhile the soldiers were shouting kutuzov leaned forward in his saddleand bowed his head and his eye lit up with a mild and apparently ironicgleamyou see brothers said he when the shouts had ceased and all atonce his voice and the expression of his face changed it was no longerthe commanderinchief speaking but an ordinary old man who wanted totell his comrades something very importantthere was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of thesoldiers who moved that they might hear better what he was going tosayyou see brothers i know its hard for you but it cant be helpedbear up it wont be for long now well see our visitors off and thenwell rest the tsar wont forget your service it is hard for you butstill you are at home while theyyou see what they have come to saidhe pointing to the prisoners worse off than our poorest beggarswhile they were strong we didnt spare ourselves but now we may evenpity them they are human beings too isnt it so ladshe looked around and in the direct respectful wondering gaze fixedupon him he read sympathy with what he had said his face grew brighterand brighter with an old mans mild smile which drew the corners of hislips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles he ceased speaking and bowedhis head as if in perplexitybut after all who asked them here serves them right the bloodybastards he cried suddenly lifting his headand flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first timeduring the whole campaign and left the broken ranks of the soldierslaughing joyfully and shouting hurrahkutuzovs words were hardly understood by the troops no one could haverepeated the field marshals address begun solemnly and then changinginto an old mans simplehearted talk but the hearty sincerity of thatspeech the feeling of majestic triumph combined with pity for the foeand consciousness of the justice of our cause exactly expressed by thatold mans goodnatured expletives was not merely understood but lay inthe soul of every soldier and found expression in their joyous and longsustained shouts afterwards when one of the generals addressed kutuzovasking whether he wished his caleche to be sent for kutuzov inanswering unexpectedly gave a sob being evidently greatly movedwhen the troops reached their nights halting place on the eighth ofnovember the last day of the krasnoe battles it was already growingdusk all day it had been calm and frosty with occasional lightlyfalling snow and toward evening it began to clear through the fallingsnow a purpleblack and starry sky showed itself and the frost grewkeeneran infantry regiment which had left tarutino three thousand strong butnow numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that nightat its halting placea village on the highroad the quartermasters whomet the regiment announced that all the huts were full of sick and deadfrenchmen cavalrymen and members of the staff there was only one hutavailable for the regimental commanderthe commander rode up to his hut the regiment passed through thevillage and stacked its arms in front of the last hutslike some huge manylimbed animal the regiment began to prepare itslair and its food one part of it dispersed and waded kneedeep throughthe snow into a birch forest to the right of the village andimmediately the sound of axes and swords the crashing of branches andmerry voices could be heard from there another section amid theregimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busygetting out caldrons and rye biscuit and feeding the horses a thirdsection scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staffofficers carrying out the french corpses that were in the huts anddragging away boards dry wood and thatch from the roofs for thecampfires or wattle fences to serve for sheltersome fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattlewall of a shed the roof of which had already been removednow then all togethershove cried the voices and the huge surfaceof the wall sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost was seenswaying in the gloom of the night the lower stakes cracked more andmore and at last the wall fell and with it the men who had been pushingit loud coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensuednow then catch hold in twos hand up the lever thats it where areyou shoving tonow all together but wait a moment boys with a songall stood silent and a soft pleasant velvety voice began to sing atthe end of the third verse as the last note died away twenty voicesroared out at once oooooooo thats it all together heave awayboys but despite their united efforts the wattle hardly moved andin the silence that followed the heavy breathing of the men was audiblehere you of the sixth company devils that you are lend a handwill you you may want us one of these dayssome twenty men of the sixth company who were on their way into thevillage joined the haulers and the wattle wall which was about thirtyfive feet long and seven feet high moved forward along the villagestreet swaying pressing upon and cutting the shoulders of the gaspingmenget along falling what are you stopping for there nowmerry senseless words of abuse flowed freelywhat are you up to suddenly came the authoritative voice of asergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burdenthere are gentry here the general himself is in that hut and youfoulmouthed devils you brutes ill give it to you shouted hehitting the first man who came in his

wattlethere how that devil hits out hes made my face all bloody said hein a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed ondont you like it said a laughing voice and moderating their tonesthe men moved forwardwhen they were out of the village they began talking again as loud asbefore interlarding their talk with the same aimless expletivesin the hut which the men had passed the chief officers had gathered andwere in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day and themaneuvers suggested for tomorrow it was proposed to make a flank marchto the left cut off the viceking murat and capture himby the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its place thecampfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking the woodcrackled the snow was melting and black shadows of soldiers flitted toand fro all over the occupied space where the snow had been troddendownaxes and choppers were plied all around everything was done without anyorders being given stores of wood were brought for the night shelterswere rigged up for the officers caldrons were being boiled and musketsand accouterments put in orderthe wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by theeighth company as a shelter from the north propped up by musket restsand a campfire was built before it they beat the tattoo called theroll had supper and settled down round the fires for the nightsomerepairing their footgear some smoking pipes and some strippingthemselves naked to steam the lice out of their shirtsone would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretchedconditions the russian soldiers were in at that timelacking warm bootsand sheepskin coats without a roof over their heads in the snow witheighteen degrees of frost and without even full rations thecommissariat did not always keep up with the troopsthey would havepresented a very sad and depressing spectacleon the contrary the army had never under the best material conditionspresented a more cheerful and animated aspect this was because all whobegan to grow depressed or who lost strength were sifted out of the armyday by day all the physically or morally weak had long since been leftbehind and only the flower of the armyphysically and mentallyremainedmore men collected behind the wattle fence of the eighth company thananywhere else two sergeants major were sitting with them and theircampfire blazed brighter than others for leave to sit by their wattlethey demanded contributions of fueleh makeev what has become of you you son of a bitch are you lost orhave the wolves eaten you fetch some

belly gets frozen thats queero lordwhat are you pushing for is the fire only for you look how hessprawlingin the silence that ensued the snoring of those who had fallen asleepcould be heard others turned over and warmed themselves now and againexchanging a few words from a campfire a hundred paces off came a soundof general merry laughterhark at them roaring there in the fifth company said one of thesoldiers and what a lot of them there areone of the men got up and went over to the fifth companytheyre having such fun said he coming back two frenchies haveturned up ones quite frozen and the others an awful swaggerer hessinging songsoh ill go across and have a lookand several of the men went over to the fifth companythe fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the forest a hugecampfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow lighting up thebranches of trees heavy with hoarfrostabout midnight they heard the sound of steps in the snow of the forestand the crackling of dry branchesa bear lads said one of the menthey all raised their heads to listen and out of the forest into thebright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging toone anotherthese were two frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest they came upto the fire hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers didnot understand one was taller than the other he wore an officers hatand seemed quite exhausted on approaching the fire he had been going tosit down but fell the other a short sturdy soldier with a shawl tiedround his head was stronger he raised his companion and saidsomething pointing to his mouth the soldiers surrounded the frenchmenspread a greatcoat on the ground for the sick man and brought somebuckwheat porridge and vodka for both of themthe exhausted french officer was ramballe and the man with his headwrapped in the shawl was morel his orderlywhen morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge hesuddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to thesoldiers who could not understand him ramballe refused food andresting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire looking atthe russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes occasionally he emitted alongdrawn groan and then again became silent morel pointing to hisshoulders tried to impress on the soldiers the fact that ramballe wasan officer and ought to be warmed a russian officer who had come up tothe fire sent to ask his colonel whether he would not take a frenchofficer into his hut to warm him and when the messenger returned andsaid that the colonel wished the officer to be brought to him ramballewas told to go he rose and tried to walk but staggered and would havefallen had not a soldier standing by held him upyou wont do it again eh said one of the soldiers winking andturning mockingly to ramballeoh you fool why talk rubbish lout that you area real peasantcame rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldierthey surrounded ramballe lifted him on the crossed arms of twosoldiers and carried him to the hut ramballe put his arms around theirnecks while they carried him and began wailing plaintivelyoh you fine fellows my kind kind friends these are men oh mybrave kind friends and he leaned his head against the shoulder of oneof the men like a childmeanwhile morel was sitting in the best place by the fire surrounded bythe soldiersmorel a short sturdy frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes waswearing a womans cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round hishead over his cap he was evidently tipsy and was singing a

glance at morel with asmilethey are men too said one of them as he wrapped himself up in hiscoat even wormwood grows on its own rooto lord o lord how starry it is tremendous that means a hardfrostthey all grew silent the stars as if knowing that no one was lookingat them began to disport themselves in the dark sky now flaring upnow vanishing now trembling they were busy whispering somethinggladsome and mysterious to one anotherthe french army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematicalprogression and that crossing of the berezina about which so much hasbeen written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction and notat all the decisive episode of the campaign if so much has been andstill is written about the berezina on the french side this is onlybecause at the broken bridge across that river the calamities their armyhad been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one momentinto a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory and on therussian side merely because in petersburgfar from the seat of waraplan again one of pfuels had been devised to catch napoleon in astrategic trap at the berezina river everyone assured himself that allwould happen according to plan and therefore insisted that it was justthe crossing of the berezina that destroyed the french army in realitythe results of the crossing were much less disastrous to the frenchinguns and men lostthan krasnoe had been as the figures showthe sole importance of the crossing of the berezina lies in the factthat it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans forcutting off the enemys retreat and the soundness of the only possibleline of actionthe one kutuzov and the general mass of the armydemandednamely simply to follow the enemy up the french crowd fledat a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed toreaching its goal it fled like a wounded animal and it was impossibleto block its path this was shown not so much by the arrangements itmade for crossing as by what took place at the bridges when the bridgesbroke down unarmed soldiers people from moscow and women with childrenwho were with the french transport allcarried on by vis inertiaepressed forward into boats and into the icecovered water and did notsurrenderthat impulse was reasonable the condition of fugitives and of pursuerswas equally bad as long as they remained with their own people eachmight hope for help from his fellows and the definite place he heldamong them but those who surrendered while remaining in the samepitiful plight would be on a lower level to claim a share in thenecessities of life the french did not need to be informed of the factthat half the prisonerswith whom the russians did not know what to doperished of cold and hunger despite their captors desire to save themthey felt that it could not be otherwise the most compassionate russiancommanders those favorable to the frenchand even the frenchmen in therussian servicecould do nothing for the prisoners the french perishedfrom the conditions to which the russian army was itself exposed it wasimpossible to take bread and clothes from our hungry and indispensablesoldiers to give to the french who though not harmful or hated orguilty were simply unnecessary some russians even did that but theywere exceptionscertain destruction lay behind the french but in front there was hopetheir ships had been burned there was no salvation save in collectiveflight and on that the whole strength of the french was concentratedthe farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of theremnant especially after the berezina on which in consequence of thepetersburg plan special hopes had been placed by the russians and thekeener grew the passions of the russian commanders who blamed oneanother and kutuzov most of all anticipation that the failure of thepetersburg berezina plan would be attributed to kutuzov led todissatisfaction contempt and ridicule more and more stronglyexpressed the ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in arespectful form making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was toblame they did not talk seriously to him when reporting to him orasking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettableformality but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him atevery turnbecause they could not understand him all these people assumed that itwas useless to talk to the old man that he would never grasp theprofundity of their plans that he would answer with his phrases whichthey thought were mere phrases about a golden bridge about theimpossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalionsand so forth they had heard all that before and all he saidthat itwas necessary to await provisions or that the men had no bootswas sosimple while what they proposed was so complicated and clever that itwas evident that he was old and stupid and that they though not inpower were commanders of geniusafter the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and petersburghero wittgenstein this mood and the gossip of the staff reached theirmaximum kutuzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged his shouldersonly once after the affair of the berezina did he get angry and writeto bennigsen who reported separately to the emperor the followingletteron account of your spells of ill health will your excellency please beso good as to set off for kaluga on receipt of this and there awaitfurther commands and appointments from his imperial majestybut after bennigsens departure the grand duke tsarevich constantinepavlovich joined the army he had taken part in the beginning of thecampaign but had subsequently been removed from the army by kutuzov nowhaving come to the army he informed kutuzov of the emperorsdispleasure at the poor success of our forces and the slowness of theiradvance the emperor intended to join the army personally in a few daystimethe old man experienced in court as well as in military affairsthissame kutuzov who in august had been chosen commanderinchief againstthe sovereigns wishes and who had removed the grand duke and heirapparent from the armywho on his own authority and contrary to theemperors will had decided on the abandonment of moscow now realized atonce that his day was over that his part was played and that the powerhe was supposed to hold was no longer his and he understood this notmerely from the attitude of the court he saw on the one hand that themilitary business in which he had played his part was ended and feltthat his mission was accomplished and at the same time he began to beconscious of the physical weariness of his aged body and of thenecessity of physical reston the twentyninth of november kutuzov entered vilnahis dear vilnaas he called it twice during his career kutuzov had been governor ofvilna in that wealthy town which had not been injured he found oldfriends and associations besides the comforts of life of which he hadso long been deprived and he suddenly turned from the cares of army andstate and as far as the passions that seethed around him allowedimmersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly beenaccustomed as if all that was taking place and all that had still to bedone in the realm of history did not concern him at allchichagov one of the most zealous cuttersoff and breakersup whohad first wanted to effect a diversion in greece and then in warsaw butnever wished to go where he was sent chichagov noted for the boldnesswith which he spoke to the emperor and who considered kutuzov to beunder an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace withturkey in  independently of kutuzov and found that peace hadalready been concluded he admitted to the emperor that the merit ofsecuring that peace was really kutuzovs this chichagov was the firstto meet kutuzov at the castle where the latter was to stay in undressnaval uniform with a dirk and holding his cap under his arm he handedkutuzov a garrison report and the keys of the town the contemptuouslyrespectful attitude of the younger men to the old man in his dotage wasexpressed in the highest degree by the behavior of chichagov who knewof the accusations that were being directed against kutuzovwhen speaking to chichagov kutuzov incidentally mentioned that thevehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at borisovhad been recovered and would be restored to himyou mean to imply that i have nothing to eat out of on thecontrary i can supply you with everything even if you want to givedinner parties warmly replied chichagov who tried by every word hespoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined kutuzov to beanimated by the same desirekutuzov shrugging his shoulders replied with his subtle penetratingsmile i meant merely to say what i saidcontrary to the emperors wish kutuzov detained the greater part of thearmy at vilna those about him said that he became extraordinarily slackand physically feeble during his stay in that town he attended to armyaffairs reluctantly left everything to his generals and while awaitingthe emperors arrival led a dissipated lifehaving left petersburg on the seventh of december with his suitecounttolstoy prince volkonski arakcheev and othersthe emperor reachedvilna on the eleventh and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to thecastle in spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staffofficers in full parade uniform stood in front of the castle as well asa guard of honor of the semenov regimenta courier who galloped to the castle in advance in a troyka with threefoamflecked horses shouted coming and konovnitsyn rushed into thevestibule to inform kutuzov who was waiting in the hall porters littlelodgea minute later the old mans large stout figure in fulldress uniformhis chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomachwaddled out into the porch he put on his hat with its peaks to thesides and holding his gloves in his hand and walking with an effortsideways down the steps to the level of the street took in his hand thereport he had prepared for the emperorthere was running to and fro and whispering another troyka flewfuriously up and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh inwhich the figures of the emperor and volkonski could already bedescriedfrom the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effecton the old general he carefully and hastily felt himself all overreadjusted his hat and pulling himself together drew himself up and atthe very moment when the emperor having alighted from the sleighlifted his eyes to him handed him the report and began speaking in hissmooth ingratiating voicethe emperor with a rapid glance scanned kutuzov from head to footfrowned for an instant but immediately mastering himself went up to theold man extended his arms and embraced him and this embrace too owingto a longstanding impression related to his innermost feelings had itsusual effect on kutuzov and he gave a sobthe emperor greeted the officers and the semenov guard and againpressing the old mans hand went with him into the castlewhen alone with the field marshal the emperor expressed hisdissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes madeat krasnoe and the berezina and informed him of his intentions for afuture campaign abroad kutuzov made no rejoinder or remark the samesubmissive expressionless look with which he had listened to theemperors commands on the field of austerlitz seven years before settledon his face nowwhen kutuzov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossingthe ballroom with his heavy waddling gait he was arrested by someonesvoice sayingyour serene highnesskutuzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes ofcount tolstoy who stood before him holding a silver salver on which laya small object kutuzov seemed not to understand what was expected ofhimsuddenly he seemed to remember a scarcely perceptible smile flashedacross his puffy face and bowing low and respectfully he took theobject that lay on the salver it was the order of st george of thefirst classnext day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the emperorhonored by his presence kutuzov had received the order of st george ofthe first class and the emperor showed him the highest honors buteveryone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him the proprietieswere observed and the emperor was the first to set that example buteverybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and goodfornothing when kutuzov conforming to a custom of catherines dayordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at theemperors feet on his entering the ballroom the emperor made a wry faceand muttered something in which some people caught the words the oldcomedianthe emperors displeasure with kutuzov was specially increased at vilnaby the fact that kutuzov evidently could not or would not understand theimportance of the coming campaignwhen on the following morning the emperor said to the officers assembledabout him you have not only saved russia you have saved europe theyall understood that the war was not endedkutuzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion thatno fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of russiabut could only spoil and lower the glorious position that russia hadgained he tried to prove to the emperor the impossibility of levyingfresh troops spoke of the hardships already endured by the people ofthe possibility of failure and so forththis being the field marshals frame of mind he was naturally regardedas merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending warto avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man the natural method wasto do what had been done with him at austerlitz and with barclay at thebeginning of the russian campaignto transfer the authority to theemperor himself thus cutting the ground from under the commander inchiefs feet without upsetting the old man by informing him of thechangewith this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its realstrength removed and transferred to the emperor toll konovnitsyn andermolov received fresh appointments everyone spoke loudly of the fieldmarshals great weakness and failing healthhis health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given toanother and in fact his health was poorso naturally simply and graduallyjust as he had come from turkey tothe treasury in petersburg to recruit the militia and then to the armywhen he was needed therenow when his part was played out kutuzovsplace was taken by a new and necessary performerthe war of  besides its national significance dear to every russianheart was now to assume another a european significancethe movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by amovement of peoples from east to west and for this fresh war anotherleader was necessary having qualities and views differing fromkutuzovs and animated by different motivesalexander i was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from eastto west and for the refixing of national frontiers as kutuzov had beenfor the salvation and glory of russiakutuzov did not understand what europe the balance of power ornapoleon meant he could not understand it for the representative ofthe russian people after the enemy had been destroyed and russia hadbeen liberated and raised to the summit of her glory there was nothingleft to do as a russian nothing remained for the representative of thenational war but to die and kutuzov diedas generally happens pierre did not feel the full effects of thephysical privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner until afterthey were over after his liberation he reached orel and on the thirdday there when preparing to go to kiev he fell ill and was laid up forthree months he had what the doctors termed bilious fever butdespite the fact that the doctors treated him bled him and gave himmedicines to drink he recoveredscarcely any impression was left on pierres mind by all that happenedto him from the time of his rescue till his illness he remembered onlythe dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy internal physicaldistress and pains in his feet and side he remembered a generalimpression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of beingworried by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him healso remembered his difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses andabove all he remembered his incapacity to think and feel all that timeon the day of his rescue he had seen the body of petya rostov that sameday he had learned that prince andrew after surviving the battle ofborodino for more than a month had recently died in the rostovs houseat yaroslavl and denisov who told him this news also mentioned helenesdeath supposing that pierre had heard of it long before all this atthe time seemed merely strange to pierre he felt he could not grasp itssignificance just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly aspossible from places where people were killing one another to somepeaceful refuge where he could recover himself rest and think over allthe strange new facts he had learned but on reaching orel heimmediately fell ill when he came to himself after his illness he sawin attendance on him two of his servants terenty and vaska who hadcome from moscow and also his cousin the eldest princess who had beenliving on his estate at elets and hearing of his rescue and illness hadcome to look after himit was only gradually during his convalescence that pierre lost theimpressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months andgot used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywheretomorrow that no one would deprive him of his warm bed and that hewould be sure to get his dinner tea and supper but for a long time inhis dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity in thesame way little by little he came to understand the news he had beentold after his rescue about the death of prince andrew the death ofhis wife and the destruction of the frencha joyous feeling of freedomthat complete inalienable freedom naturalto man which he had first experienced at the first halt outside moscowfilled pierres soul during his convalescence he was surprised to findthat this inner freedom which was independent of external conditionsnow had as it were an additional setting of external liberty he wasalone in a strange town without acquaintances no one demanded anythingof him or sent him anywhere he had all he wanted the thought of hiswife which had been a continual torment to him was no longer theresince she was no moreoh how good how splendid said he to himself when a cleanly laidtable was moved up to him with savory beef tea or when he lay down forthe night on a soft clean bed or when he remembered that the french hadgone and that his wife was no more oh how good how splendidand by old habit he asked himself the question well and what thenwhat am i going to do and he immediately gave himself the answerwell i shall live ah how splendidthe very question that had formerly tormented him the thing he hadcontinually sought to findthe aim of lifeno longer existed for himnow that search for the aim of life had not merely disappearedtemporarilyhe felt that it no longer existed for him and could notpresent itself again and this very absence of an aim gave him thecomplete joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness atthis timehe could not see an aim for he now had faithnot faith in any kind ofrule or words or ideas but faith in an everliving evermanifestgod formerly he had sought him in aims he set himself that search foran aim had been simply a search for god and suddenly in his captivityhe had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what hisnurse had told him long ago that god is here and everywhere in hiscaptivity he had learned that in karataev god was greater more infiniteand unfathomable than in the architect of the universe recognized by thefreemasons he felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see intothe far distance finds what he sought at his very feet all his life hehad looked over the heads of the men around him when he should havemerely looked in front of him without straining his eyesin the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutableinfinite something he had only felt that it must exist somewhere andhad looked for it in everything near and comprehensible he had onlywhat was limited petty commonplace and senseless he had equippedhimself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space wherepetty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to himgreat and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen and such hadeuropean life politics freemasonry philosophy and philanthropyseemed to him but even then at moments of weakness as he had accountedthem his mind had penetrated to those distances and he had there seenthe same pettiness worldliness and senselessness now however he hadlearned to see the great eternal and infinite in everything andthereforeto see it and enjoy its contemplationhe naturally threwaway the telescope through which he had till now gazed over mens headsand gladly regarded the everchanging eternally great unfathomableand infinite life around him and the closer he looked the more tranquiland happy he became that dreadful question what for which hadformerly destroyed all his mental edifices no longer existed for himto that question what for a simple answer was now always ready inhis soul because there is a god that god without whose will not onehair falls from a mans headin external ways pierre had hardly changed at all in appearance he wasjust what he used to be as before he was absentminded and seemedoccupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special ofhis own the difference between his former and present self was thatformerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was said to himhe had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly seeking todistinguish something at a distance at present he still forgot what wassaid to him and still did not see what was before his eyes but he nowlooked with a scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at whatwas before him and listened to what was said though evidently seeingand hearing something quite different formerly he had appeared to be akindhearted but unhappy man and so people had been inclined to avoidhim now a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips andsympathy for others shone in his eyes with a questioning look as towhether they were as contented as he was and people felt pleased by hispresencepreviously he had talked a great deal grew excited when he talked andseldom listened now he was seldom carried away in conversation and knewhow to listen so that people readily told him their most intimatesecretsthe princess who had never liked pierre and had been particularlyhostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him afterthe old counts death now after staying a short time in orelwhere shehad come intending to show pierre that in spite of his ingratitude sheconsidered it her duty to nurse himfelt to her surprise and vexationthat she had become fond of him pierre did not in any way seek herapproval he merely studied her with interest formerly she had feltthat he regarded her with indifference and irony and so had shrunk intoherself as she did with others and had shown him only the combative sideof her nature but now he seemed to be trying to understand the mostintimate places of her heart and mistrustfully at first but afterwardsgratefully she let him see the hidden kindly sides of her characterthe most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence moresuccessfully evoking memories of the best times of her youth andshowing sympathy with them yet pierres cunning consisted simply infinding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embitteredhard and in her own way proud princessyes he is a very very kind man when he is not under the influence ofbad people but of people such as myself thought shehis servants tooterenty and vaskain their own way noticed the changethat had taken place in pierre they considered that he had become muchsimpler terenty when he had helped him undress and wished him goodnight often lingered with his masters boots in his hands and clothesover his arm to see whether he would not start a talk and pierrenoticing that terenty wanted a chat generally kept him therewell tell me now how did you get food he would askand terenty would begin talking of the destruction of moscow and of theold count and would stand for a long time holding the clothes andtalking or sometimes listening to pierres stories and then would goout into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master andaffection for himthe doctor who attended pierre and visited him every day though heconsidered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every momentwas of value to suffering humanity would sit for hours with pierretelling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on thecharacters of his patients in general and especially of the ladiesits a pleasure to talk to a man like that he is not like ourprovincials he would saythere were several prisoners from the french army in orel and thedoctor brought one of them a young italian to see pierrethis officer began visiting pierre and the princess used to make fun ofthe tenderness the italian expressed for himthe italian seemed happy only when he could come to see pierre talkwith him tell him about his past his life at home and his love andpour out to him his indignation against the french and especiallyagainst napoleonif all russians are in the least like you it is sacrilege to fightsuch a nation he said to pierre you who have suffered so from thefrench do not even feel animosity toward thempierre had evoked the passionate affection of the italian merely byevoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doingduring the last days of pierres stay in orel his old masonicacquaintance count willarski who had introduced him to the lodge in came to see him willarski was married to a russian heiress whohad a large estate in orel province and he occupied a temporary post inthe commissariat department in that townhearing that bezukhov was in orel willarski though they had never beenintimate came to him with the professions of friendship and intimacythat people who meet in a desert generally express for one anotherwillarski felt dull in orel and was pleased to meet a man of his owncircle and as he supposed of similar interestsbut to his surprise willarski soon noticed that pierre had lagged muchbehind the times and had sunk as he expressed it to himself intoapathy and egotismyou are letting yourself go my dear fellow he saidbut for all that willarski found it pleasanter now than it had beenformerly to be with pierre and came to see him every day to pierre ashe looked at and listened to willarski it seemed strange to think thathe had been like that himself but a short time beforewillarski was a married man with a family busy with his family affairshis wifes affairs and his official duties he regarded all theseoccupations as hindrances to life and considered that they were allcontemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and hisfamily military administrative political and masonic interestscontinually absorbed his attention and pierre without trying to changethe others views and without condemning him but with the quietjoyful and amused smile now habitual to him was interested in thisstrange though very familiar phenomenonthere was a new feature in pierres relations with willarski with theprincess with the doctor and with all the people he now met whichgained for him the general good will this was his acknowledgment of theimpossibility of changing a mans convictions by words and hisrecognition of the possibility of everyone thinking feeling and seeingthings each from his own point of view this legitimate peculiarity ofeach individual which used to excite and irritate pierre now became abasis of the sympathy he felt for and the interest he took in otherpeople the difference and sometimes complete contradiction betweenmens opinions and their lives and between one man and another pleasedhim and drew from him an amused and gentle smilein practical matters pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center ofgravity he had previously lacked formerly all pecuniary questionsespecially requests for money to which as an extremely wealthy man hewas very exposed produced in him a state of hopeless agitation andperplexity to give or not to give he had asked himself i have itand he needs it but someone else needs it still more who needs itmost and perhaps they are both impostors in the old days he had beenunable to find a way out of all these surmises and had given to all whoasked as long as he had anything to give formerly he had been in asimilar state of perplexity with regard to every question concerning hisproperty when one person advised one thing and another something elsenow to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt orperplexity about these questions there was now within him a judge whoby some rule unknown to him decided what should or should not be donehe was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters but now he feltcertain of what ought and what ought not to be done the first time hehad recourse to his new judge was when a french prisoner a colonelcame to him and after talking a great deal about his exploitsconcluded by making what amounted to a demand that pierre should givehim four thousand francs to send to his wife and children pierrerefused without the least difficulty or effort and was afterwardssurprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear soinsurmountably difficult at the same time that he refused the colonelsdemand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to artifice whenleaving orel to induce the italian officer to accept some money ofwhich he was evidently in need a further proof to pierre of his ownmore settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decisionwith regard to his wifes debts and to the rebuilding of his houses inand near moscowhis head steward came to him at orel and pierre reckoned up with him hisdiminished income the burning of moscow had cost him according to thehead stewards calculation about two million rublesto console pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an estimateshowing that despite these losses his income would not be diminished butwould even be increased if he refused to pay his wifes debts which hewas under no obligation to meet and did not rebuild his moscow houseand the country house on his moscow estate which had cost him eightythousand rubles a year and brought in nothingyes of course thats true said pierre with a cheerful smile idont need all that at all by being ruined i have become much richerbut in january savelich came from moscow and gave him an account of thestate of things there and spoke of the estimate an architect had madeof the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses speaking of thisas of a settled matter about the same time he received letters fromprince vasili and other petersburg acquaintances speaking of his wifesdebts and pierre decided that the stewards proposals which had sopleased him were wrong and that he must go to petersburg and settle hiswifes affairs and must rebuild in moscow why this was necessary he didnot know but he knew for certain that it was necessary his incomewould be reduced by three fourths but he felt it must be donewillarski was going to moscow and they agreed to travel togetherduring the whole time of his convalescence in orel pierre hadexperienced a feeling of joy freedom and life but when during hisjourney he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of newfaces that feeling was intensified throughout his journey he felt likea schoolboy on holiday everyonethe stagecoach driver the posthouseoverseers the peasants on the roads and in the villageshad a newsignificance for him the presence and remarks of willarski whocontinually deplored the ignorance and poverty of russia and itsbackwardness compared with europe only heightened pierres pleasurewhere willarski saw deadness pierre saw an extraordinary strength andvitalitythe strength which in that vast space amid the snowsmaintained the life of this original peculiar and unique people hedid not contradict willarski and even seemed to agree with himanapparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions thatcould lead to nothingand he smiled joyfully as he listened to himit would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap hasbeen destroyed are hurrying some from the heap dragging bits ofrubbish larvae and corpses others back to the heap or why theyjostle overtake one another and fight and it would be equallydifficult to explain what caused the russians after the departure of thefrench to throng to the place that had formerly been moscow but when wewatch the ants round their ruined heap the tenacity energy andimmense number of the delving insects prove that despite the destructionof the heap something indestructible which though intangible is thereal strength of the colony still exists and similarly though inmoscow in the month of october there was no government and no churchesshrines riches or housesit was still the moscow it had been inaugust all was destroyed except something intangible yet powerful andindestructiblethe motives of those who thronged from all sides to moscow after it hadbeen cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal and at firstfor the most part savage and brutal one motive only they all had incommon a desire to get to the place that had been called moscow toapply their activities therewithin a week moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants in afortnight twentyfive thousand and so on by the autumn of  thenumber ever increasing and increasing exceeded what it had been inthe first russians to enter moscow were the cossacks of wintzingerodesdetachment peasants from the adjacent villages and residents who hadfled from moscow and had been hiding in its vicinity the russians whoentered moscow finding it plundered plundered it in their turn theycontinued what the french had begun trains of peasant carts came tomoscow to carry off to the villages what had been abandoned in theruined houses and the streets the cossacks carried off what they couldto their camps and the householders seized all they could find in otherhouses and moved it to their own pretending that it was their propertybut the first plunderers were followed by a second and a thirdcontingent and with increasing numbers plundering became more and moredifficult and assumed more definite formsthe french found moscow abandoned but with all the organizations ofregular life with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship withluxury and governmental and religious institutions these forms werelifeless but still existed there were bazaars shops warehousesmarket stalls granariesfor the most part still stocked with goodsand there were factories and workshops palaces and wealthy housesfilled with luxuries hospitals prisons government offices churchesand cathedrals the longer the french remained the more these forms oftown life perished until finally all was merged into one confusedlifeless scene of plunderthe more the plundering by the french continued the more both thewealth of moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed butplundering by the russians with which the reoccupation of the citybegan had an opposite effect the longer it continued and the greaterthe number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealthof the city and its regular life restoredbesides the plunderers very various people some drawn by curiositysome by official duties some by selfinteresthouse owners clergyofficials of all kinds tradesmen artisans and peasantsstreamed intomoscow as blood flows to the heartwithin a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry offplunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses outof the town other peasants having heard of their comradesdiscomfiture came to town bringing rye oats and hay and beat downone anothers prices to below what they had been in former days gangsof carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in moscow every day and onall sides logs were being hewn new houses built and old charred onesrepaired tradesmen began trading in booths cookshops and taverns wereopened in partially burned houses the clergy resumed the services inmany churches that had not been burned donors contributed churchproperty that had been stolen government clerks set up their baizecovered tables and their pigeonholes of documents in small rooms thehigher authorities and the police organized the distribution of goodsleft behind by the french the owners of houses in which much propertyhad been left brought there from other houses complained of theinjustice of taking everything to the faceted palace in the kremlinothers insisted that as the french had gathered things from differenthouses into this or that house it would be unfair to allow its owner tokeep all that was found there they abused the police and bribed themmade out estimates at ten times their value for government stores thathad perished in the fire and demanded relief and count rostopchinwrote proclamationsat the end of january pierre went to moscow and stayed in an annex ofhis house which had not been burned he called on count rostopchin andon some acquaintances who were back in moscow and he intended to leavefor petersburg two days later everybody was celebrating the victoryeverything was bubbling with life in the ruined but reviving cityeveryone was pleased to see pierre everyone wished to meet him andeveryone questioned him about what he had seen pierre felt particularlywell disposed toward them all but was now instinctively on his guardfor fear of binding himself in any way to all questions put to himwhether important or quite triflingsuch as where would he live washe going to rebuild when was he going to petersburg and would he mindtaking a parcel for someonehe replied yes perhaps or i thinkso and so onhe had heard that the rostovs were at kostroma but the thought ofnatasha seldom occurred to him if it did it was only as a pleasantmemory of the distant past he felt himself not only free from socialobligations but also from that feeling which it seemed to him he hadaroused in himselfon the third day after his arrival he heard from the drubetskoys thatprincess mary was in moscow the death sufferings and last days ofprince andrew had often occupied pierres thoughts and now recurred tohim with fresh vividness having heard at dinner that princess mary wasin moscow and living in her housewhich had not been burnedinvozdvizhenka street he drove that same evening to see heron his way to the house pierre kept thinking of prince andrew of theirfriendship of his various meetings with him and especially of the lastone at borodinois it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then inis it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him beforehe died thought pierre he recalled karataev and his death andinvoluntarily began to compare these two men so different and yet sosimilar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love hefelt for both of thempierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious moodthe house had escaped the fire it showed signs of damage but itsgeneral aspect was unchanged the old footman who met pierre with astern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence ofthe old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the houseinformed him that the princess had gone to her own apartments and thatshe received on sundaysannounce me perhaps she will see me said pierreyes sir said the man please step into the portrait gallerya few minutes later the footman returned with dessalles who broughtword from the princess that she would be very glad to see pierre if hewould excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartmentin a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with heranother person dressed in black pierre remembered that the princessalways had lady companions but who they were and what they were like henever knew or remembered this must be one of her companions hethought glancing at the lady in the black dressthe princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her handyes she said looking at his altered face after he had kissed herhand so this is how we meet again he spoke of you even at the verylast she went on turning her eyes from pierre to her companion with ashyness that surprised him for an instanti was so glad to hear of your safety it was the first piece of goodnews we had received for a long timeagain the princess glanced round at her companion with even moreuneasiness in her manner and was about to add something but pierreinterrupted herjust imaginei knew nothing about him said he i thought he hadbeen killed all i know i heard at second hand from others i only knowthat he fell in with the rostovs what a strange coincidencepierre spoke rapidly and with animation he glanced once at thecompanions face saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him andas often happens when one is talking felt somehow that this companionin the black dress was a good kind excellent creature who would nothinder his conversing freely with princess marybut when he mentioned the rostovs princess marys face expressed stillgreater embarrassment she again glanced rapidly from pierres face tothat of the lady in the black dress and saiddo you really not recognize herpierre looked again at the companions pale delicate face with itsblack eyes and peculiar mouth and something near to him long forgottenand more than sweet looked at him from those attentive eyesbut no it cant be he thought this stern thin pale face thatlooks so much older it cannot be she it merely reminds me of her butat that moment princess mary said natasha and with difficultyeffort and stress like the opening of a door grown rusty on itshinges a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes and fromthat opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused pierre witha happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even beenthinkingespecially at that moment it suffused him seized him andenveloped him completely when she smiled doubt was no longer possibleit was natasha and he loved herat that moment pierre involuntarily betrayed to her to princess maryand above all to himself a secret of which he himself had been unawarehe flushed joyfully yet with painful distress he tried to hide hisagitation but the more he tried to hide it the more clearlyclearerthan any words could have donedid he betray to himself to her and toprincess mary that he loved herno its only the unexpectedness of it thought pierre but as soon ashe tried to continue the conversation he had begun with princess mary heagain glanced at natasha and a stilldeeper flush suffused his face anda stillstronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul hebecame confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he wassayingpierre had failed to notice natasha because he did not at all expect tosee her there but he had failed to recognize her because the change inher since he last saw her was immense she had grown thin and pale butthat was not what made her unrecognizable she was unrecognizable at themoment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone witha suppressed smile of the joy of life now when he first entered andglanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile only her eyeswere kindly attentive and sadly interrogativepierres confusion was not reflected by any confusion on natashas partbut only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole faceshe has come to stay with me said princess mary the count andcountess will be here in a few days the countess is in a dreadfulstate but it was necessary for natasha herself to see a doctor theyinsisted on her coming with meyes is there a family free from sorrow now said pierre addressingnatasha you know it happened the very day we were rescued i saw himwhat a delightful boy he wasnatasha looked at him and by way of answer to his words her eyeswidened and lit upwhat can one say or think of as a consolation said pierre nothingwhy had such a splendid boy so full of life to dieyes in these days it would be hard to live without faith remarkedprincess maryyes yes that is really true pierre hastily interrupted herwhy is it true natasha asked looking attentively into pierres eyeshow can you ask why said princess mary the thought alone of whatawaitsnatasha without waiting for princess mary to finish again lookedinquiringly at pierreand because pierre continued only one who believes that there is agod ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and yoursnatasha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stoppedpierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed princess maryasking about his friends last dayspierres confusion had now almost vanished but at the same time he feltthat his freedom had also completely gone he felt that there was now ajudge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to himthan that of all the rest of the world as he spoke now he wasconsidering what impression his words would make on natasha he did notpurposely say things to please her but whatever he was saying heregarded from her standpointprincess maryreluctantly as is usual in such casesbegan telling ofthe condition in which she had found prince andrew but pierres facequivering with emotion his questions and his eager restless expressiongradually compelled her to go into details which she feared to recallfor her own sakeyes yes and so pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her withhis whole body and eagerly listened to her story yes yes so hegrew tranquil and softened with all his soul he had always sought onethingto be perfectly goodso he could not be afraid of death thefaults he hadif he had anywere not of his making so he didsoften what a happy thing that he saw you again he added suddenlyturning to natasha and looking at her with eyes full of tearsnatashas face twitched she frowned and lowered her eyes for a momentshe hesitated for an instant whether to speak or notyes that was happiness she then said in her quiet voice with itsdeep chest notes for me it certainly was happiness she paused andhe he he said he was wishing for it at the very moment i enteredthe roomnatashas voice broke she blushed pressed her clasped hands on herknees and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted herhead and began to speak rapidlywe knew nothing of it when we started from moscow i did not dare toask about him then suddenly sonya told me he was traveling with us ihad no idea and could not imagine what state he was in all i wanted wasto see him and be with him she said trembling and breathing quicklyand not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she hadnever yet mentioned to anyoneall she had lived through during thosethree weeks of their journey and life at yaroslavlpierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full oftears as he listened he did not think of prince andrew nor of deathnor of what she was telling he listened to her and felt only pity forher for what she was suffering now while she was speakingprincess mary frowning in her effort to hold back her tears sat besidenatasha and heard for the first time the story of those last days ofher brothers and natashas loveevidently natasha needed to tell that painful yet joyful taleshe spoke mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets ofher soul and it seemed as if she could never finish several times sherepeated the same thing twicedessalles voice was heard outside the door asking whether littlenicholas might come in to say good nightwell thats alleverything said natashashe got up quickly just as nicholas entered almost ran to the doorwhich was hidden by curtains struck her head against it and rushedfrom the room with a moan either of pain or sorrowpierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did notunderstand why he suddenly felt all alone in the worldprincess mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attentionto her nephew who had entered the roomat that moment of emotional tenderness young nicholas face whichresembled his fathers affected pierre so much that when he had kissedthe boy he got up quickly took out his handkerchief and went to thewindow he wished to take leave of princess mary but she would not lethim gono natasha and i sometimes dont go to sleep till after two so pleasedont go i will order supper go downstairs we will come immediatelybefore pierre left the room princess mary told him this is the firsttime she has talked of him like thatpierre was shown into the large brightly lit dining room a few minuteslater he heard footsteps and princess mary entered with natasha natashawas calm though a severe and grave expression had again settled on herface they all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardnesswhich usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk it isimpossible to go back to the same conversation to talk of trifles isawkward and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems likeaffectation they went silently to table the footmen drew back thechairs and pushed them up again pierre unfolded his cold table napkinand resolving to break the silence looked at natasha and at princessmary they had evidently both formed the same resolution the eyes ofboth shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow lifealso has joydo you take vodka count asked princess mary and those wordssuddenly banished the shadows of the past now tell us about yourselfsaid she one hears such improbable wonders about youyes replied pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to himthey even tell me wonders i myself never dreamed of mary abramovnainvited me to her house and kept telling me what had happened or oughtto have happened to me stepan stepanych also instructed me how i oughtto tell of my experiences in general i have noticed that it is veryeasy to be an interesting man i am an interesting man now peopleinvite me out and tell me all about myselfnatasha smiled and was on the point of speakingwe have been told princess mary interrupted her that you lost twomillions in moscow is that truebut i am three times as rich as before returned pierrethough the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wifesdebts and to rebuild his houses pierre still maintained that he hadbecome three times as rich as beforewhat i have certainly gained is freedom he began seriously but didnot continue noticing that this theme was too egotisticand are you buildingyes savelich says i musttell me you did not know of the countess death when you decided toremain in moscow asked princess mary and immediately blushed noticingthat her question following his mention of freedom ascribed to hiswords a meaning he had perhaps not intendedno answered pierre evidently not considering awkward the meaningprincess mary had given to his words i heard of it in orel and youcannot imagine how it shocked me we were not an exemplary couple headded quickly glancing at natasha and noticing on her face curiosity asto how he would speak of his wife but her death shocked me terriblywhen two people quarrel they are always both in fault and ones ownguilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longeralive and then such a death without friends and without consolationi am very very sorry for her he concluded and was pleased to noticea look of glad approval on natashas faceyes and so you are once more an eligible bachelor said princessmarypierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look atnatasha when he ventured to glance her way again her face was coldstern and he fancied even contemptuousand did you really see and speak to napoleon as we have been toldsaid princess marypierre laughedno not once everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisonermeans being napoleons guest not only did i never see him but i heardnothing about himi was in much lower companysupper was over and pierre who at first declined to speak about hiscaptivity was gradually led on to do sobut its true that you remained in moscow to kill napoleon natashaasked with a slight smile i guessed it then when we met at thesukharev tower do you rememberpierre admitted that it was true and from that was gradually led byprincess marys questions and especially by natashas into giving adetailed account of his adventuresat first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with himtoward everybody and especially toward himself but when he came todescribe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he wasunconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressedemotion of a man reexperiencing in recollection strong impressions hehas lived throughprincess mary with a gentle smile looked now at pierre and now atnatasha in the whole narrative she saw only pierre and his goodnessnatasha leaning on her elbow the expression of her face constantlychanging with the narrative watched pierre with an attention that neverwanderedevidently herself experiencing all that he described not onlyher look but her exclamations and the brief questions she put showedpierre that she understood just what he wished to convey it was clearthat she understood not only what he said but also what he wished tobut could not express in words the account pierre gave of the incidentwith the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested wasthis it was an awful sightchildren abandoned some in the flamesone was snatched out before my eyes and there were women who hadtheir things snatched off and their earrings torn out he flushed andgrew confused then a patrol arrived and all the menall those whowere not looting that iswere arrested and i among themi am sure youre not telling us everything i am sure you didsomething said natasha and pausing added something finepierre continued when he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass overthe horrible details but natasha insisted that he should not omitanythingpierre began to tell about karataev but paused by this time he hadrisen from the table and was pacing the room natasha following him withher eyes then he addedno you cant understand what i learned from that illiterate manthatsimple fellowyes yes go on said natasha where is hethey killed him almost before my eyesand pierre his voice trembling continually went on to tell of the lastdays of their retreat of karataevs illness and his deathhe told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them he now asit were saw a new meaning in all he had gone through now that he wastelling it all to natasha he experienced that pleasure which a man haswhen women listen to himnot clever women who when listening either tryto remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunityoffers to retell it or who wish to adopt it to some thought of theirown and promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in theirlittle mental workshopbut the pleasure given by real women gifted witha capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himselfnatasha without knowing it was all attention she did not lose a wordno single quiver in pierres voice no look no twitch of a muscle inhis face nor a single gesture she caught the unfinished word in itsflight and took it straight into her open heart divining the secretmeaning of all pierres mental travailprincess mary understood his story and sympathized with him but she nowsaw something else that absorbed all her attention she saw thepossibility of love and happiness between natasha and pierre and thefirst thought of this filled her heart with gladnessit was three oclock in the morning the footmen came in with sad andstern faces to change the candles but no one noticed thempierre finished his story natasha continued to look at him intentlywith bright attentive and animated eyes as if trying to understandsomething more which he had perhaps left untold pierre in shamefacedand happy confusion glanced occasionally at her and tried to think whatto say next to introduce a fresh subject princess mary was silent itoccurred to none of them that it was three oclock and time to go tobedpeople speak of misfortunes and sufferings remarked pierre but ifat this moment i were asked would you rather be what you were beforeyou were taken prisoner or go through all this again then forheavens sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh we imaginethat when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost but it isonly then that what is new and good begins while there is life there ishappiness there is much much before us i say this to you he addedturning to natashayes yes she said answering something quite different i too shouldwish nothing but to relive it all from the beginningpierre looked intently at heryes and nothing more said natashaits not true not true cried pierre i am not to blame for beingalive and wishing to livenor you eithersuddenly natasha bent her head covered her face with her hands andbegan to crywhat is it natasha said princess marynothing nothing she smiled at pierre through her tears good nightit is time for bedpierre rose and took his leaveprincess mary and natasha met as usual in the bedroom they talked ofwhat pierre had told them princess mary did not express her opinion ofpierre nor did natasha speak of himwell good night mary said natasha do you know i am often afraidthat by not speaking of him she meant prince andrew for fear of notdoing justice to our feelings we forget himprincess mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice ofnatashas remark but she did not express agreement in wordsis it possible to forget said sheit did me so much good to tell all about it today it was hard andpainful but good very good said natasha i am sure he really lovedhim that is why i told him was it all right she added suddenlyblushingto tell pierre oh yes what a splendid man he is said princessmarydo you know mary natasha suddenly said with a mischievous smilesuch as princess mary had not seen on her face for a long time he hassomehow grown so clean smooth and freshas if he had just come out ofa russian bath do you understand out of a moral bath isnt it trueyes replied princess mary he has greatly improvedwith a short coat and his hair cropped just as if well just as if hehad come straight from the bath papa used toi understand why he prince andrew liked no one so much as himsaid princess maryyes and yet he is quite different they say men are friends when theyare quite different that must be true really he is quite unlike himin everythingyes but hes wonderfulwell good night said natashaand the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face asif it had been forgotten thereit was a long time before pierre could fall asleep that night he pacedup and down his room now turning his thoughts on a difficult problemand frowning now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing and nowsmiling happilyhe was thinking of prince andrew of natasha and of their love at onemoment jealous of her past then reproaching himself for that feelingit was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down theroomwell whats to be done if it cannot be avoided whats to be doneevidently it has to be so said he to himself and hastily undressinghe got into bed happy and agitated but free from hesitation orindecisionstrange and impossible as such happiness seems i must do everythingthat she and i may be man and wife he told himselfa few days previously pierre had decided to go to petersburg on thefriday when he awoke on the thursday savelich came to ask him aboutpacking for the journeywhat to petersburg what is petersburg who is there in petersburghe asked involuntarily though only to himself oh yes long agobefore this happened i did for some reason mean to go to petersburg hereflected why but perhaps i shall go what a good fellow he is andhow attentive and how he remembers everything he thought looking atsavelichs old face and what a pleasant smile he haswell savelich do you still not wish to accept your freedom pierreasked himwhats the good of freedom to me your excellency we lived under thelate countthe kingdom of heaven be hisand we have lived under youtoo without ever being wrongedand your childrenthe children will live just the same with such masters one can livebut what about my heirs said pierre supposing i suddenly marryit might happen he added with an involuntary smileif i may take the liberty your excellency it would be a good thinghow easy he thinks it thought pierre he doesnt know how terribleit is and how dangerous too soon or too late it is terribleso what are your orders are you starting tomorrow asked savelichno ill put it off for a bit ill tell you later you must forgivethe trouble i have put you to said pierre and seeing savelich smilehe thought but how strange it is that he should not know that nowthere is no petersburg for me and that that must be settled first ofall but probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending shalli have a talk with him and see what he thinks pierre reflected noanother timeat breakfast pierre told the princess his cousin that he had been tosee princess mary the day before and had there metwhom do you thinknatasha rostovathe princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if hehad seen anna semenovnado you know her asked pierrei have seen the princess she replied i heard that they werearranging a match for her with young rostov it would be a very goodthing for the rostovs they are said to be utterly ruinedno i mean do you know natasha rostovai heard about that affair of hers at the time it was a great pityno she either doesnt understand or is pretending thought pierrebetter not say anything to her eitherthe princess too had prepared provisions for pierres journeyhow kind they all are thought pierre what is surprising is thatthey should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be ofinterest to them and all for meon the same day the chief of police came to pierre inviting him to senda representative to the faceted palace to recover things that were to bereturned to their owners that dayand this man too thought pierre looking into the face of the chiefof police what a fine goodlooking officer and how kind fancybothering about such trifles now and they actually say he is not honestand takes bribes what nonsense besides why shouldnt he take bribesthats the way he was brought up and everybody does it but what akind pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at mepierre went to princess marys to dinneras he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burneddown he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins the picturesquenessof the chimney stacks and tumbledown walls of the burnedout quartersof the town stretching out and concealing one another reminded him ofthe rhine and the colosseum the cabmen he met and their passengers thecarpenters cutting the timber for new houses with axes the womenhawkers and the shopkeepers all looked at him with cheerful beamingeyes that seemed to say ah there he is lets see what will come ofitat the entrance to princess marys house pierre felt doubtful whether hehad really been there the night before and really seen natasha andtalked to her perhaps i imagined it perhaps i shall go in and find noone there but he had hardly entered the room before he felt herpresence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom shewas in the same black dress with soft folds and her hair was done thesame way as the day before yet she was quite different had she beenlike this when he entered the day before he could not for a moment havefailed to recognize hershe was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as princeandrews fiancee a bright questioning light shone in her eyes and onher face was a friendly and strangely roguish expressionpierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there butprincess mary was going to vespers and pierre left the house with hernext day he came early dined and stayed the whole evening thoughprincess mary and natasha were evidently glad to see their visitor andthough all pierres interest was now centered in that house by theevening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed fromone trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off he stayed so longthat princess mary and natasha exchanged glances evidently wonderingwhen he would go pierre noticed this but could not go he felt uneasyand embarrassed but sat on because he simply could not get up and takehis leaveprincess mary foreseeing no end to this rose first and complaining ofa headache began to say good nightso you are going to petersburg tomorrow she askedno i am not going pierre replied hastily in a surprised tone and asthough offended yes no to petersburg tomorrowbut i wont saygoodby yet i will call round in case you have any commissions for mesaid he standing before princess mary and turning red but not takinghis departurenatasha gave him her hand and went out princess mary on the other handinstead of going away sank into an armchair and looked sternly andintently at him with her deep radiant eyes the weariness she hadplainly shown before had now quite passed off with a deep and longdrawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talkwhen natasha left the room pierres confusion and awkwardnessimmediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement he quicklymoved an armchair toward princess maryyes i wanted to tell you said he answering her look as if she hadspoken princess help me what am i to do can i hope princess mydear friend listen i know it all i know i am not worthy of her iknow its impossible to speak of it now but i want to be a brother toher no not that i dont i canthe paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his handswell he went on with an evident effort at selfcontrol and coherencei dont know when i began to love her but i have loved her and heralone all my life and i love her so that i cannot imagine life withouther i cannot propose to her at present but the thought that perhapsshe might someday be my wife and that i may be missing thatpossibility that possibility is terrible tell me can i hopetell me what i am to do dear princess he added after a pause andtouched her hand as she did not replyi am thinking of what you have told me answered princess mary thisis what i will say you are right that to speak to her of love atpresentprincess mary stopped she was going to say that to speak of love wasimpossible but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change innatasha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if pierrespoke of his love but that it was the very thing she wished forto speak to her now wouldnt do said the princess all the samebut what am i to doleave it to me said princess mary i knowpierre was looking into princess marys eyeswell well he saidi know that she loves will love you princess mary correctedherselfbefore her words were out pierre had sprung up and with a frightenedexpression seized princess marys handwhat makes you think so you think i may hope you thinkyes i think so said princess mary with a smile write to herparents and leave it to me i will tell her when i can i wish it tohappen and my heart tells me it willno it cannot be how happy i am but it cant be how happy i amno it cant be pierre kept saying as he kissed princess marys handsgo to petersburg that will be best and i will write to you shesaidto petersburg go there very well ill go but i may come againtomorrownext day pierre came to say goodby natasha was less animated than shehad been the day before but that day as he looked at her pierresometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor sheexisted any longer that nothing existed but happiness is it possibleno it cant be he told himself at every look gesture and word thatfilled his soul with joywhen on saying goodby he took her thin slender hand he could not helpholding it a little longer in his ownis it possible that this hand that face those eyes all this treasureof feminine charm so strange to me now is it possible that it will oneday be mine forever as familiar to me as i am to myself no thatsimpossiblegoodbye count she said aloud i shall look forward very much toyour return she added in a whisperand these simple words her look and the expression on her face whichaccompanied them formed for two months the subject of inexhaustiblememories interpretations and happy meditations for pierre i shalllook forward very much to your return yes yes how did she say ityes i shall look forward very much to your return oh how happy iam what is happening to me how happy i am said pierre to himselfthere was nothing in pierres soul now at all like what had troubled itduring his courtship of helenehe did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the wordshe had spoken or say oh why did i not say that and whatever mademe say je vous aime on the contrary he now repeated in imaginationevery word that he or natasha had spoken and pictured every detail ofher face and smile and did not wish to diminish or add anything butonly to repeat it again and again there was now not a shadow of doubtin his mind as to whether what he had undertaken was right or wrongonly one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind wasnt it all adream isnt princess mary mistaken am i not too conceited and selfconfident i believe all thisand suddenly princess mary will tell herand she will be sure to smile and say how strange he must be deludinghimself doesnt he know that he is a man just a man while i i amsomething altogether different and higherthat was the only doubt often troubling pierre he did not now make anyplans the happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if onlyhe could attain it it would be the end of all things everything endedwith thata joyful unexpected frenzy of which he had thought himself incapablepossessed him the whole meaning of lifenot for him alone but for thewhole worldseemed to him centered in his love and the possibility ofbeing loved by her at times everybody seemed to him to be occupied withone thing onlyhis future happiness sometimes it seemed to him thatother people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried tohide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests inevery word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness he oftensurprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles whichseemed to express a secret understanding between him and them and whenhe realized that people might not be aware of his happiness he pitiedthem with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to themthat all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy ofattentionwhen it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service orwhen the war or any general political affairs were discussed on theassumption that everybodys welfare depended on this or that issue ofevents he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and surprisepeople by his strange comments but at this time he saw everybodyboththose who as he imagined understood the real meaning of life that iswhat he was feeling and those unfortunates who evidently did notunderstand itin the bright light of the emotion that shone withinhimself and at once without any effort saw in everyone he meteverything that was good and worthy of being lovedwhen dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife her memoryaroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the bliss henow knew prince vasili who having obtained a new post and some freshdecorations was particularly proud at this time seemed to him apathetic kindly old man much to be pitiedoften in afterlife pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity allthe views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained truefor him always he not only did not renounce them subsequently but whenhe was in doubt or inwardly at variance he referred to the views he hadheld at this time of his madness and they always proved correcti may have appeared strange and queer then he thought but i was notso mad as i seemed on the contrary i was then wiser and had moreinsight than at any other time and understood all that is worthunderstanding in life because because i was happypierres insanity consisted in not waiting as he used to do todiscover personal attributes which he termed good qualities in peoplebefore loving them his heart was now overflowing with love and byloving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes for lovingthemafter pierres departure that first evening when natasha had said toprincess mary with a gaily mocking smile he looks just yes just asif he had come out of a russian bathin a short coat and with his haircropped something hidden and unknown to herself but irrepressibleawoke in natashas souleverything her face walk look and voice was suddenly altered toher own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to thesurface and demanded satisfaction from that evening she seemed to haveforgotten all that had happened to her she no longer complained of herposition did not say a word about the past and no longer feared tomake happy plans for the future she spoke little of pierre but whenprincess mary mentioned him a longextinguished light once more kindledin her eyes and her lips curved with a strange smilethe change that took place in natasha at first surprised princess marybut when she understood its meaning it grieved her can she have lovedmy brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon she thoughtwhen she reflected on the change but when she was with natasha she wasnot vexed with her and did not reproach her the reawakened power oflife that had seized natasha was so evidently irrepressible andunexpected by her that in her presence princess mary felt that she hadno right to reproach her even in her heartnatasha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling thatshe did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad but brightand cheerfulwhen princess mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk withpierre natasha met her on the thresholdhe has spoken yes he has spoken she repeatedand a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness forher joy settled on natashas facei wanted to listen at the door but i knew you would tell meunderstandable and touching as the look with which natasha gazed at herseemed to princess mary and sorry as she was to see her agitationthese words pained her for a moment she remembered her brother and hislovebut whats to be done she cant help it thought the princessand with a sad and rather stern look she told natasha all that pierrehad said on hearing that he was going to petersburg natasha wasastoundedto petersburg she repeated as if unable to understandbut noticing the grieved expression on princess marys face she guessedthe reason of that sadness and suddenly began to crymary said she tell me what i should do i am afraid of being badwhatever you tell me i will do tell meyou love himyes whispered natashathen why are you crying i am happy for your sake said princess marywho because of those tears quite forgave natashas joyit wont be just yetsomeday think what fun it will be when i am hiswife and you marry nicholasnatasha i have asked you not to speak of that let us talk about youthey were silent awhilebut why go to petersburg natasha suddenly asked and hastily repliedto her own question but no no he must yes mary he mustfirst epilogue   seven years had passed the stormtossed sea of european history hadsubsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm but themysterious forces that move humanity mysterious because the laws oftheir motion are unknown to us continued to operatethough the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless the movementof humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time various groupsof people formed and dissolved the coming formation and dissolution ofkingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of preparationthe sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to shore aspreviously it was seething in its depths historic figures were notborne by the waves from one shore to another as before they now seemedto rotate on one spot the historical figures at the head of armies whoformerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering warscampaigns and battles now reflected the restless movement by politicaland diplomatic combinations laws and treatiesthe historians call this activity of the historical figures thereactionin dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historicalpersonages who in their opinion caused what they describe as thereaction all the wellknown people of that period from alexander andnapoleon to madame de stael photius schelling fichte chateaubriandand the rest pass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted orcondemned according to whether they conduced to progress or to reactionaccording to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in russiaalso and the chief culprit was alexander i the same man who accordingto them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencementof his reign being the savior of russiathere is no one in russian literature now from schoolboy essayist tolearned historian who does not throw his little stone at alexander forthings he did wrong at this period of his reignhe ought to have acted in this way and in that way in this case he didwell and in that case badly he behaved admirably at the beginning ofhis reign and during  but acted badly by giving a constitution topoland forming the holy alliance entrusting power to arakcheevfavoring golitsyn and mysticism and afterwards shishkov and photius healso acted badly by concerning himself with the active army anddisbanding the semenov regimentit would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches thehistorians address to him based on their knowledge of what is good forhumanitywhat do these reproaches meando not the very actions for which the historians praise alexander i theliberal attempts at the beginning of his reign his struggle withnapoleon the firmness he displayed in  and the campaign of flow from the same sourcesthe circumstances of his birth educationand lifethat made his personality what it was and from which theactions for which they blame him the holy alliance the restoration ofpoland and the reaction of  and later also flowedin what does the substance of those reproaches lieit lies in the fact that an historic character like alexander istanding on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with theblinding light of history focused upon him a character exposed to thosestrongest of all influences the intrigues flattery and selfdeceptioninseparable from power a character who at every moment of his life felta responsibility for all that was happening in europe and not afictitious but a live character who like every man had his personalhabits passions and impulses toward goodness beauty and truththatthis characterthough not lacking in virtue the historians do notaccuse him of thathad not the same conception of the welfare ofhumanity fifty years ago as a presentday professor who from his youthupwards has been occupied with learning that is with books andlectures and with taking notes from thembut even if we assume that fifty years ago alexander i was mistaken inhis view of what was good for the people we must inevitably assume thatthe historian who judges alexander will also after the lapse of sometime turn out to be mistaken in his view of what is good for humanitythis assumption is all the more natural and inevitable because watchingthe movement of history we see that every year and with each newwriter opinion as to what is good for mankind changes so that whatonce seemed good ten years later seems bad and vice versa and what ismore we find at one and the same time quite contradictory views as towhat is bad and what is good in history some people regard giving aconstitution to poland and forming the holy alliance as praiseworthy inalexander while others regard it as blameworthythe activity of alexander or of napoleon cannot be called useful orharmful for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmfulif that activity displeases somebody this is only because it does notagree with his limited understanding of what is good whether thepreservation of my fathers house in moscow or the glory of the russianarms or the prosperity of the petersburg and other universities or thefreedom of poland or the greatness of russia or the balance of power ineurope or a certain kind of european culture called progress appearto me to be good or bad i must admit that besides these things theaction of every historic character has other more general purposesinaccessible to mebut let us assume that what is called science can harmonize allcontradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad bywhich to try historic characters and events let us say that alexandercould have done everything differently let us say that with guidancefrom those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim of themovement of humanity he might have arranged matters according to theprogram his present accusers would have given himof nationalityfreedom equality and progress these i think cover the ground letus assume that this program was possible and had then been formulatedand that alexander had acted on it what would then have become of theactivity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed inthe governmentan activity that in the opinion of the historians wasgood and beneficent their activity would not have existed there wouldhave been no life there would have been nothingif we admit that human life can be ruled by reason the possibility oflife is destroyedif we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to theattainment of certain endsthe greatness of russia or of france thebalance of power in europe the diffusion of the ideas of therevolution general progress or anything elsethen it is impossible toexplain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions ofchance and geniusif the aim of the european wars at the beginning of the nineteenthcentury had been the aggrandizement of russia that aim might have beenaccomplished without all the preceding wars and without the invasion ifthe aim was the aggrandizement of france that might have been attainedwithout the revolution and without the empire if the aim was thedissemination of ideas the printing press could have accomplished thatmuch better than warfare if the aim was the progress of civilizationit is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilizationmore expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human liveswhy did it happen in this and not in some other waybecause it happened so chance created the situation genius utilizedit says historybut what is chance what is geniusthe words chance and genius do not denote any really existing thing andtherefore cannot be defined those words only denote a certain stage ofunderstanding of phenomena i do not know why a certain event occurs ithink that i cannot know it so i do not try to know it and i talk aboutchance i see a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinaryhuman agencies i do not understand why this occurs and i talk ofgeniusto a herd of rams the ram the herdsman drives each evening into aspecial enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the othersmust seem to be a genius and it must appear an astonishing conjunctionof genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ramwho instead of getting into the general fold every evening goes into aspecial enclosure where there are oatsthat this very ram swellingwith fat is killed for meatbut the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to themhappens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims they need onlyadmit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their kenand they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened tothe ram that was fattened even if they do not know for what purposethey are fattened they will at least know that all that happened to theram did not happen accidentally and will no longer need the conceptionsof chance or geniusonly by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediatelyintelligible to us and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond ourken may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of historiccharacters and perceive the cause of the effect they produceincommensurable with ordinary human capabilities and then the wordschance and genius become superfluouswe need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the europeanconvulsions and that we know only the factsthat is the murders firstin france then in italy in africa in prussia in austria in spainand in russiaand that the movements from the west to the east and fromthe east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events andnot only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius innapoleon and alexander but we shall be unable to consider them to beanything but like other men and we shall not be obliged to haverecourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which madethese people what they were but it will be clear that all those smallevents were inevitableby discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose we shallclearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed forany single plant better suited to it than those it produces so it isimpossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down to thesmallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill than napoleon andalexander with all their antecedentsthe fundamental and essential significance of the european events of thebeginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass ofthe european peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to westthe commencement of that movement was the movement from west to eastfor the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike movement tomoscow it was necessary  that they should form themselves into amilitary group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlikemilitary group of the east  that they should abandon all establishedtraditions and customs and  that during their military movement theyshould have at their head a man who could justify to himself and to themthe deceptions robberies and murders which would have to be committedduring that movementand beginning with the french revolution the old inadequately largegroup was destroyed as well as the old habits and traditions and stepby step a group was formed of larger dimensions with new customs andtraditions and a man was produced who would stand at the head of thecoming movement and bear the responsibility for all that had to be donea man without convictions without habits without traditions without aname and not even a frenchman emergesby what seem the strangestchancesfrom among all the seething french parties and without joiningany one of them is borne forward to a prominent positionthe ignorance of his colleagues the weakness and insignificance of hisopponents the frankness of his falsehoods and the dazzling and selfconfident limitations of this man raise him to the head of the army thebrilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to italy hisopponents reluctance to fight and his own childish audacity and selfconfidence secure him military fame innumerable socalled chancesaccompany him everywhere the disfavor into which he falls with therulers of france turns to his advantage his attempts to avoid hispredestined path are unsuccessful he is not received into the russianservice and the appointment he seeks in turkey comes to nothing duringthe war in italy he is several times on the verge of destruction andeach time is saved in an unexpected manner owing to various diplomaticconsiderations the russian armiesjust those which might have destroyedhis prestigedo not appear upon the scene till he is no longer thereon his return from italy he finds the government in paris in a processof dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped outand destroyed and by chance an escape from this dangerous positionpresents itself in the form of an aimless and senseless expedition toafrica again socalled chance accompanies him impregnable maltasurrenders without a shot his most reckless schemes are crowned withsuccess the enemys fleet which subsequently did not let a single boatpass allows his entire army to elude it in africa a whole series ofoutrages are committed against the almost unarmed inhabitants and themen who commit these crimes especially their leader assure themselvesthat this is admirable this is gloryit resembles caesar and alexanderthe great and is therefore goodthis ideal of glory and grandeurwhich consists not merely inconsidering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on everycrime one commits ascribing to it an incomprehensible supernaturalsignificancethat ideal destined to guide this man and his associateshad scope for its development in africa whatever he does succeeds theplague does not touch him the cruelty of murdering prisoners is notimputed to him as a fault his childishly rash uncalledfor andignoble departure from africa leaving his comrades in distress is setdown to his credit and again the enemys fleet twice lets him slippast when intoxicated by the crimes he has committed so successfullyhe reaches paris the dissolution of the republican government which ayear earlier might have ruined him has reached its extreme limit andhis presence there now as a newcomer free from party entanglements canonly serve to exalt himand though he himself has no plan he is quiteready for his new rolehe had no plan he was afraid of everything but the parties snatched athim and demanded his participationhe alonewith his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in italy andegypt his insane selfadulation his boldness in crime and frankness inlyinghe alone could justify what had to be donehe is needed for the place that awaits him and so almost apart from hiswill and despite his indecision his lack of a plan and all hismistakes he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power andthe conspiracy is crowned with successhe is pushed into a meeting of the legislature in alarm he wishes toflee considering himself lost he pretends to fall into a swoon andsays senseless things that should have ruined him but the once proudand shrewd rulers of france feeling that their part is played out areeven more bewildered than he and do not say the words they should havesaid to destroy him and retain their powerchance millions of chances give him power and all men as if byagreement cooperate to confirm that power chance forms the charactersof the rulers of france who submit to him chance forms the characterof paul i of russia who recognizes his government chance contrives aplot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms hispower chance puts the duc denghien in his hands and unexpectedlycauses him to kill himthereby convincing the mob more forcibly than inany other way that he had the

but unexpectedly falls upon mack andthe austrians who surrender without a battle chance and genius givehim the victory at austerlitz and by chance all men not only thefrench but all europeexcept england which does not take part in theevents about to happendespite their former horror and detestation ofhis crimes now recognize his authority the title he has given himselfand his ideal of grandeur and glory which seems excellent andreasonable to them allas if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement thewestern forces push toward the east several times in   and  gaining strength and growing in  the group of people thathad formed in france unites into one group with the peoples of centraleurope the strength of the justification of the man who stands at thehead of the movement grows with the increased size of the group duringthe tenyear preparatory period this man had formed relations with allthe crowned heads of europe the discredited rulers of the world

taken the russian army suffers heavier losses than the opposingarmies had suffered in the former war from austerlitz to wagram butsuddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitherto had soconsistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to thepredestined goal an innumerable sequence of inverse chances occurfromthe cold in his head at borodino to the sparks which set moscow on fireand the frostsand instead of genius stupidity and immeasurablebaseness become evidentthe invaders flee turn back flee again and all the chances are nownot for napoleon but always against hima countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with aremarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to eastattempted drives from east to westsimilar to the contrary movements of  and precede the great westward movement there is thesame coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions the same adhesionof the people of central europe to the movement the same hesitationmidway and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approachedparis the ultimate goal is reached the napoleonic government and armyare destroyed napoleon himself is no longer of any account all hisactions are evidently pitiful and mean but again an inexplicable chanceoccurs the allies detest napoleon whom they regard as the cause oftheir sufferings deprived of power and authority his crimes and hiscraft exposed he should have appeared to them what he appeared tenyears previously and one year lateran outlawed brigand but by somestrange chance no one perceives this his part is not yet ended the manwho ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigandis sent to an island two days sail from france which for some reasonis presented to him as his dominion and guards are given to him andmillions of money are paid himthe flood of nations begins to subside into its normal channels thewaves of the great movement abate and on the calm surface eddies areformed in which float the diplomatists who imagine that they havecaused the floods to abatebut the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed the diplomatiststhink that their disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure ofnatural forces they anticipate war between their sovereigns theposition seems to them insoluble but the wave they feel to be risingdoes not come from the quarter they expect it rises again from the samepoint as beforeparis the last backwash of the movement from the westoccurs a backwash which serves to solve the apparently insuperablediplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period ofhistorythe man who had devastated france returns to france alone without anyconspiracy and without soldiers any guard might arrest him but bystrange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man theycursed the day before and will curse again a month laterthis man is still needed to justify the final collective actthat act is performedthe last role is played the actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off hispowder and paint he will not be wanted any moreand some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to himself insolitude on his island justifying his actions by intrigues and lieswhen the justification is no longer needed and displaying to the wholeworld what it was that people had mistaken for strength as long as anunseen hand directed his actionsthe manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped the actorshows him to ussee what you believed in this is he do you now see that it was not hebut i who moved youbut dazed by the force of the movement it was long before peopleunderstood thisstill greater coherence and inevitability is seen in the life ofalexander i the man who stood at the head of the countermovement fromeast to westwhat was needed for him who overshadowing others stood at the head ofthat movement from east to westwhat was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with europeanaffairs but a remote sympathy not dulled by petty interests a moralsuperiority over those sovereigns of the day who cooperated with him amild and attractive personality and a personal grievance againstnapoleon and all this was found in alexander i all this had beenprepared by innumerable socalled chances in his life his educationhis early liberalism the advisers who surrounded him and byausterlitz and tilsit and erfurtduring the national war he was inactive because he was not needed butas soon as the necessity for a general european war presented itself heappeared in his place at the given moment and uniting the nations ofeurope led them to the goalthe goal is reached after the final war of  alexander possesses allpossible power how does he use italexander ithe pacifier of europe the man who from his early yearshad striven only for his peoples welfare the originator of the liberalinnovations in his fatherlandnow that he seemed to possess the utmostpower and therefore to have the possibility of bringing about thewelfare of his peoplesat the time when napoleon in exile was drawingup childish and mendacious plans of how he would have made mankind happyhad he retained poweralexander i having fulfilled his mission andfeeling the hand of god upon him suddenly recognizes the insignificanceof that supposed power turns away from it and gives it into the handsof contemptible men whom he

prince andrew natashas despair petyas deathand the old countess grief fell blow after blow on the old countshead he seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all theseevents and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting andinviting further blows which would finish him he seemed now frightenedand distraught and now unnaturally animated and enterprisingthe arrangements for natashas marriage occupied him for a while heordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful buthis cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be on the contrary itevoked the compassion of those who knew and liked himwhen pierre and his wife had left he grew very quiet and began tocomplain of depression a few days later he fell ill and took to hisbed he realized from the first that he would not get up again despitethe doctors encouragement the countess passed a fortnight in anarmchair by his pillow without undressing every time she gave him hismedicine he sobbed and silently kissed her hand on his last daysobbing he asked her and his absent son to forgive him for havingdissipated their propertythat being the chief fault of which he wasconscious after receiving communion and unction he quietly died andnext day a throng of acquaintances who came to pay their last respectsto the deceased filled the house rented by the rostovs all theseacquaintances who had so often dined and danced at his house and had sooften laughed at him now said with a common feeling of selfreproachand emotion as if justifying themselves well whatever he may havebeen he was a most worthy man you dont meet such men nowadays andwhich of us has not weaknesses of his ownit was just when the counts affairs had become so involved that it wasimpossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that heunexpectedly diednicholas was with the russian army in paris when the news of hisfathers death reached him he at once resigned his commission andwithout waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went tomoscow the state of the counts affairs became quite obvious a monthafter his death surprising everyone by the immense total of small debtsthe existence of which no one had suspected the debts amounted todouble the value of the propertyfriends and relations advised nicholas to decline the inheritance buthe regarded such a refusal as a slur on his fathers memory which heheld sacred and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted theinheritance together with the obligation to pay the debtsthe creditors who had so long been silent restrained by a vague butpowerful influence exerted on them while he lived by the countscareless good nature all proceeded to enforce their claims at once asalways happens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should getpaid first and those who like mitenka held promissory notes given themas presents now became the most exacting of the creditors nicholas wasallowed no respite and no peace and those who had seemed to pity theold manthe cause of their losses if they were lossesnowremorselessly pursued the young heir who had voluntarily undertaken thedebts and was obviously not guilty of contracting themnot one of the plans nicholas tried succeeded the estate was sold byauction for half its value and half the debts still remained unpaidnicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his brotherinlaw bezukhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely due for valuereceived and to avoid being imprisoned for the remainder as thecreditors threatened he reentered the government servicehe could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel atthe next vacancy for his mother now clung to him as her one hold onlife and so despite his reluctance to remain in moscow among people whohad known him before and despite his abhorrence of the civil servicehe accepted a post in moscow in that service doffed the uniform ofwhich he was so fond and moved with his mother and sonya to a smallhouse on the sivtsev vrazheknatasha and pierre were living in petersburg at the time and had noclear idea of nicholas circumstances having borrowed money from hisbrotherinlaw nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from himhis position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelvehundred rubles he had not only to keep himself his mother and sonyabut had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty thecountess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions shehad been used to from childhood and unable to realize how hard it wasfor her son kept demanding now a carriage which they did not keep tosend for a friend now some expensive article of food for herself orwine for her son or money to buy a present as a surprise for natasha orsonya or for nicholas himselfsonya kept house attended on her aunt read to her put up with herwhims and secret illwill and helped nicholas to conceal their povertyfrom the old countess nicholas felt himself irredeemably indebted tosonya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly admired herpatience and devotion but tried to keep aloof from herhe seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect andbecause there was nothing to reproach her with she had all that peopleare valued for but little that could have made him love her he feltthat the more he valued her the less he loved her he had taken her ather word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now behaved as if allthat had passed between them had been long forgotten and could never inany case be renewednicholas position became worse and worse the idea of putting somethingaside out of his salary proved a dream not only did he not saveanything but to comply with his mothers demands he even incurred somesmall debts he could see no way out of this situation the idea ofmarrying some rich woman which was suggested to him by his femalerelations was repugnant to him the other way outhis mothers deathnever entered his head he wished for nothing and hoped for nothing anddeep in his heart experienced a gloomy and stern satisfaction in anuncomplaining endurance of his position he tried to avoid his oldacquaintances with their commiseration and offensive offers ofassistance he avoided all distraction and recreation and even at homedid nothing but play cards with his mother pace silently up and downthe room and smoke one pipe after another he seemed carefully tocherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled him to endurehis positionat the beginning of winter princess mary came to moscow from reportscurrent in town she learned how the rostovs were situated and how theson has sacrificed himself for his mother as people were sayingi never expected anything else of him said princess mary to herselffeeling a joyous sense of her love for him remembering her friendlyrelations with all the rostovs which had made her almost a member of thefamily she thought it her duty to go to see them but remembering herrelations with nicholas in voronezh she was shy about doing so making agreat effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after herarrival in moscownicholas was the first to meet her as the countess room could only bereached through his but instead of being greeted with pleasure as shehad expected at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold stiffproud expression she had not seen on it before he inquired about herhealth led the way to his mother and having sat there for five minutesleft the roomwhen the princess came out of the countess room nicholas met her againand with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroomto her remarks about his mothers health he made no reply whats thatto you leave me in peace his looks seemed to saywhy does she come prowling here what does she want i cant bear theseladies and all these civilities said he aloud in sonyas presenceevidently unable to repress his vexation after the princess carriagehad disappearedoh nicholas how can you talk like that cried sonya hardly able toconceal her delight she is so kind and mamma is so fond of hernicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess anymore but after her visit the old countess spoke of her several times adayshe sang her praises insisted that her son must call on her expresseda wish to see her often but yet always became illhumored when shebegan to talk about hernicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the princessbut his silence irritated hershe is a very admirable and excellent young woman said she and youmust go and call on her you would at least be seeing somebody and ithink it must be dull for you only seeing usbut i dont in the least want to mammayou used to want to and now you dont really i dont understand youmy dear one day you are dull and the next you refuse to see anyonebut i never said i was dullwhy you said yourself you dont want even to see her she is a veryadmirable young woman and you always liked her but now suddenly youhave got some notion or other in your head you hide everything frommenot at all mammaif i were asking you to do something disagreeable nowbut i only askyou to return a call one would think mere politeness required itwell i have asked you and now i wont interfere any more since youhave secrets from your motherwell then ill go if you wish itit doesnt matter to me i only wish it for your sakenicholas sighed bit his mustache and laid out the cards for apatience trying to divert his mothers attention to another topicthe same conversation was repeated next day and the day after and theday after thatafter her visit to the rostovs and her unexpectedly chilly reception bynicholas princess mary confessed to herself that she had been right innot wishing to be the first to calli expected nothing else she told herself calling her pride to heraid i have nothing to do with him and i only wanted to see the oldlady who was always kind to me and to whom i am under manyobligationsbut she could not pacify herself with these reflections a feeling akinto remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit though she hadfirmly resolved not to call on the rostovs again and to forget the wholematter she felt herself all the time in an awkward position and whenshe asked herself what distressed her she had to admit that it was herrelation to rostov his cold polite manner did not express his feelingfor her she knew that but it concealed something and until she coulddiscover what that something was she felt that she could not be ateaseone day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to hernephews lessons she was informed that rostov had called with a firmresolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation she sentfor mademoiselle bourienne and went with her to the drawing roomher first glance at nicholas face told her that he had only come tofulfill the demands of politeness and she firmly resolved to maintainthe tone in which he addressed herthey spoke of the countess health of their mutual friends of thelatest war news and when the ten minutes required by propriety hadelapsed after which a visitor may rise nicholas got up to say goodbywith mademoiselle bouriennes help the princess had maintained theconversation very well but at the very last moment just when he roseshe was so tired of talking of what did not interest her and her mindwas so full of the question why she alone was granted so littlehappiness in life that in a fit of absentmindedness she sat still herluminous eyes gazing fixedly before her not noticing that he had risennicholas glanced at her and wishing to appear not to notice herabstraction made some remark to mademoiselle bourienne and then againlooked at the princess she still sat motionless with a look ofsuffering on her gentle face he suddenly felt sorry for her and wasvaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her faceexpressed he wished to help her and say something pleasant but couldthink of nothing to saygoodbye princess said heshe started flushed and sighed deeplyoh i beg your pardon she said as if waking up are you goingalready count well then goodby oh but the cushion for thecountesswait a moment ill fetch it said mademoiselle bourienne and sheleft the roomthey both sat silent with an occasional glance at one anotheryes princess said nicholas at last with a sad smile it doesntseem long ago since we first met at bogucharovo but how much water hasflowed since then in what distress we all seemed to be then yet iwould give much to bring back that time but theres no bringing itbackprincess mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones ashe said this she seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning ofhis words which would explain his feeling for heryes yes said she but you have no reason to regret the past countas i understand your present life i think you will always recall itwith satisfaction because the selfsacrifice that fills it nowi cannot accept your praise he interrupted her hurriedly on thecontrary i continually reproach myself but this is not at all aninteresting or cheerful subjecthis face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression but theprincess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved and itwas to him that she now spokei thought you would allow me to tell you this she said i had comeso near to you and to all your family that i thought you would notconsider my sympathy misplaced but i was mistaken and suddenly hervoice trembled i dont know why she continued recovering herselfbut you used to be different andthere are a thousand reasons why laying special emphasis on the whythank you princess he added softly sometimes it is hardso thats why thats why a voice whispered in princess marys soulno it was not only that gay kind and frank look not only thathandsome exterior that i loved in him i divined his noble resoluteselfsacrificing spirit too she said to herself yes he is poor nowand i am rich yes thats the only reason yes were it not forthat and remembering his former tenderness and looking now at hiskind sorrowful face she suddenly understood the cause of his coldnessbut why count why she almost cried unconsciously moving closer tohim why tell me you must tell mehe was silenti dont understand your why count she continued but its hard forme i confess it for some reason you wish to deprive me of our formerfriendship and that hurts me there were tears in her eyes and in hervoice i have had so little happiness in life that every loss is hardfor me to bear excuse me goodby and suddenly she began to cryand was hurrying from the roomprincess for gods sake he exclaimed trying to stop herprincessshe turned round for a few seconds they gazed silently into oneanothers eyesand what had seemed impossible and remote suddenlybecame possible inevitable and very nearin the winter of  nicholas married princess mary and moved to baldhills with his wife his mother and sonyawithin four years he had paid off all his remaining debts withoutselling any of his wifes property and having received a smallinheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to pierre as wellin another three years by  he had so managed his affairs that hewas able to buy a small estate adjoining bald hills and was negotiatingto buy back otradnoethat being his pet dreamhaving started farming from necessity he soon grew so devoted to itthat it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation nicholas wasa plain farmer he did not like innovations especially the english onesthen coming into vogue he laughed at theoretical treatises on estatemanagement disliked factories the raising of expensive products andthe buying of expensive seed corn and did not make a hobby of anyparticular part of the work on his estate he always had before hisminds eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it thechief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil nor the oxygenin the air nor manures nor special plows but that most importantagent by which nitrogen oxygen manure and plow were made effectivethe peasant laborer when nicholas first began farming and began tounderstand its different branches it was the serf who especiallyattracted his attention the peasant seemed to him not merely a toolbut also a judge of farming and an end in himself at first he watchedthe serfs trying to understand their aims and what they considered goodand bad and only pretended to direct them and give orders while inreality learning from them their methods their manner of speech andtheir judgment of what was good and bad only when he had understood thepeasants tastes and aspirations had learned to talk their language tograsp the hidden meaning of their words and felt akin to them did hebegin boldly to manage his serfs that is to perform toward them theduties demanded of him and nicholas management produced very brilliantresultsguided by some gift of insight on taking up the management of theestates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff village elder anddelegate the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had theyhad the right to choose and these posts never changed hands beforeanalyzing the properties of manure before entering into the debit andcredit as he ironically called it he found out how many cattle thepeasants had and increased the number by all possible means he kept thepeasant families together in the largest groups possible not allowingthe family groups to divide into separate households he was hard alikeon the lazy the depraved and the weak and tried to get them expelledfrom the communehe was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants hay andcorn as of his own and few landowners had their crops sown andharvested so early and so well or got so good a return as didnicholashe disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfsthe dronesas he called themand everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity whena decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf especially if onehad to be punished he always felt undecided and consulted everybody inthe house but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscriptedinstead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation henever felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants he knew that hisevery decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptionshe did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man or tomake things easy for or reward anyone merely because he felt inclinedto do so he could not have said by what standard he judged what heshould or should not do but the standard was quite firm and definite inhis own mindoften speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity he wouldsay what can one do with our russian peasants and imagined that hecould not bear themyet he loved our russian peasants and their way of life with his wholesoul and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the oneway and manner of farming which produced good resultscountess mary was jealous of this passion of her husbands and regrettedthat she could not share it but she could not understand the joys andvexations he derived from that world to her so remote and alien shecould not understand why he was so particularly animated and happy whenafter getting up at daybreak and spending the whole morning in thefields or on the threshing floor he returned from the sowing or mowingor reaping to have tea with her she did not understand why he spokewith such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and welltodo peasant matthew ermishin who with his family had carted corn allnight or of the fact that his nicholas sheaves were already stackedbefore anyone else had his harvest in she did not understand why hestepped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under his mustacheand winked so joyfully when warm steady rain began to fall on the dryand thirsty shoots of the young oats or why when the wind carried awaya threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return from thebarn flushed sunburned and perspiring with a smell of wormwood andgentian in his hair and gleefully rubbing his hands would say wellone more day and my grain and the peasants will all be under coverstill less did she understand why he kindhearted and always ready toanticipate her wishes should become almost desperate when she broughthim a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her tobe excused some work why he that kind nicholas should obstinatelyrefuse her angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not herbusiness she felt he had a world apart which he loved passionately andwhich had laws she had not fathomedsometimes when trying to understand him she spoke of the good work hewas doing for his serfs he would be vexed and reply not in the leastit never entered my head and i wouldnt do that for their good thatsall poetry and old wives talkall that doing good to ones neighborwhat i want is that our children should not have to go begging i mustput our affairs in order while i am alive thats all and to do thatorder and strictness are essential thats all about it said heclenching his vigorous fist and fairness of course he added forif the peasant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse hecan do no good either for himself or for meand all nicholas did was fruitfulprobably just because he refused toallow himself to think that he was doing good to others for virtuessake his means increased rapidly serfs from neighboring estates cameto beg him to buy them and long after his death the memory of hisadministration was devoutly preserved among the serfs he was amaster the peasants affairs first and then his own of course he wasnot to be trifled with eitherin a word he was a real masterone matter connected with his management sometimes worried nicholas andthat was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of makingfree use of his fists at first he saw nothing reprehensible in thisbut in the second year of his marriage his view of that form ofpunishment suddenly changedonce in summer he had sent for the village elder from bogucharovo a manwho had succeeded to the post when dron died and who was accused ofdishonesty and various irregularities nicholas went out into the porchto question him and immediately after the elder had given a few repliesthe sound of cries and blows were heard on returning to lunch nicholaswent up to his wife who sat with her head bent low over her embroideryframe and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing thatmorning among other things he spoke of the bogucharovo elder countessmary turned red and then pale but continued to sit with head bowed andlips compressed and gave her husband no replysuch an insolent scoundrel he cried growing hot again at the mererecollection of him if he had told me he was drunk and did not seebut what is the matter with you mary he suddenly askedcountess mary raised her head and tried to speak but hastily lookeddown again and her lips puckeredwhy whatever is the matter my dearestthe looks of the plain countess mary always improved when she was intears she never cried from pain or vexation but always from sorrow orpity and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charmthe moment nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herselfand began to crynicholas i saw it he was to blame but why do you nicholas andshe covered her face with her handsnicholas said nothing he flushed crimson left her side and paced upand down the room he understood what she was weeping about but couldnot in his heart at once agree with her that what he had regarded fromchildhood as quite an everyday event was wrong is it justsentimentality old wives tales or is she right he asked himselfbefore he had solved that point he glanced again at her face filled withlove and pain and he suddenly realized that she was right and that hehad long been sinning against himselfmary he said softly going up to her it will never happen again igive you my word never he repeated in a trembling voice like a boyasking for forgivenessthe tears flowed faster still from the countess eyes she took his handand kissed itnicholas when did you break your cameo she asked to change thesubject looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo oflaocoons headtodayit was the same affair oh mary dont remind me of it andagain he flushed i give you my word of honor it shant occur againand let this always be a reminder to me and he pointed to the brokenringafter that when in discussions with his village elders or stewards theblood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench nicholas wouldturn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes before theman who was making him angry but he did forget himself once or twicewithin a twelvemonth and then he would go and confess to his wife andwould again promise that this should really be the very last timemary you must despise me he would say i deserve ityou should go go away at once if you dont feel strong enough tocontrol yourself she would reply sadly trying to comfort her husbandamong the gentry of the province nicholas was respected but not likedhe did not concern himself with the interests of his own class andconsequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid thewhole summer from spring sowing to harvest he was busy with the workon his farm in autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the samebusinesslike seriousnessleaving home for a month or even two withhis hunt in winter he visited his other villages or spent his timereading the books he read were chiefly historical and on these hespent a certain sum every year he was collecting as he said a seriouslibrary and he made it a rule to read through all the books he boughthe would sit in his study with a grave air readinga task he firstimposed upon himself as a duty but which afterwards became a habitaffording him a special kind of pleasure and a consciousness of beingoccupied with serious matters in winter except for businessexcursions he spent most of his time at home making himself one withhis family and entering into all the details of his childrens relationswith their mother the harmony between him and his wife grew closer andcloser and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in herfrom the time of his marriage sonya had lived in his house before thatnicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself andsonya blaming himself and commending her he had asked princess mary tobe gentle and kind to his cousin she thoroughly realized the wrong hehad done sonya felt herself to blame toward her and imagined that herwealth had influenced nicholas choice she could not find fault withsonya in any way and tried to be fond of her but often felt illwilltoward her which she could not overcomeonce she had a talk with her friend natasha about sonya and about herown injustice toward heryou know said natasha you have read the gospels a great dealthereis a passage in them

lacks egotism i dont know but from her is taken away andeverything has been taken away sometimes i am dreadfully sorry for herformerly i very much wanted nicholas to marry her but i always had asort of presentiment that it would not come off she is a sterileflower you knowlike some strawberry blossoms sometimes i am sorryfor her and sometimes i think she doesnt feel it as you or i wouldthough countess mary told natasha that those words in the gospel must beunderstood differently yet looking at sonya she agreed with natashasexplanation it really seemed that sonya did not feel her positiontrying and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a sterile flowershe seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of the family as awhole like a cat she had attached herself not to the people but to thehome she waited on the old countess petted and spoiled the childrenwas always ready to render the small services for which she had a giftand all this was unconsciously accepted from her with insufficientgratitudethe country seat at bald hills had been rebuilt though not on the samescale as under the old princethe buildings begun under straitened circumstances were more thansimple the immense house on the old stone foundations was of woodplastered only inside it had bare deal floors and was furnished withvery simple hard sofas armchairs tables and chairs made by their ownserf carpenters out of their own birchwood the house was spacious andhad rooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors wholefamilies of the rostovs and bolkonskis relations sometimes came tobald hills with sixteen horses and dozens of servants and stayed formonths besides that four times a year on the name days and birthdaysof the hosts as many as a hundred visitors would gather there for a dayor two the rest of the year life pursued its unbroken routine with itsordinary occupations and its breakfasts lunches dinners and suppersprovided out of the produce of the estateit was the eve of st nicholas the fifth of december  natasha hadbeen staying at her brothers with her husband and children since earlyautumn pierre had gone to petersburg on business of his own for threeweeks as he said but had remained there nearly seven weeks and wasexpected back every minutebesides the bezukhov family nicholas old friend the retired generalvasili dmitrich denisov was staying with the rostovs this fifth ofdecemberon the sixth which was his name day when the house would be full ofvisitors nicholas knew he would have to exchange his tartar tunic for atail coat and put on narrow boots with pointed toes and drive to thenew church he had built and then receive visitors who would come tocongratulate him offer them refreshments and talk about the electionsof the nobility but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve ofthat day in his usual way he examined the bailiffs accounts of thevillage in ryazan which belonged to his wifes nephew wrote twobusiness letters and walked over to the granaries cattle yards andstables before dinner having taken precautions against the generaldrunkenness to be expected on the morrow because it was a great saintsday he returned to dinner and without having time for a private talkwith his wife sat down at the long table laid for twenty persons atwhich the whole household had assembled at that table were his motherhis mothers old lady companion belova his wife their three childrenwith their governess and tutor his wifes nephew with his tutor sonyadenisov natasha her three children their governess and old michaelivanovich the late princes architect who was living on in retirementat bald hillscountess mary sat at the other end of the table when her husband tookhis place she concluded from the rapid manner in which after taking uphis table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass standingbefore him that he was out of humor as was sometimes the case when hecame in to dinner straight from the farmespecially before the soupcountess mary well knew that mood of his and when she herself was in agood frame of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and thenbegan to talk to him and make him admit that there was no cause for hisillhumor but today she quite forgot that and was hurt that he shouldbe angry with her without any reason and she felt unhappy she askedhim where he had been he replied she again inquired whether everythingwas going well on the farm her unnatural tone made him winceunpleasantly and he replied hastilythen im not mistaken thought countess mary why is he cross withme she concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and wishedto end the conversation she knew her remarks sounded unnatural butcould not refrain from asking some more questionsthanks to denisov the conversation at table soon became general andlively and she did not talk to her husband when they left the tableand went as usual to thank the old countess countess mary held out herhand and kissed her husband and asked him why he was angry with heryou always have such strange fancies i didnt even think of beingangry he repliedbut the word always seemed to her to imply yes i am angry but i wonttell you whynicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even sonya and theold countess who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagreecould find nothing to reproach them with but even they had theirmoments of antagonism occasionally and it was always just after theyhad been happiest together they suddenly had a feeling of estrangementand hostility which occurred most frequently during countess maryspregnancies and this was such a timewell messieurs et mesdames said nicholas loudly and with apparentcheerfulness it seemed to countess mary that he did it on purpose tovex her i have been on my feet since six this morning tomorrow ishall have to suffer so today ill go and restand without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room andlay down on the sofathats always the way thought countess mary he talks to everyoneexcept me i see i see that i am repulsive to him especially when iam in this condition she looked down at her expanded figure and in theglass at her pale sallow emaciated face in which her eyes now lookedlarger than everand everything annoyed herdenisovs shouting and laughter natashastalk and especially a quick glance sonya gave hersonya was always the first excuse countess mary found for feelingirritatedhaving sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything ofwhat they were saying she softly left the room and went to the nurserythe children were playing at going to moscow in a carriage made ofchairs and invited her to go with them she sat down and played withthem a little but the thought of her husband and his unreasonablecrossness worried her she got up and walking on tiptoe withdifficulty went to the small sitting roomperhaps he is not asleep ill have an explanation with him she saidto herself little andrew her eldest boy imitating his motherfollowed her on tiptoe she did not notice himmary dear i think he is asleephe was so tired said sonya meetingher in the large sitting room it seemed to countess mary that shecrossed her path everywhere andrew may wake himcountess mary looked round saw little andrew following her felt thatsonya was right and for that very reason flushed and with evidentdifficulty refrained from saying something harsh she made no reply butto avoid obeying sonya beckoned to andrew to follow her quietly and wentto the door sonya went away by another door from the room in whichnicholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing everyslightest tone of which was familiar to his wife as she listened to itshe saw before her his smooth handsome forehead his mustache and hiswhole face as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the nightwhen he slept nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat and atthat moment little andrew shouted from outside the door papa mammasstanding here countess mary turned pale with fright and made signs tothe boy he grew silent and quiet ensued for a moment terrible tocountess mary she knew how nicholas disliked being waked then throughthe door she heard nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring andhis voice said crosslyi cant get a moments peace mary is that you why did you bringhim herei only came in to look and did not notice forgive menicholas coughed and said no more countess mary moved away from thedoor and took the boy back to the nursery five minutes later littleblackeyed threeyearold natasha her fathers pet having learned fromher brother that papa was asleep and mamma was in the sitting room ranto her father unobserved by her mother the darkeyed little girl boldlyopened the creaking door went up to the sofa with energetic steps ofher sturdy little legs and having examined the position of her fatherwho was asleep with his back to her rose on tiptoe and kissed the handwhich lay under his head nicholas turned with a tender smile on hisfacenatasha natasha came countess marys frightened whisper from thedoor papa wants to sleepno mamma he doesnt want to

hairmay i kiss mamma he asked natashanatasha smiled bashfullyagain she commanded pointing with a peremptory gesture to the spotwhere nicholas had placed the kissi dont know why you think i am cross said nicholas replying to thequestion he knew was in his wifes mindyou have no idea how unhappy how lonely i feel when you are likethat it always seems to memary dont talk nonsense you ought to be ashamed of yourself hesaid gailyit seems to be that you cant love me that i am so plain alwaysand now in this condoh how absurd you are it is not beauty that endears its love thatmakes us see beauty it is only malvinas and women of that kind who areloved for their beauty but do i love my wife i dont love her buti dont know how to put it without you or when something comes betweenus like this i

getting up and smoothing his hairhe began to pace the roomdo you know mary what ive been thinking he began immediatelythinking aloud in his wifes presence now that they had made it uphe did not ask if she was ready to listen to him he did not care athought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also and he toldher of his intention to persuade pierre to stay with them till springcountess mary listened till he had finished made some remark and inher turn began thinking aloud her thoughts were about the childrenyou can see the woman in her already she said in french pointing tolittle natasha you reproach us women with being illogical here is ourlogic i say papa wants to sleep but she says no hes laughingand she was right said countess mary with a happy smileyes yes and nicholas taking his little daughter in his strong handlifted her high placed her on his shoulder held her by the legs andpaced the room with her there was an expression of carefree happinesson the faces of both father and daughterbut you know you may be unfair you are too fond of this one his wifewhispered in frenchyes but what am i to do i try not to showat that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps inthe hall and anteroom as if someone had arrivedsomebody has comei am sure it is pierre i will go and see said countess mary and leftthe roomin her absence nicholas allowed himself to give his little daughter agallop round the room out of breath he took the laughing child quicklyfrom his shoulder and pressed her to his heart his capers reminded himof dancing and looking at the childs round happy little face hethought of what she would be like when he was an old man taking herinto society and dancing the mazurka with her as his old father haddanced daniel cooper with his daughterit is he it is he nicholas said countess mary reentering the rooma few minutes later now our natasha has come to life you should haveseen her ecstasy and how he caught it for having stayed away so longwell come along now quick quick its time you two were parted sheadded looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her fathernicholas went out holding the child by the handcountess mary remained in the sitting roomi should never never have believed that one could be so happy shewhispered to herself a smile lit up her face but at the same time shesighed and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she feltthrough her happiness that there is another sort of happinessunattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at thatinstantnatasha had married in the early spring of  and in  already hadthree daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she wasnow nursing she had grown stouter and broader so that it was difficultto recognize in this robust motherly woman the slim lively natasha offormer days her features were more defined and had a calm soft andserene expression in her face there was none of the everglowinganimation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm nowher face and body were often all that one saw and her soul was notvisible at all all that struck the eye was a strong handsome andfertile woman the old fire very rarely kindled in her face now thathappened only when as was the case that day her husband returned homeor a sick child was convalescent or when she and countess mary spoke ofprince andrew she never mentioned him to her husband who she imaginedwas jealous of prince andrews memory or on the rare occasions whensomething happened to induce her to sing a practice she had quiteabandoned since her marriage at the rare moments when the old fire didkindle in her handsome fully developed body she was even moreattractive than in former dayssince their marriage natasha and her husband had lived in moscow inpetersburg on their estate near moscow or with her mother that is tosay in nicholas house the young countess bezukhova was not often seenin society and those who met her there were not pleased with her andfound her neither attractive nor amiable not that natasha likedsolitudeshe did not know whether she liked it or not she even thoughtthat she did notbut with her pregnancies her confinements thenursing of her children and sharing every moment of her husbands lifeshe had demands on her time which could be satisfied only by renouncingsociety all who had known natasha before her marriage wondered at thechange in her as at something extraordinary only the old countess withher maternal instinct had realized that all natashas outbursts had beendue to her need of children and a husbandas she herself had onceexclaimed at otradnoe not so much in fun as in earnestand her motherwas now surprised at the surprise expressed by those who had neverunderstood natasha and she kept saying that she had always known thatnatasha would make an exemplary wife and motheronly she lets her love of her husband and children overflow allbounds said the countess so that it even becomes absurdnatasha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folkespecially by the french which says that a girl should not let herselfgo when she marries should not neglect her accomplishments should beeven more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried andshould fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became herhusband natasha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witcheryof which her singing had been an unusually powerful part she gave it upjust because it was so powerfully seductive she took no pains with hermanners or with delicacy of speech or with her toilet or to showherself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes or to avoidinconveniencing him by being too exacting she acted in contradiction toall those rules she felt that the allurements instinct had formerlytaught her to use would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of herhusband to whom she had from the first moment given herself upentirelythat is with her whole soul leaving no corner of it hiddenfrom him she felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained bythe poetic feelings that had attracted him to her but by somethingelseindefinite but firm as the bond between her own body and soulto fluff out her curls put on fashionable dresses and sing romanticsongs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adornherself to attract herself to adorn herself for others might perhapshave been agreeableshe did not knowbut she had no time at all forit the chief reason for devoting no time either to singing to dressor to choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare forthese thingswe know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in asubject however trivial it may be and that there is no subject sotrivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if ones entireattention is devoted to itthe subject which wholly engrossed natashas attention was her familythat is her husband whom she had to keep so that he should belongentirely to her and to the home and the children whom she had to bearbring into the world nurse and bring upand the deeper she penetrated not with her mind only but with her wholesoul her whole being into the subject that absorbed her the largerdid that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powersappear so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yetwas unable to accomplish all that she considered necessarythere were then as now conversations and discussions about womensrights the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and rightsthough these themes were not yet termed questions as they are now butthese topics were not merely uninteresting to natasha she positivelydid not understand themthese questions then as now existed only for those who see nothing inmarriage but the pleasure married people get from one another that isonly the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significance whichlies in the familydiscussions and questions of that kind which are like the question ofhow to get the greatest gratification from ones dinner did not thenand do not now exist for those for whom the purpose of a dinner is thenourishment it affords and the purpose of marriage is the familyif the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body a man who eats twodinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain hispurpose for his stomach will not digest the two dinnersif the purpose of marriage is the family the person who wishes to havemany wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure but in thatcase will not have a familyif the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is thefamily the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than onecan digest and not having more wives or husbands than are needed forthe familythat is one wife or one husband natasha needed a husbanda husband was given her and he gave her a family and she not only sawno need of any other or better husband but as all the powers of hersoul were intent on serving that husband and family she could notimagine and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things weredifferentnatasha did not care for society in general but prized the more thesociety of her relativescountess mary and her brother her motherand sonya she valued the company of those to whom she could comestriding disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown and withjoyful face show a yellow instead of a green stain on babys napkin andfrom whom she could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby wasmuch betterto such an extent had natasha let herself go that the way she dressedand did her hair her illchosen words and her jealousyshe wasjealous of sonya of the governess and of every woman pretty or plainwere habitual subjects of jest to those about her the general opinionwas that pierre was under his wifes thumb which was really true fromthe very first days of their married life natasha had announced herdemands pierre was greatly surprised by his wifes view to him aperfectly novel one that every moment of his life belonged to her andto the family his wifes demands astonished him but they alsoflattered him and he submitted to thempierres subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared notflirt with but dared not even speak smilingly to any other woman didnot dare dine at the club as a pastime did not dare spend money on awhim and did not dare absent himself for any length of time except onbusinessin which his wife included his intellectual pursuits whichshe did not in the least understand but to which she attributed greatimportance to make up for this at home pierre had the right toregulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose athome natasha placed herself in the position of a slave to her husbandand the whole household went on tiptoe when he was occupiedthat iswas reading or writing in his study pierre had but to show a partialityfor anything to get just what he liked done always he had only toexpress a wish and natasha would jump up and run to fulfill itthe entire household was governed according to pierres supposed ordersthat is by his wishes which natasha tried to guess their way of lifeand place of residence their acquaintances and ties natashasoccupations the childrens upbringing were all selected not merelywith regard to pierres expressed wishes but to what natasha from thethoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be and shededuced the essentials of his wishes quite correctly and having oncearrived at them clung to them tenaciously when pierre himself wanted tochange his mind she would fight him with his own weaponsthus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of theirfirst child who was delicate when they had to change the wet nursethree times and natasha fell ill from despair pierre one day told herof rousseaus view with which he quite agreed that to have a wet nurseis unnatural and harmful when her next baby was born despite theopposition of her mother the doctors and even of her husband himselfwho were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby herself a thingthen unheard of and considered injuriousshe insisted on having her ownway and after that nursed all her babies herselfit very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wifewould have a dispute but long afterwards pierre to his surprise anddelight would find in his wifes ideas and actions the very thoughtagainst which she had argued but divested of everything superfluousthat in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expressing hisopinionafter seven years of marriage pierre had the joyous and firmconsciousness that he was not a bad man and he felt this because he sawhimself reflected in his wife he felt the good and bad within himselfinextricably mingled and overlapping but only what was really good inhim was reflected in his wife all that was not quite good was rejectedand this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct andmysterious reflectiontwo months previously when pierre was already staying with the rostovshe had received a letter from prince theodore asking him to come topetersburg to confer on some important questions that were beingdiscussed there by a society of which pierre was one of the principalfounderson reading that letter she always read her husbands letters natashaherself suggested that he should go to petersburg though she would feelhis absence very acutely she attributed immense importance to all herhusbands intellectual and abstract interests though she did notunderstand them and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in suchmatters to pierres timid look of inquiry after reading the letter shereplied by asking him to go but to fix a definite date for his returnhe was given four weeks leave of absenceever since that leave of absence had expired more than a fortnightbefore natasha had been in a constant state of alarm depression andirritabilitydenisov now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied withthe present state of affairs had arrived during that fortnight helooked at natasha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad likeness of aperson once dear a dull dejected look random replies and talk aboutthe nursery was all he saw and heard from his former enchantressnatasha was sad and irritable all that time especially when her motherher brother sonya or countess mary in their efforts to console hertried to excuse pierre and suggested reasons for his delay in returningits all nonsense all rubbishthose discussions which lead to nothingand all those idiotic societies natasha declared of the very affairsin the immense importance of which she firmly believedand she would go to the nursery to nurse petya her only boy no oneelse could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as thislittle threemonthold creature when he lay at her breast and she wasconscious of the movement of his lips and the snuffling of his littlenose that creature said you are angry you are jealous you wouldlike to pay him out you are afraidbut here am i and i am he andthat was unanswerable it was more than trueduring that fortnight of anxiety natasha resorted to the baby forcomfort so often and fussed over him so much that she overfed him andhe fell ill she was terrified by his illness and yet that was justwhat she needed while attending to him she bore the anxiety about herhusband more easilyshe was nursing her boy when the sound of pierres sleigh was heard atthe front door and the old nurseknowing how to please her mistressentered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a beaming facehas he come natasha asked quickly in a whisper afraid to move lestshe should rouse the dozing babyhes come maam whispered the nursethe blood rushed to natashas face and her feet involuntarily moved butshe could not jump up and run out the baby again opened his eyes andlooked at her youre here he seemed to be saying and again lazilysmacked his lipscautiously withdrawing her breast natasha rocked him a little handedhim to the nurse and went with rapid steps toward the door but at thedoor she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for having in herjoy left the child too soon and she glanced round the nurse withraised elbows was lifting the infant over the rail of his cotgo maam dont worry go she whispered smiling with the kind offamiliarity that grows up between a nurse and her mistressnatasha ran with light footsteps to the anteroomdenisov who had come out of the study into the dancing room with hispipe now for the first time recognized the old natasha a flood ofbrilliant joyful light poured from her transfigured facehes come she exclaimed as she ran past and denisov felt that he toowas delighted that pierre whom he did not much care for had returnedon reaching the vestibule natasha saw a tall figure in a fur coatunwinding his scarf its he its really he he has come she said toherself and rushing at him embraced him pressed his head to herbreast and then pushed him back and gazed at his ruddy happy facecovered with hoarfrost yes it is he happy and contentedthen all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she hadexperienced for the last fortnight and the joy that had lit up her facevanished she frowned and overwhelmed pierre with a torrent ofreproaches and angry wordsyes its all very well for you you are pleased youve had a goodtime but what about me you might at least have shown considerationfor the children i am nursing and my milk was spoiled petya was atdeaths door but you were enjoying yourself yes enjoyingpierre knew he was not to blame for he could not have come sooner heknew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a minute or twoabove all he knew that he himself was bright and happy he wanted tosmile but dared not even think of doing so he made a piteousfrightened face and bent downi could not on my honor but how is petyaall right now come along i wonder youre not ashamed if only youcould see what i was like without you how i sufferedyou are wellcome come she said not letting go of his arm and they went totheir roomswhen nicholas and his wife came to look for pierre he was in the nurseryholding his baby son who was again awake on his huge right palm anddandling him a blissful bright smile was fixed on the babys broad facewith its toothless open mouth the storm was long since over and therewas bright joyous sunshine on natashas face as she gazed tenderly ather husband and childand have you talked everything well over with prince theodore sheaskedyes capitallyyou see he holds it up she meant the babys head but how he didfrighten me youve seen the princess is it true shes in love withthatyes just fancyat that moment nicholas and countess mary came in pierre with the babyon his hand stooped kissed them and replied to their inquiries but inspite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed the babywith the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all hisattentionhow sweet said countess mary looking at and playing with the babynow nicholas she added turning to her husband i cant understandhow it is you dont see the charm of these delicious marvelsi dont and cant replied nicholas looking coldly at the baby alump of flesh come along pierreand yet hes such an affectionate father said countess maryvindicating her husband but only after they are a year old or sonow pierre nurses them splendidly said natasha he says his hand isjust made for a babys seat just lookonly not for this pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh andshifting the baby he gave him to the nurseas in every large household there were at bald hills several perfectlydistinct worlds which merged into one harmonious whole though eachretained its own peculiarities and made concessions to the others everyevent joyful or sad that took place in that house was important to allthese worlds but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieveover that occurrence independently of the othersfor instance pierres return was a joyful and important event and theyall felt it to be sothe servantsthe most reliable judges of their masters because theyjudge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by theiracts and way of lifewere glad of pierres return because they knewthat when he was there count nicholas would cease going every day toattend to the estate and would be in better spirits and temper andalso because they would all receive handsome presents for the holidaysthe children and their governesses were glad of pierres return becauseno one else drew them into the social life of the household as he didhe alone could play on the clavichord that ecossaise his only piece towhich as he said all possible dances could be danced and they feltsure he had brought presents for them allyoung nicholas now a slim lad of fifteen delicate and intelligentwith curly lightbrown hair and beautiful eyes was delighted becauseuncle pierre as he called him was the object of his rapturous andpassionate affection no one had instilled into him this love for pierrewhom he saw only occasionally countess mary who had brought him up haddone her utmost to make him love her husband as she loved him andlittle nicholas did love his uncle but loved him with just a shade ofcontempt pierre however he adored he did not want to be an hussar ora knight of st george like his uncle nicholas he wanted to be learnedwise and kind like pierre in pierres presence his face always shonewith pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when pierre spoke tohim he did not miss a single word he uttered and would afterwardswith dessalles or by himself recall and reconsider the meaning ofeverything pierre had said pierres past life and his unhappiness priorto  of which young nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture fromsome words he had overheard his adventures in moscow his captivityplaton karataev of whom he had heard from pierre his love for natashaof whom the lad was also particularly fond and especially pierresfriendship with the father whom nicholas could not rememberall thismade pierre in his eyes a hero and a saintfrom broken remarks about natasha and his father from the emotion withwhich pierre spoke of that dead father and from the careful reverenttenderness with which natasha spoke of him the boy who was only justbeginning to guess what love is derived the notion that his father hadloved natasha and when dying had left her to his friend but the fatherwhom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could notbe pictured and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart andtears of sadness and rapture so the boy also was happy that pierre hadarrivedthe guests welcomed pierre because he always helped to enliven and uniteany company he was inthe grownup members of the family not to mention his wife werepleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothlyand peacefullythe old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them andespecially that natasha would now be herself againpierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and madehaste to satisfy all their expectationsthough the most absentminded and forgetful of men pierre with the aidof a list his wife drew up had now bought everything not forgettinghis motherand brotherinlaws commissions nor the dress material fora present to belova nor toys for his wifes nephews in the early daysof his marriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expecthim not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy and hehad been taken aback by her serious annoyance when on his first trip heforgot everything but in time he grew used to this demand knowing thatnatasha asked nothing for herself and gave him commissions for othersonly when he himself had offered to undertake them he now found anunexpected and childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents foreveryone in the house and never forgot anything if he now incurrednatashas censure it was only for buying too many and too expensivethings to her other defects as most people thought them but which topierre were qualities of untidiness and neglect of herself she nowadded stinginessfrom the time that pierre began life as a family man on a footingentailing heavy expenditure he had noticed to his surprise that hespent only half as much as before and that his affairswhich had beenin disorder of late chiefly because of his first wifes debtshadbegun to improvelife was cheaper because it was circumscribed that most expensiveluxury the kind of life that can be changed at any moment was nolonger his nor did he wish for it he felt that his way of life had nowbeen settled once for all till death and that to change it was not inhis power and so that way of life proved economicalwith a merry smiling face pierre was sorting his purchaseswhat do you think of this said he unrolling a piece of stuff like ashopmannatasha who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on herlap turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the things heshowed herthats for belova excellent she felt the quality of the materialit was a ruble an arshin i supposepierre told her the pricetoo dear natasha remarked how pleased the children will be andmamma too only you need not have bought me this she added unable tosuppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb set with pearlsof a kind then just coming into fashionadele tempted me she kept on telling me to buy it returned pierrewhen am i to wear it and natasha stuck it in her coil of hair wheni take little masha into society perhaps they will be fashionable againby then well lets go nowand collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and then tothe old countess roomsthe countess was sitting with her companion belova playing grandpatience as usual when pierre and natasha came into the drawing roomwith parcels under their armsthe countess was now over sixty was quite gray and wore a cap with afrill that surrounded her face her face had shriveled her upper liphad sunk in and her eyes were dimafter the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession shefelt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and leftwithout aim or object for her existence she ate drank slept or keptawake but did not live life gave her no new impressions she wantednothing from life but tranquillity and that tranquillity only deathcould give her but until death came she had to go on living that isto use her vital forces a peculiarity one sees in very young childrenand very old people was particularly evident in her her life had noexternal aimsonly a need to exercise her various functions andinclinations was apparent she had to eat sleep think speak weepwork give vent to her anger and so on merely because she had astomach a brain muscles nerves and a liver she did these things notunder any external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do whenbehind the purpose for which they strive that of exercising theirfunctions remains unnoticed she talked only because she physicallyneeded to exercise her tongue and lungs she cried as a child doesbecause her nose had to be cleared and so on what for people in theirfull vigor is an aim was for her evidently merely a pretextthus in the morningespecially if she had eaten anything rich the daybeforeshe felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiestpretext belovas deafnessshe would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other endof the roomit seems a little warmer today my dear she would murmurand when belova replied oh yes theyve come she would mutterangrily o lord how stupid and deaf she isanother pretext would be her snuff which would seem too dry or too dampor not rubbed fine enough after these fits of irritability her facewould grow yellow and her maids knew by infallible symptoms when belovawould again be deaf the snuff damp and the countess face yellow justas she needed to work off her spleen so she had sometimes to exerciseher stillexisting faculty of thinkingand the pretext for that was agame of patience when she needed to cry the deceased count would bethe pretext when she wanted to be agitated nicholas and his healthwould be the pretext and when she felt a need to speak spitefully thepretext would be countess mary when her vocal organs needed exercisewhich was usually toward seven oclock when she had had an afterdinnerrest in a darkened room the pretext would be the retelling of the samestories over and over again to the same audiencethe old ladys condition was understood by the whole household though noone ever spoke of it and they all made every possible effort to satisfyher needs only by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile betweennicholas pierre natasha and countess mary was the commonunderstanding of her condition expressedbut those glances expressed something more they said that she hadplayed her part in life that what they now saw was not her whole selfthat we must all become like her and that they were glad to yield toher to restrain themselves for this once precious being formerly asfull of life as themselves but now so much to be pitied mementomori said these glancesonly the really heartless the stupid ones of that household and thelittle children failed to understand this and avoided herwhen pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was inone of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion ofplaying patience and sothough by force of habit she greeted him withthe words she always used when pierre or her son returned after anabsence high time my dear high time we were all weary of waitingfor you well thank god and received her presents with anothercustomary remark its not the gift thats precious my dear but thatyou give it to me an old womanyet it was evident that she was notpleased by pierres arrival at that moment when it diverted herattention from the unfinished gameshe finished her game of patience and only then examined the presentsthey consisted of a box for cards of splendid workmanship a brightblue sevres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with a lidand a gold snuffbox with the counts portrait on the lid which pierrehad had done by a miniaturist in petersburg the countess had longwished for such a box but as she did not want to cry just then sheglanced indifferently at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly tothe box for cardsthank you my dear you have cheered me up said she as she alwaysdid but best of all you have brought yourself backfor i never sawanything like it you ought to give your wife a scolding what are we todo with her she is like a mad woman when you are away doesnt seeanything doesnt remember anything she went on repeating her usualphrases look anna timofeevna she added to her companion see whata box for cards my son has brought usbelova admired the presents and was delighted with her dress materialthough pierre natasha nicholas countess mary and denisov had much totalk about that they could not discuss before the old countessnot thatanything was hidden from her but because she had dropped so farbehindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in herpresence they would have had to answer inopportune questions and torepeat what they had already told her many times that soandso wasdead and soandso was married which she would again be unable torememberyet they sat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room fromhabit and pierre answered the countess questions as to whether princevasili had aged and whether countess mary alexeevna had sent greetingsand still thought of them and other matters that interested no one andto which she herself was indifferentconversation of this kind interesting to no one yet unavoidablecontinued all through teatime all the grownup members of the familywere assembled near the round tea table at which sonya presided besidethe samovar the children with their tutors and governesses had had teaand their voices were audible from the next room at tea all sat intheir accustomed places nicholas beside the stove at a small tablewhere his tea was handed to him milka the old gray borzoi bitchdaughter of the first milka with a quite gray face and large blackeyes that seemed more prominent than ever lay on the armchair besidehim denisov whose curly hair mustache and whiskers had turned halfgray sat beside countess mary with his generals tunic unbuttonedpierre sat between his wife and the old countess he spoke of what heknew might interest the old lady and that she could understand he toldher of external social events and of the people who had formed thecircle of her contemporaries and had once been a real living anddistinct group but who were now for the most part scattered about theworld and like herself were garnering the last ears of the harvests theyhad sown in earlier years but to the old countess those contemporariesof hers seemed to be the only serious and real society natasha saw bypierres animation that his visit had been interesting and that he hadmuch to tell them but dare not say it before the old countess denisovnot being a member of the family did not understand pierres cautionand being as a malcontent much interested in what was occurring inpetersburg kept urging pierre to tell them about what had happened inthe semenovsk regiment then about arakcheev and then about the biblesociety once or twice pierre was carried away and began to speak ofthese things but nicholas and natasha always brought him back to thehealth of prince ivan and countess mary alexeevnawell and all this idiocygossner and tatawinova denisov asked isthat weally still going ongoing on pierre exclaimed why more than ever the bible society isthe whole government nowwhat is that mon cher ami asked the countess who had finished hertea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry after her meal whatare you saying about the government i dont understandwell you know maman nicholas interposed knowing how to translatethings into his mothers language prince alexander golitsyn hasfounded a society and in consequence has great influence they sayarakcheev and golitsyn incautiously remarked pierre are now thewhole government and what a government they see treason everywhere andare afraid of everythingwell and how is prince alexander to blame he is a most estimable mani used to meet him at mary antonovnas said the countess in anoffended tone and still more offended that they all remained silentshe went on nowadays everyone finds fault a gospel society well andwhat harm is there in that and she rose everybody else got up tooand with a severe expression sailed back to her table in the sittingroomthe melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of thechildrens voices and laughter from the next room evidently some jollyexcitement was going on therefinished finished little natashas gleeful yell rose above them allpierre exchanged glances with countess mary and nicholas natasha henever lost sight of and smiled happilythats delightful music said heit means that anna makarovna has finished her stocking said countessmaryoh ill go and see said pierre jumping up you know he addedstopping at the door why im especially fond of that music it isalways the first thing that tells me all is well when i was drivinghere today the nearer i got to the house the more anxious i grew as ientered the anteroom i heard andrushas peals of laughter and that meantthat all was welli know i know that feeling said nicholas but i mustnt go therethose stockings are to be a surprise for mepierre went to the children and the shouting and laughter grew stillloudercome anna makarovna pierres voice was heard saying come here intothe middle of the room and at the word of command one two and wheni say three you stand here and you in my armswell now onetwo said pierre and a silence followed three and a rapturouslybreathless cry of childrens voices filled the room two two theyshoutedthis meant two stockings which by a secret process known only toherself anna makarovna used to knit at the same time on the sameneedles and which when they were ready she always triumphantly drewone out of the other in the childrens presencesoon after this the children came in to say good night they kissedeveryone the tutors and governesses made their bows and they went outonly young nicholas and his tutor remained dessalles whispered to theboy to come downstairsno monsieur dessalles i will ask my aunt to let me stay repliednicholas bolkonski also in a whisperma tante please let me stay said he going up to his aunthis face expressed entreaty agitation and ecstasy countess maryglanced at him and turned to pierrewhen you are here he cant tear himself away she saidi will bring him to you directly monsieur dessalles good night saidpierre giving his hand to the swiss tutor and he turned to youngnicholas with a smile you and i havent seen anything of one anotheryet how like he is growing mary he added addressing countessmarylike my father asked the boy flushing crimson and looking up atpierre with bright ecstatic eyespierre nodded and went on with what he had been saying when thechildren had interrupted countess mary sat down doing woolwork natashadid not take her eyes off her husband nicholas and denisov rose askedfor their pipes smoked went to fetch more tea from sonyawho satweary but resolute at the samovarand questioned pierre the curlyheaded delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed in a cornerstarting every now and then and muttering something to himself andevidently experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he turned his curlyhead with his thin neck exposed by his turndown collar toward theplace where pierre satthe conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in powerin which most people see the chief interest of home politics denisovdissatisfied with the government on account of his own disappointmentsin the service heard with pleasure of the things done in petersburgwhich seemed to him stupid and made forcible and sharp comments on whatpierre told themone used to have to be a germannow one must dance with tatawinova andmadame kwudener and wead eckatshausen and the bwethwen oh theyshould let that fine fellow bonaparte loosehed knock all thisnonsense out of them fancy giving the command of the semenov wegimentto a fellow like that schwatz he criednicholas though free from denisovs readiness to find fault witheverything also thought that discussion of the government was a veryserious and weighty matter and the fact that a had been appointedminister of this and b governor general of that and that the emperorhad said soandso and this minister soandso seemed to him veryimportant and so he thought it necessary to take an interest in thesethings and to question pierre the questions put by these two kept theconversation from changing its ordinary character of gossip about thehigher government circlesbut natasha knowing all her husbands ways and ideas saw that he hadlong been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation toanother channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake ofwhich he had gone to petersburg to consult with his new friend princetheodore and she helped him by asking how his affairs with princetheodore had gonewhat was it about asked nicholasalways the same thing said pierre looking round at his listenerseverybody sees that things are going so badly that they cannot beallowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent men tocounteract it as far as they canwhat can decent men do nicholas inquired frowning slightly whatcan be donewhy thiscome into my study said nicholasnatasha who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby nowheard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery countess maryfollowed her the men went into the study and little nicholas bolkonskifollowed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing tablein a shady corner by the windowwell what would you do asked denisovalways some fantastic schemes said nicholaswhy this began pierre not sitting down but pacing the roomsometimes stopping short gesticulating and lisping the position inpetersburg is this the emperor does not look into anything he hasabandoned himself altogether to this mysticism pierre could nottolerate mysticism in anyone now he seeks only for peace and onlythese people sans foi ni loi  can give it himpeople who recklesslyhack at and strangle everythingmagnitski arakcheev and tuttiquanti you will agree that if you did not look after your estatesyourself but only wanted a quiet life the harsher your steward was themore readily your object might be attained he said to nicholas without faith or lawwell what does that lead up to said nicholaswell everything is going to ruin robbery in the law courts in thearmy nothing but flogging drilling and military settlements thepeople are tortured enlightenment is suppressed all that is young andhonest is crushed everyone sees that this cannot go on everything isstrained to such a degree that it will certainly break said pierre asthose who examine the actions of any government have always said sincegovernments began i told them just one thing in petersburgtold whomwell you know whom said pierre with a meaning glance from under hisbrows prince theodore and all those to encourage culture andphilanthropy is all very well of course the aim is excellent but in thepresent circumstances something else is neededat that moment nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew his facedarkened and he went up to the boywhy are you herewhy let him be said pierre taking nicholas by the arm andcontinuing that is not enough i told them something else is neededwhen you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at any momentwhen everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe as many aspossible must join hands as closely as they can to withstand the generalcalamity everything that is young and strong is being enticed away anddepraved one is lured by women another by honors a third by ambitionor money and they go over to that camp no independent men such as youor i are left what i say is widen the scope of our society let themot dordre be not virtue alone but independence and action as wellnicholas who had left his nephew irritably pushed up an armchair satdown in it and listened to pierre coughing discontentedly and frowningmore and morebut action with what aim he cried and what position will you adopttoward the governmentwhy the position of assistants the society need not be secret if thegovernment allows it not merely is it not hostile to government but itis a society of true conservativesa society of gentlemen in the fullmeaning of that word it is only to prevent some pugachev or other fromkilling my children and yours and arakcheev from sending me off to somemilitary settlement we join hands only for the public welfare and thegeneral safetyyes but its a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful onewhich can only cause harmwhy did the tugendbund which saved europe they did not then ventureto suggest that russia had saved europe do any harm the tugendbund isan alliance of virtue it is love mutual help it is what christpreached on the crossnatasha who had come in during the conversation looked joyfully at herhusband it was not what he was saying that pleased herthat did noteven interest her for it seemed to her that was all extremely simpleand that she had known it a long time it seemed so to her because sheknew that it sprang from pierres whole soul but it was his animatedand enthusiastic appearance that made her gladthe boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turndown collarwhom everyone had forgottengazed at pierre with even greater and morerapturous joy every word of pierres burned into his heart and with anervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the sealing waxand quill pens his hands came upon on his uncles tableit is not at all what you suppose but that is what the germantugendbund was and what i am proposingno my fwiend the tugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage eatersbut i dont understand it and cant even pwonounce it interposeddenisov in a loud and resolute voice i agwee that evewything here iswotten and howwible but the tugendbund i dont understand if were notsatisfied let us have a bunt of our own thats all wight je suisvote homme  im your manpierre smiled natasha began to laugh but nicholas knitted his browsstill more and began proving to pierre that there was no prospect of anygreat change and that all the danger he spoke of existed only in hisimagination pierre maintained the contrary and as his mental facultieswere greater and more resourceful nicholas felt himself cornered thismade him still angrier for he was fully convinced not by reasoning butby something within him stronger than reason of the justice of hisopinioni will tell you this he said rising and trying with nervouslytwitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner but finallyabandoning the attempt i cant prove it to you you say thateverything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming i dont seeit but you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditionalmatter and to that i reply you are my best friend as you know butif you formed a secret society and began working against the governmentbe it what it mayi know it is my duty to obey the government and ifarakcheev ordered me to lead a squadron against you and cut you down ishould not hesitate an instant but should do it and you may argueabout that as you likean awkward silence followed these words natasha was the first to speakdefending her husband and attacking her brother her defense was weakand inapt but she attained her object the conversation was resumed andno longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of nicholas last remarkwhen they all got up to go in to supper little nicholas bolkonski wentup to pierre pale and with shining radiant eyesuncle pierre you no if papa were alive would he agree withyou he askedand pierre suddenly realized what a special independent complex andpowerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in thisboy during that conversation and remembering all he had said heregretted that the lad should have heard him he had however to givehim an answeryes i think so he said reluctantly and left the studythe lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what hehad done to the things on the table he flushed and went up to nicholasuncle forgive me i did that unintentionally he said pointing tothe broken sealing wax and pensnicholas started angrilyall right all right he said throwing the bits under the tableand evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty he turned awayfrom the boyyou ought not to have been here at all he saidthe conversation at supper was not about politics or societies butturned on the subject nicholas liked bestrecollections of denisov started these and pierre was particularly agreeable and amusingabout them the family separated on the most friendly termsafter supper nicholas having undressed in his study and giveninstructions to the steward who had been waiting for him went to thebedroom in his dressing gown where he found his wife still at hertable writingwhat are you writing mary nicholas askedcountess mary blushed she was afraid that what she was writing wouldnot be understood or approved by her husbandshe had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him but at the sametime was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would now have totell hima diary nicholas she replied handing him a blue exercise bookfilled with her firm bold writinga diary nicholas repeated with a shade of irony and he took up thebookit was in frenchdecember  today when andrusha her eldest boy woke up he did not wishto dress and mademoiselle louise sent for me he was naughty andobstinate i tried threats but he only grew angrier then i took thematter in hand i left him alone and began with nurses help to get theother children up telling him that i did not love him for a long timehe was silent as if astonished then he jumped out of bed ran to me inhis shirt and sobbed so that i could not calm him for a long time itwas plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved meafterwards in the evening when i gave him his ticket he again begancrying piteously and kissing me one can do anything with him bytendernesswhat is a ticket nicholas inquiredi have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening showing howthey have behavednicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him andcontinued to turn over the pages and read in the diary was set downeverything in the childrens lives that seemed noteworthy to theirmother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections oneducational methods they were for the most part quite insignificanttrifles but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either nowthat he read this diary about his children for the first timeunder the date  was enteredmitya was naughty at table papa said he was to have no pudding he hadnone but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others while they wereeating i think that punishment by depriving children of sweets onlydevelops their greediness must tell nicholas thisnicholas put down the book and looked at his wife the radiant eyesgazed at him questioningly would he approve or disapprove of her diarythere could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of hisadmiration for his wifeperhaps it need not be done so pedantically thought nicholas or evendone at all but this untiring continual spiritual effort of which thesole aim was the childrens moral welfare delighted him had nicholasbeen able to analyze his feelings he would have found that his steadytender and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder ather spirituality and at the lofty moral world almost beyond his reachin which she had her beinghe was proud of her intelligence and goodness recognized his owninsignificance beside her in the spiritual world and rejoiced all themore that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part ofhimselfi quite quite approve my dearest said he with a significant lookand after a short pause he added and i behaved badly today youwerent in the study we began disputingpierre and iand i lost mytemper but he is impossible such a child i dont know what wouldbecome of him if natasha didnt keep him in hand have you any ideawhy he went to petersburg they have formedyes i know said countess mary natasha told mewell then you know nicholas went on growing hot at the mererecollection of their discussion he wanted to convince me that it isevery honest mans duty to go against the government and that the oathof allegiance and duty i am sorry you werent there they all fell onmedenisov and natasha natasha is absurd how she rules over himand yet there need only be a discussion and she has no words of her ownbut only repeats his sayings added nicholas yielding to thatirresistible inclination which tempts us to judge those nearest anddearest to us he forgot that what he was saying about natasha couldhave been applied word for word to himself in relation to his wifeyes i have noticed that said countess marywhen i told him that duty and the oath were above everything hestarted proving goodness knows what a pity you were not therewhatwould you have saidas i see it you were quite right and i told natasha so pierre sayseverybody is suffering tortured and being corrupted and that it isour duty to help our neighbor of course he is right there saidcountess mary but he forgets that we have other duties nearer to usduties indicated to us by god himself and that though we might exposeourselves to risks we must not risk our childrenyes thats it thats just what i said to him put in nicholas whofancied he really had said it but they insisted on their own viewlove of ones neighbor and christianityand all this in the presence ofyoung nicholas who had gone into my study and broke all my thingsah nicholas do you know i am often troubled about little nicholassaid countess mary he is such an exceptional boy i am afraid ineglect him in favor of my own we all have children and relations whilehe has no one he is constantly alone with his thoughtswell i dont think you need reproach yourself on his account all thatthe fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are doing forhim and of course i am glad of it he is a fine lad a fine lad thisevening he listened to pierre in a sort of trance and fancyas we weregoing in to supper i looked and he had broken everything on my table tobits and he told me of it himself at once i never knew him to tell anuntruth a fine lad a fine lad repeated nicholas who at heart wasnot fond of nicholas bolkonski but was always anxious to recognize thathe was a fine ladstill i am not the same as his own mother said countess mary ifeel i am not the same and it troubles me a wonderful boy but i amdreadfully afraid for him it would be good for him to have companionswell it wont be for long next summer ill take him to petersburgsaid nicholas yes pierre always was a dreamer and always will be hecontinued returning to the talk in the study which had evidentlydisturbed him well what business is it of mine what goes on therewhether arakcheev is bad and all that what business was it of minewhen i married and was so deep in debt that i was threatened withprison and had a mother who could not see or understand it and thenthere are you and the children and our affairs is it for my ownpleasure that i am at the farm or in the office from morning to nightno but i know i must work to comfort my mother to repay you and notto leave the children such beggars as i wascountess mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread aloneand that he attached too much importance to these matters but she knewshe must not say this and that it would be useless to do so she onlytook his hand and kissed it he took this as a sign of approval and aconfirmation of his thoughts and after a few minutes reflectioncontinued to think aloudyou know mary today elias mitrofanych this was his overseer cameback from the tambov estate and told me they are already offering eightythousand rubles for the forestand with an eager face nicholas began to speak of the possibility ofrepurchasing otradnoe before long and added another ten years of lifeand i shall leave the children in an excellent positioncountess mary listened to her husband and understood all that he toldher she knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimesask her what he had been saying and be vexed if he noticed that she hadbeen thinking about something else but she had to force herself toattend for what he was saying did not interest her at all she lookedat him and did not think but felt about something different she felta submissive tender love for this man who would never understand allthat she understood and this seemed to make her love for him stillstronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness besides thisfeeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from followingthe details of her husbands plans thoughts that had no connection withwhat he was saying flitted through her mind she thought of her nephewher husbands account of the boys agitation while pierre was speakingstruck her forcibly and various traits of his gentle sensitivecharacter recurred to her mind and while thinking of her nephew shethought also of her own children she did not compare them with him butcompared her feeling for them with her feeling for him and felt withregret that there was something lacking in her feeling for youngnicholassometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from thedifference in their ages but she felt herself to blame toward him andpromised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the impossibleinthis life to love her husband her children little nicholas and allher neighbors as christ loved mankind countess marys soul alwaysstrove toward the infinite the eternal and the absolute and couldtherefore never be at peace a stern expression of the lofty secretsuffering of a soul burdened by the body appeared on her face nicholasgazed at her o god what will become of us if she dies as i alwaysfear when her face is like that thought he and placing himself beforethe icon he began to say his evening prayersnatasha and pierre left alone also began to talk as only a husband andwife can talk that is with extraordinary clearness and rapidityunderstanding and expressing each others thoughts in ways contrary toall rules of logic without premises deductions or conclusions and ina quite peculiar way natasha was so used to this kind of talk with herhusband that for her it was the surest sign of something being wrongbetween them if pierre followed a line of logical reasoning when hebegan proving anything or talking argumentatively and calmly and sheled on by his example began to do the same she knew that they were onthe verge of a quarrelfrom the moment they were alone and natasha came up to him with wideopen happy eyes and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her bosomsaying now you are all mine mine you wont escapefrom thatmoment this conversation began contrary to all the laws of logic andcontrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about atone and the same time this simultaneous discussion of many topics didnot prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surestsign that they fully understood one anotherjust as in a dream when all is uncertain unreasoning andcontradictory except the feeling that guides the dream so in thisintercourse contrary to all laws of reason the words themselves werenot consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted themnatasha spoke to pierre about her brothers life and doings of how shehad suffered and lacked life during his own absence and of how she wasfonder than ever of mary and how mary was in every way better thanherself in saying this natasha was sincere in acknowledging maryssuperiority but at the same time by saying it she made a demand onpierre that he should all the same prefer her to mary and to all otherwomen and that now especially after having seen many women inpetersburg he should tell her so afreshpierre answering natashas words told her how intolerable it had beenfor him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in petersburgi have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies he said it wassimply dull besides i was very busynatasha looked intently at him and went onmary is so splendid she said how she understands children it is asif she saw straight into their souls yesterday for instance mitya wasnaughtyhow like his father he is pierre interjectednatasha knew why he mentioned mityas likeness to nicholas therecollection of his dispute with his brotherinlaw was unpleasant andhe wanted to know what natasha thought of itnicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generallyaccepted but i understand that you value what opens up a fresh linesaid she repeating words pierre had once utteredno the chief point is that to nicholas ideas and discussions are anamusementalmost a pastime said pierre for instance he iscollecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book tillhe has read what he had already boughtsismondi and rousseau andmontesquieu he added with a smile you know how much i he beganto soften down what he had said but natasha interrupted him to showthat this was unnecessaryso you say ideas are an amusement to himyes and for me nothing else is serious all the time in petersburg isaw everyone as in a dream when i am taken up by a thought all else ismere amusementah im so sorry i wasnt there when you met the children saidnatasha which was most delighted lisa im sureyes pierre replied and went on with what was in his mind nicholassays we ought not to think but i cant help it besides when i was inpetersburg i felt i can say this to you that the whole affair would goto pieces without meeveryone was pulling his own way but i succeededin uniting them all and then my idea is so clear and simple you see idont say that we ought to oppose this and that we may be mistakenwhat i say is join hands you who love the right and let there be butone bannerthat of active virtue prince sergey is a fine fellow andclevernatasha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of pierres ideabut one thing disconcerted her can a man so important and necessary tosociety be also my husband how did this happen she wished to expressthis doubt to him now who could decide whether he is really clevererthan all the others she asked herself and passed in review all thosewhom pierre most respected judging by what he had said there was no onehe had respected so highly as platon karataevdo you know what i am thinking about she asked about platonkarataev would he have approved of you now do you thinkpierre was not at all surprised at this question he understood hiswifes line of thoughtplaton karataev he repeated and pondered evidently sincerely tryingto imagine karataevs opinion on the subject he would not haveunderstood yet perhaps he wouldi love you awfully natasha suddenly said awfully awfullyno he would not have approved said pierre after reflection whathe would have approved of is our family life he was always so anxiousto find seemliness happiness and peace in everything and i shouldhave been proud to let him see us there nowyou talk of my absencebut you wouldnt believe what a special feeling i have for you after aseparationyes i should think natasha beganno its not that i never leave off loving you and one couldnt lovemore but this is something special yes of course he did notfinish because their eyes meeting said the restwhat nonsense it is natasha suddenly exclaimed about honeymoonsand that the greatest happiness is at first on the contrary now is thebest of all if only you did not go away do you remember how wequarreled and it was always my fault always mine and what wequarreled abouti dont even rememberalways about the same thing said pierre with a smile jealodont say it i cant bear it natasha cried and her eyes glitteredcoldly and vindictively did you see her she added after a pauseno and if i had i shouldnt have recognized herthey were silent for a whileoh do you know while you were talking in the study i was looking atyou natasha began evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that hadcome over them you are as like him as two peaslike the boy shemeant her little son oh its time to go to him the milkscome but im sorry to leave youthey were silent for a few seconds then suddenly turning to one anotherat the same time they both began to speak pierre began with selfsatisfaction and enthusiasm natasha with a quiet happy smile havinginterrupted one another they both stopped to let the other continueno what did you say go on go onno you go on i was talking nonsense said natashapierre finished what he had begun it was the sequel to his complacentreflections on his success in petersburg at that moment it seemed tohim that he was chosen to give a new direction to the whole of russiansociety and to the whole worldi only wished to say that ideas that have great results are alwayssimple ones my whole idea is that if vicious people are united andconstitute a power then honest folk must do the same now thats simpleenoughyesand what were you going to sayi only nonsensebut all the sameoh nothing only a trifle said natasha smilingly still morebrightly i only wanted to tell you about petya today nurse was comingto take him from me and he laughed shut his eyes and clung to me imsure he thought he was hiding awfully sweet there now hes cryingwell goodby and she left the roommeanwhile downstairs in young nicholas bolkonskis bedroom a little lampwas burning as usual the boy was afraid of the dark and they could notcure him of it dessalles slept propped up on four pillows and hisroman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring little nicholas who hadjust waked up in a cold perspiration sat up in bed and gazed before himwith wideopen eyes he had awaked from a terrible dream he had dreamedthat he and uncle pierre wearing helmets such as were depicted in hisplutarch were leading a huge army the army was made up of whiteslanting lines that filled the air like the cobwebs that float about inautumn and which dessalles called les fils de la vierge in front wasglory which was similar to those threads but rather thicker he andpierre were borne along lightly and joyously nearer and nearer to theirgoal suddenly the threads that moved them began to slacken and becomeentangled and it grew difficult to move and uncle nicholas stood beforethem in a stern and threatening attitudehave you done this he said pointing to some broken sealing wax andpens i loved you but i have orders from arakcheev and will kill thefirst of you who moves forward little nicholas turned to look atpierre but pierre was no longer there in his place was his fatherprince andrewand his father had neither shape nor form but heexisted and when little nicholas perceived him he grew faint with

humanity to seize and put intowords to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a singlenation appears impossiblethe ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describeand seize the apparently elusivethe life of a people they describedthe activity of individuals who ruled the people and regarded theactivity of those men as representing the activity of the whole nationthe question how did individuals make nations act as they wished and bywhat was the will of these individuals themselves guided the ancientsmet by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will ofa chosen man and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplishends that were predestinedfor the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the directparticipation of the deity in human affairsmodern history in theory rejects both these principlesit would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in manssubjection to the deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nationsare led modern history should study not the manifestations of power butthe causes that produce it but modern history has not done this havingin theory rejected the view held by the ancients it still follows themin practiceinstead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by thewill of god modern history has given us either heroes endowed withextraordinary superhuman capacities or simply men of very variouskinds from monarchs to journalists who lead the masses instead of theformer divinely appointed aims of the jewish greek or roman nationswhich ancient historians regarded as representing the progress ofhumanity modern history has postulated its own aimsthe welfare of thefrench german or english people or in its highest abstraction thewelfare and civilization of humanity in general by which is usuallymeant that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of alarge continentmodern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients withoutreplacing them by a new conception and the logic of the situation hasobliged the historians after they had apparently rejected the divineauthority of the kings and the fate of the ancients to reach the sameconclusion by another road that is to recognize  nations guided byindividual men and  the existence of a known aim to which thesenations and humanity at large are tendingat the basis of the works of all the modern historians from gibbon tobuckle despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent novelty oftheir outlooks lie those two old unavoidable assumptionsin the first place the historian describes the activity of individualswho in his opinion have directed humanity one historian considers onlymonarchs generals and ministers as being such men while anotherincludes also orators learned men reformers philosophers and poetssecondly it is assumed that the goal toward which humanity is being ledis known to the historians to one of them this goal is the greatness ofthe roman spanish or french realm to another it is liberty equalityand a certain kind of civilization of a small corner of the world calledeuropein  a ferment arises in paris it grows spreads and is expressedby a movement of peoples from west to east several times it moveseastward and collides with a countermovement from the east westward in it reaches its extreme limit moscow and then with remarkablesymmetry a countermovement occurs from east to west attracting to itas the first movement had done the nations of middle europe thecounter movement reaches the starting point of the first movement in thewestparisand subsidesduring that twentyyear period an immense number of fields were leftuntilled houses were burned trade changed its direction millions ofmen migrated were impoverished or were enriched and millions ofchristian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew oneanotherwhat does all this mean why did it happen what made those people burnhouses and slay their fellow men what were the causes of these eventswhat force made men act so these are the instinctive plain and mostlegitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters themonuments and tradition of that periodfor a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to thescience of history whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to knowthemselvesif history had retained the conception of the ancients it would havesaid that god to reward or punish his people gave napoleon power anddirected his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends and that replywould have been clear and complete one might believe or disbelieve inthe divine significance of napoleon but for anyone believing in itthere would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of thatperiod nor would there have been any contradictionsbut modern history cannot give that reply science does not admit theconception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the deityin human affairs and therefore history ought to give other answersmodern history replying to these questions says you want to know whatthis movement means what caused it and what force produced theseevents then listenlouis xiv was a very proud and selfconfident man he had such and suchmistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled france badly hisdescendants were weak men and they too ruled france badly and they hadsuch and such favorites and such and such mistresses moreover certainmen wrote some books at that time at the end of the eighteenth centurythere were a couple of dozen men in paris who began to talk about allmen being free and equal this caused people all over france to begin toslash at and drown one another they killed the king and many otherpeople at that time there was in france a man of geniusnapoleon heconquered everybody everywherethat is he killed many people becausehe was a great genius and for some reason he went to kill africans andkilled them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned tofrance he ordered everybody to obey him and they all obeyed him havingbecome an emperor he again went out to kill people in italy austriaand prussia and there too he killed a great many in russia there wasan emperor alexander who decided to restore order in europe andtherefore fought against napoleon in  he suddenly made friends withhim but in  they again quarreled and again began killing manypeople napoleon led six hundred thousand men into russia and capturedmoscow then he suddenly ran away from moscow and the emperoralexander helped by the advice of stein and others united europe toarm against the disturber of its peace all napoleons allies suddenlybecame his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces heraised the allies defeated napoleon entered paris forced napoleon toabdicate and sent him to the island of elba not depriving him of thetitle of emperor and showing him every respect though five years beforeand one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigandthen louis xviii who till then had been the laughingstock both of thefrench and the allies began to reign and napoleon shedding tearsbefore his old guards renounced the throne and went into exile thenthe skillful statesmen and diplomatists especially talleyrand whomanaged to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and therebyextended the frontiers of france talked in vienna and by theseconversations made the nations happy or unhappy suddenly thediplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point ofagain ordering their armies to kill one another but just then napoleonarrived in france with a battalion and the french who had been hatinghim immediately all submitted to him but the allied monarchs wereangry at this and went to fight the french once more and they defeatedthe genius napoleon and suddenly recognizing him as a brigand sent himto the island of st helena and the exile separated from the belovedfrance so dear to his heart died a lingering death on that rock andbequeathed his great deeds to posterity but in europe a reactionoccurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress theirsubjectsit would be a mistake to think that this is ironica caricature of thehistorical accounts on the contrary it is a very mild expression of thecontradictory replies not meeting the questions which all thehistorians give from the compilers of memoirs and the histories ofseparate states to the writers of general histories and the newhistories of the culture of that periodthe strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact thatmodern history like a deaf man answers questions no one has askedif the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement ofhumanity and of the peoples the first questionin the absence of areply to which all the rest will be incomprehensibleis what is thepower that moves peoples to this modern history laboriously replieseither that napoleon was a great genius or that louis xiv was veryproud or that certain writers wrote certain booksall that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it but it is notwhat was asked all that would be interesting if we recognized a divinepower based on itself and always consistently directing its nationsthrough napoleons louises and writers but we do not acknowledge sucha power and therefore before speaking about napoleons louises andauthors we ought to be shown the connection existing between these menand the movement of the nationsif instead of a divine power some other force has appeared it should beexplained in what this new force consists for the whole interest ofhistory lies precisely in that forcehistory seems to assume that this force is selfevident and known toeveryone but in spite of every desire to regard it as known anyonereading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this newforce so variously understood by the historians themselves is reallyquite well known to everybodywhat force moves the nationsbiographical historians and historians of separate nations understandthis force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers in their narrationevents occur solely by the will of a napoleon and alexander or ingeneral of the persons they describe the answers given by this kind ofhistorian to the question of what force causes events to happen aresatisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each eventas soon as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begin todescribe the same event the replies they give immediately lose allmeaning for this force is understood by them all not only differentlybut often in quite contradictory ways one historian says that an eventwas produced by napoleons power another that it was produced byalexanders a third that it was due to the power of some other personbesides this historians of that kind contradict each other even intheir statement as to the force on which the authority of someparticular person was based thiers a bonapartist says that napoleonspower was based on his virtue and genius lanfrey a republican says itwas based on his trickery and deception of the people so the historiansof this class by mutually destroying one anothers positions destroythe understanding of the force which produces events and furnish noreply to historys essential questionwriters of universal history who deal with all the nations seem torecognize how erroneous is the specialist historians view of the forcewhich produces events they do not recognize it as a power inherent inheroes and rulers but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variouslydirected forces in describing a war or the subjugation of a people ageneral historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power ofone man but in the interaction of many persons connected with theeventaccording to this view the power of historical personages representedas the product of many forces can no longer it would seem be regardedas a force that itself produces events yet in most cases universalhistorians still employ the conception of power as a force that itselfproduces events and treat it as their cause in their exposition anhistoric character is first the product of his time and his power onlythe resultant of various forces and then his power is itself a forceproducing events gervinus schlosser and others for instance at onetime prove napoleon to be a product of the revolution of the ideas of and so forth and at another plainly say that the campaign of and other things they do not like were simply the product of napoleonsmisdirected will and that the very ideas of  were arrested in theirdevelopment by napoleons caprice the ideas of the revolution and thegeneral temper of the age produced napoleons power but napoleonspower suppressed the ideas of the revolution and the general temper ofthe agethis curious contradiction is not accidental not only does it occur atevery step but the universal historians accounts are all made up of achain of such contradictions this contradiction occurs because afterentering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfwayto find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force thesum of the components must equal the resultant this condition is neverobserved by the universal historians and so to explain the resultantforces they are obliged to admit in addition to the insufficientcomponents another unexplained force affecting the resultant actionspecialist historians describing the campaign of  or the restorationof the bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by thewill of alexander but the universal historian gervinus refuting thisopinion of the specialist historian tries to prove that the campaign of and the restoration of the bourbons were due to other things besidealexanders willsuch as the activity of stein metternich madame destael talleyrand fichte chateaubriand and others the historianevidently decomposes alexanders power into the components talleyrandchateaubriand and the restbut the sum of the components that is theinteractions of chateaubriand talleyrand madame de stael and theothers evidently does not equal the resultant namely the phenomenon ofmillions of frenchmen submitting to the bourbons that chateaubriandmadame de stael and others spoke certain words to one another onlyaffected their mutual relations but does not account for the submissionof millions and therefore to explain how from these relations of theirsthe submission of millions of people resultedthat is how componentforces equal to one a gave a resultant equal to a thousand times athehistorian is again obliged to fall back on powerthe force he haddeniedand to recognize it as the resultant of the forces that is hehas to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant and that isjust what the universal historians do and consequently they not onlycontradict the specialist historians but contradict themselvespeasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain say according towhether they want rain or fine weather the wind has blown the cloudsaway or the wind has brought up the clouds and in the same way theuniversal historians sometimes when it pleases them and fits in withtheir theory say that power is the result of events and sometimeswhen they want to prove something else say that power produces eventsa third class of historiansthe socalled historians of culturefollowing the path laid down by the universal historians who sometimesaccept writers and ladies as forces producing eventsagain take thatforce to be something quite different they see it in what is calledculturein mental activitythe historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to theirprogenitors the writers of universal histories for if historicalevents may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated oneanother in such and such ways why not explain them by the fact thatsuch and such people wrote such and such books of the immense number ofindications accompanying every vital phenomenon these historians selectthe indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication isthe cause but despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of eventslies in intellectual activity only by a great stretch can one admitthat there is any connection between intellectual activity and themovement of peoples and in no case can one admit that intellectualactivity controls peoples actions for that view is not confirmed bysuch facts as the very cruel murders of the french revolution resultingfrom the doctrine of the equality of man or the very cruel wars andexecutions resulting from the preaching of lovebut even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments withwhich these histories are filledadmitting that nations are governed bysome undefined force called an ideahistorys essential question stillremains unanswered and to the former power of monarchs and to theinfluence of advisers and other people introduced by the universalhistorians another newer forcethe ideais added the connection ofwhich with the masses needs explanation it is possible to understandthat napoleon had power and so events occurred with some effort one mayeven conceive that napoleon together with other influences was the causeof an event but how a book le contrat social had the effect of makingfrenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without anexplanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the eventundoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneouslyand so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectualactivity of men and their historical movements just as such aconnection may be found between the movements of humanity and commercehandicraft gardening or anything else you please but why intellectualactivity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause orexpression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand onlythe following considerations can have led the historians to such aconclusion  that history is written by learned men and so it isnatural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their classsupplies the basis of the movement of all humanity just as a similarbelief is natural and agreeable to traders agriculturists and soldiersif they do not express it that is merely because traders and soldiersdo not write history and  that spiritual activity enlightenmentcivilization culture ideas are all indistinct indefinite conceptionsunder whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still lessdefinite meaning and which can therefore be readily introduced into anytheorybut not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kindwhich may possibly even be of use to someone for something thehistories of culture to which all general histories tend more and moreto approximate are significant from the fact that after seriously andminutely examining various religious philosophic and politicaldoctrines as causes of events as soon as they have to describe anactual historic event such as the campaign of  for instance theyinvoluntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of powerandsay plainly that that was the result of napoleons will speaking sothe historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves and showthat the new force they have devised does not account for what happensin history and that history can only be explained by introducing apower which they apparently do not recognizea locomotive is moving someone asks what moves it a peasant saysthe devil moves it another man says the locomotive moves because itswheels go round a third asserts that the cause of its movement lies inthe smoke which the wind carries awaythe peasant is irrefutable he has devised a complete explanation torefute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil oranother peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devilbut a german who moves the locomotive only then as a result of thecontradiction will they see that they are both wrong but the man whosays that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself forhaving once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further whythe wheels go round and till he has reached the ultimate cause of themovement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler hehas no right to stop in his search for the cause the man who explainsthe movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back hasnoticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken thefirst sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offered that as anexplanationthe only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive isthat of a force commensurate with the movement observedthe only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is thatof some force commensurate with the whole movement of the peoplesyet to supply this conception various historians take forces ofdifferent kinds all of which are incommensurate with the movementobserved some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes as thepeasant sees the devil in the locomotive others as a force resultingfrom several other forces like the movement of the wheels others againas an intellectual influence like the smoke that is blown awayso long as histories are written of separate individuals whethercaesars alexanders luthers or voltaires and not the histories ofall absolutely all those who take part in an event it is quiteimpossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conceptionof a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain endand the only such conception known to historians is that of powerthis conception is the one handle by means of which the material ofhistory as at present expounded can be dealt with and anyone whobreaks that handle off as buckle did without finding some other methodof treating historical material merely deprives himself of the onepossible way of dealing with it the necessity of the conception ofpower as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by theuniversal historians and historians of culture themselves for theyprofessedly reject that conception but inevitably have recourse to it atevery stepin dealing with humanitys inquiry the science of history up to now islike money in circulationpaper money and coin the biographies andspecial national histories are like paper money they can be used andcan circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and evenadvantageously as long as no one asks what is the security behind themyou need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events andsuch histories as thiers will be interesting and instructive and mayperhaps even possess a tinge of poetry but just as doubts of the realvalue of paper money arise either because being easy to make too muchof it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold so alsodoubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either becausetoo many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heartsomeone inquires by what force did napoleon do thisthat is wants toexchange the current paper money for the real gold of actualcomprehensionthe writers of universal histories and of the history of culture arelike people who recognizing the defects of paper money decide tosubstitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravityof gold it may indeed make jingling coin but will do no more thanthat paper money may deceive the ignorant but nobody is deceived bytokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle as gold isgold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for useso universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply tohistorys essential question what is power the universal historiansgive contradictory replies to that question while the historians ofculture evade it and answer something quite different and as countersof imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree toaccept them as gold or among those who do not know the nature of goldso universal historians and historians of culture not answeringhumanitys essential question serve as currency for some purposes oftheir own only in universities and among the mass of readers who have ataste for what they call serious readinghaving abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divinesubjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjectionof that mans will to the deity history cannot without contradictionstake a single step till it has chosen one of two things either a returnto the former belief in the direct intervention of the deity in humanaffairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producinghistorical events and termed powera return to the first is impossible the belief has been destroyed andso it is essential to explain what is meant by powernapoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war we are soaccustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the questionwhy did six hundred thousand men go to fight when napoleon utteredcertain words seems to us senseless he had the power and so what heordered was donethis reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was givenhim by god but as soon as we do not admit that it becomes essential todetermine what is this power of one man over othersit cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak onea domination based on the application or threat of physical force likethe power of hercules nor can it be based on the effect of moral forceas in their simplicity some historians think who say that the leadingfigures in history are heroes that is men gifted with a specialstrength of soul and mind called genius this power cannot be based onthe predominance of moral strength for not to mention heroes such asnapoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely historyshows us that neither a louis xi nor a metternich who ruled overmillions of people had any particular moral qualities but on thecontrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions theyruled overif the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moralqualities of him who possesses it it must evidently be looked forelsewherein the relation to the people of the man who wields thepowerand that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudencethat exchange bank of history which offers to exchange historysunderstanding of power for true goldpower is the collective will of the people transferred by expressed ortacit consent to their chosen rulersin the domain of jurisprudence which consists of discussions of how astate and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to bearranged it is all very clear but when applied to history thatdefinition of power needs explanationthe science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancientsregarded firenamely as something existing absolutely but forhistory the state and power are merely phenomena just as for modernphysics fire is not an element but a phenomenonfrom this fundamental difference between the view held by history andthat held by jurisprudence it follows that jurisprudence can tellminutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what powerexisting immutably outside timeis but to historys questions aboutthe meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer nothingif power be the collective will of the people transferred to theirruler was pugachev a representative of the will of the people if notthen why was napoleon i why was napoleon iii a criminal when he wastaken prisoner at boulogne and why later on were those criminals whomhe arresteddo palace revolutionsin which sometimes only two or three people takeparttransfer the will of the people to a new ruler in internationalrelations is the will of the people also transferred to theirconqueror was the will of the confederation of the rhine transferred tonapoleon in  was the will of the russian people transferred tonapoleon in  when our army in alliance with the french went tofight the austriansto these questions three answers are possibleeither to assume  that the will of the people is alwaysunconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen andthat therefore every emergence of a new power every struggle againstthe power once appointed should be absolutely regarded as aninfringement of the real power or  that the will of the people istransferred to the rulers conditionally under definite and knownconditions and to show that all limitations conflicts and evendestructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of theconditions under which their power was entrusted to them or  thatthe will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally butthat the conditions are unknown and indefinite and that the appearanceof several authorities their struggles and their falls result solelyfrom the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknownconditions on which the will of the people is transferred from somepeople to othersand these are the three ways in which the historians do explain therelation of the people to their rulerssome historiansthose biographical and specialist historians alreadyreferred toin their simplicity failing to understand the question ofthe meaning of power seem to consider that the collective will of thepeople is unconditionally transferred to historical persons andtherefore when describing some single state they assume that particularpower to be the one absolute and real power and that any other forceopposing this is not a power but a violation of powermere violencetheir theory suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of historyhas the inconveniencein application to complex and stormy periods inthe life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously andstruggle with one anotherthat a legitimist historian will prove thatthe national convention the directory and bonaparte were mereinfringers of the true power while a republican and a bonapartist willprove the one that the convention and the other that the empire was thereal power and that all the others were violations of power evidentlythe explanations furnished by these historians being mutuallycontradictory can only satisfy young childrenrecognizing the falsity of this view of history another set ofhistorians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the willof the people to their rulers and that historical leaders have poweronly conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of thepeople has by tacit agreement prescribed to them but what this programconsists in these historians do not say or if they do they continuallycontradict one anothereach historian according to his view of what constitutes a nationsprogress looks for these conditions in the greatness wealth freedomor enlightenment of citizens of france or some other country but not tomention the historians contradictions as to the nature of this programor even admitting that some one general program of these conditionsexiststhe facts of history almost always contradict that theory ifthe conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the wealthfreedom and enlightenment of the people how is it that louis xiv andivan the terrible end their reigns tranquilly while louis xvi andcharles i are executed by their people to this question historiansreply that louis xivs activity contrary to the program reacted onlouis xvi but why did it not react on louis xiv or on louis xvwhyshould it react just on louis xvi and what is the time limit for suchreactions to these questions there are and can be no answers equallylittle does this view explain why for several centuries the collectivewill is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs and thensuddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to theconvention to the directory to napoleon to alexander to louis xviiito napoleon again to charles x to louis philippe to a republicangovernment and to napoleon iii when explaining these rapid transfersof the peoples will from one individual to another especially in viewof international relations conquests and alliances the historians areobliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegationsof the peoples will but are accidents dependent on cunning onmistakes on craft or on the weakness of a diplomatist a ruler or aparty leader so that the greater part of the events of historycivilwars revolutions and conquestsare presented by these historians notas the results of free transferences of the peoples will but asresults of the illdirected will of one or more individuals that isonce again as usurpations of power and so these historians also seeand admit historical events which are exceptions to the theorythese historians resemble a botanist who having noticed that someplants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons should insist that allthat grows does so by sprouting into two leaves and that the palm themushroom and even the oak which blossom into full growth and no longerresemble two leaves are deviations from the theoryhistorians of the third class assume that the will of the people istransferred to historic personages conditionally but that theconditions are unknown to us they say that historical personages havepower only because they fulfill the will of the people which has beendelegated to thembut in that case if the force that moves nations lies not in thehistoric leaders but in the nations themselves what significance havethose leadersthe leaders these historians tell us express the will of the peoplethe activity of the leaders represents the activity of the peoplebut in that case the question arises whether all the activity of theleaders serves as an expression of the peoples will or only some partof it if the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression ofthe peoples will as some historians suppose then all the details ofthe court scandals contained in the biographies of a napoleon or acatherine serve to express the life of the nation which is evidentnonsense but if it is only some particular side of the activity of anhistorical leader which serves to express the peoples life as othersocalled philosophical historians believe then to determine whichside of the activity of a leader expresses the nations life we havefirst of all to know in what the nations life consistsmet by this difficulty historians of that class devise some mostobscure impalpable and general abstraction which can cover allconceivable occurrences and declare this abstraction to be the aim ofhumanitys movement the most usual generalizations adopted by almostall the historians are freedom equality enlightenment progresscivilization and culture postulating some generalization as the goalof the movement of humanity the historians study the men of whom thegreatest number of monuments have remained kings ministers generalsauthors reformers popes and journalists to the extent to which intheir opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstractionbut as it is in no way proved that the aim of humanity does consist infreedom equality enlightenment or civilization and as the connectionof the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only basedon the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people isalways transferred to the men whom we have noticed it happens that theactivity of the millions who migrate burn houses abandon agricultureand destroy one another never is expressed in the account of theactivity of some dozen people who did not burn houses practiceagriculture or slay their fellow creatureshistory proves this at every turn is the ferment of the peoples of thewest at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastwardexplained by the activity of louis xiv xv and xvi their mistressesand ministers and by the lives of napoleon rousseau diderotbeaumarchais and othersis the movement of the russian people eastward to kazan and siberiaexpressed by details of the morbid character of ivan the terrible and byhis correspondence with kurbskiis the movement of the peoples at the time of the crusades explained bythe life and activity of the godfreys and the louises and their ladiesfor us that movement of the peoples from west to east without leaderswith a crowd of vagrants and with peter the hermit remainsincomprehensible and yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of thatmovement when a rational and sacred aim for the crusadethe deliveranceof jerusalemhad been clearly defined by historic leaders popeskings and knights incited the peoples to free the holy land but thepeople did not go for the unknown cause which had previously impelledthem to go no longer existed the history of the godfreys and theminnesingers can evidently not cover the life of the peoples and thehistory of the godfreys and the minnesingers has remained the history ofgodfreys and minnesingers but the history of the life of the peoplesand their impulses has remained unknownstill less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us thelife of the peoplesthe history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions oflife and thought of a writer or a reformer we learn that luther had ahot temper and said such and such things we learn that rousseau wassuspicious and wrote such and such books but we do not learn why afterthe reformation the peoples massacred one another nor why during thefrench revolution they guillotined one anotherif we unite both these kinds of history as is done by the newesthistorians we shall have the history of monarchs and writers but notthe history of the life of the peoplesthe life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men forthe connection between those men and the nations has not been found thetheory that this connection is based on the transference of thecollective will of a people to certain historical personages is anhypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of historythe theory of the transference of the collective will of the people tohistoric persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudenceand be essential for its purposes but in its application to history assoon as revolutions conquests or civil wars occurthat is as soon ashistory beginsthat theory explains nothingthe theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of thepeoples will cannot be verified for it never occurredwhatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs thetheory can always say that such and such a person took the lead becausethe collective will was transferred to himthe replies this theory gives to historical questions are like thereplies of a man who watching the movements of a herd of cattle andpaying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in differentparts of the field or to the driving of the herdsman should attributethe direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its headthe herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads itand the collective will of all the other animals is vested in thatleader this is what historians of the first class saythose whoassume the unconditional transference of the peoples willif the animals leading the herd change this happens because thecollective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader toanother according to whether the animal is or is not leading them inthe direction selected by the whole herd such is the reply historianswho assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to rulersunder conditions which they regard as known with this method ofobservation it often happens that the observer influenced by thedirection he himself prefers regards those as leaders who owing to thepeoples change of direction are no longer in front but on one sideor even in the rearif the animals in front are continually changing and the direction ofthe whole herd is constantly altered this is because in order to followa given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals thathave attracted our attention and to study the movements of the herd wemust watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on allsides of the herd so say the third class of historians who regard allhistorical persons from monarchs to journalists as the expression oftheir agethe theory of the transference of the will of the people to historicpersons is merely a paraphrasea restatement of the question in otherwordswhat causes historical events power what is power power is thecollective will of the people transferred to one person under whatcondition is the will of the people delegated to one person oncondition that that person expresses the will of the whole people thatis power is power in other words power is a word the meaning of whichwe do not understandif the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoningthen having subjected to criticism the explanation of power thatjuridical science gives us humanity would conclude that power is merelya word and has no real existence but to understand phenomena man hasbesides abstract reasoning experience by which he verifies hisreflections and experience tells us that power is not merely a word butan actually existing phenomenonnot to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activityof men can do without the conception of power the existence of power isproved both by history and by observing contemporary eventswhenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear by whose will theevent seems to have taken place napoleon iii issues a decree and thefrench go to mexico the king of prussia and bismarck issue decrees andan army enters bohemia napoleon i issues a decree and an army entersrussia alexander i gives a command and the french submit to thebourbons experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is alwaysrelated to the will of one or of several men who have decreed itthe historians in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divineintervention in human affairs want to see the cause of events in theexpression of the will of someone endowed with power but thatsupposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experienceon the one side reflection shows that the expression of a mans willhis wordsare only part of the general activity expressed in an eventas for instance in a war or a revolution and so without assuming anincomprehensible supernatural forcea miracleone cannot admit thatwords can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of men onthe other hand even if we admitted that words could be the cause ofevents history shows that the expression of the will of historicalpersonages does not in most cases produce any effect that is to saytheir commands are often not executed and sometimes the very oppositeof what they order occurswithout admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity wecannot regard power as the cause of eventspower from the standpoint of experience is merely the relation thatexists between the expression of someones will and the execution ofthat will by othersto explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish aconception of the expression of will referring it to man and not to thedeityif the deity issues a command expresses his will as ancient historytells us the expression of that will is independent of time and is notcaused by anything for the divinity is not controlled by an event butspeaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men actingin time and in relation to one another to explain the connection ofcommands with events we must restore  the condition of all thattakes place the continuity of movement in time both of the events andof the person who commands and  the inevitability of the connectionbetween the person commanding and those who execute his commandonly the expression of the will of the deity not dependent on time canrelate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years orcenturies and only the deity independent of everything can by hissole will determine the direction of humanitys movement but man actsin time and himself takes part in what occursreinstating the first condition omitted that of time we see that nocommand can be executed without some preceding order having been givenrendering the execution of the last command possibleno command ever appears spontaneously or itself covers a whole seriesof occurrences but each command follows from another and never refersto a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an eventwhen for instance we say that napoleon ordered armies to go to war wecombine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutivecommands dependent one on another napoleon could not have commanded aninvasion of russia and never did so today he ordered such and suchpapers to be written to vienna to berlin and to petersburg tomorrowsuch and such decrees and orders to the army the fleet thecommissariat and so on and so onmillions of commands which formed awhole series corresponding to a series of events which brought thefrench armies into russiaif throughout his reign napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion ofengland and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effortand yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute thatdesign but undertook an expedition into russia with which country heconsidered it desirable to be in alliance a conviction he repeatedlyexpressedthis came about because his commands did not correspond tothe course of events in the first case but did so correspond in thelatterfor an order to be certainly executed it is necessary that a man shouldorder what can be executed but to know what can and what cannot beexecuted is impossible not only in the case of napoleons invasion ofrussia in which millions participated but even in the simplest eventfor in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent itsexecution every order executed is always one of an immense numberunexecuted all the impossible orders inconsistent with the course ofevents remain unexecuted only the possible ones get linked up with aconsecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events andare executedour false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedesit is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out ofthousands of others those few commands which were consistent with thatevent have been executed we forget about the others that were notexecuted because they could not be apart from that the chief source ofour error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historicalaccounts a whole series of innumerable diverse and petty events suchfor instance as all those which led the french armies to russia isgeneralized into one event in accord with the result produced by thatseries of events and corresponding with this generalization the wholeseries of commands is also generalized into a single expression of willwe say that napoleon wished to invade russia and invaded it in realityin all napoleons activity we never find anything resembling anexpression of that wish but find a series of orders or expressions ofhis will very variously and indefinitely directed amid a long seriesof unexecuted orders of napoleons one series for the campaign of was carried outnot because those orders differed in any way from theother unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course ofevents that led the french army into russia just as in stencil workthis or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on fromthis side or in that way but because it was laid on from all sides overthe figure cut in the stencilso that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events wefind that a command can never be the cause of the event but that acertain definite dependence exists between the twoto understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary toreinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not fromthe deity but from a man which is that the man who gives the commandhimself takes part in the eventthis relation of the commander to those he commands is just what iscalled power this relation consists in the followingfor common action people always unite in certain combinations in whichregardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action therelation between those taking part in it is always the samemen uniting in these combinations always assume such relations towardone another that the larger number take a more direct share and thesmaller number a less direct share in the collective action for whichthey have combinedof all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one ofthe most striking and definite examples is an armyevery army is composed of lower grades of the servicethe rank andfileof whom there are always the greatest number of the next highermilitary rankcorporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there arefewer and of stillhigher officers of whom there are still fewer andso on to the highest military command which is concentrated in onepersona military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone ofwhich the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and filethe next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the nexthigher grades of the army and so on to the apex the point of whichwill represent the commanderinchiefthe soldiers of whom there are the most form the lower section of thecone and its base the soldier himself does the stabbing hackingburning and pillaging and always receives orders for these actionsfrom men above him he himself never gives an order the noncommissionedofficers of whom there are fewer perform the action itself lessfrequently than the soldiers but they already give commands an officerstill less often acts directly himself but commands still morefrequently a general does nothing but command the troops indicates theobjective and hardly ever uses a weapon himself the commanderinchiefnever takes direct part in the action itself but only gives generalorders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops a similarrelation of people to one another is seen in every combination of menfor common activityin agriculture trade and every administrationand so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of acone and of the ranks of an army or the ranks and positions in anyadministrative or public business whatever from the lowest to thehighest we see a law by which men to take associated action combinein such relations that the more directly they participate in performingthe action the less they can command and the more numerous they arewhile the less their direct participation in the action itself the morethey command and the fewer of them there are rising in this way fromthe lowest ranks to the man at the top who takes the least direct sharein the action and directs his activity chiefly to commandingthis relation of the men who command to those they command is whatconstitutes the essence of the conception called powerhaving restored the condition of time under which all events occur wefind that a command is executed only when it is related to acorresponding series of events restoring the essential condition ofrelation between those who command and those who execute we find thatby the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest partin the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed tocommandingwhen an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishesabout it and as the event results from the collective activity of manypeople some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to befulfilled if but approximately when one of the opinions expressed isfulfilled that opinion gets connected with the event as a commandpreceding itmen are hauling a log each of them expresses his opinion as to how andwhere to haul it they haul the log away and it happens that this isdone as one of them said he ordered it there we have command and powerin their primary form the man who worked most with his hands could notthink so much about what he was doing or reflect on or command whatwould result from the common activity while the man who commanded morewould evidently work less with his hands on account of his greaterverbal activitywhen some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aimthere is a yet sharper division of those who because their activity isgiven to directing and commanding take less part in the direct workwhen a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections whichas it seems to him directed his past activity justify his presentactivity and guide him in planning his future actions just the same isdone by a concourse of people allowing those who do not take a directpart in the activity to devise considerations justifications andsurmises concerning their collective activityfor reasons known or unknown to us the french began to drown and killone another and corresponding to the event its justification appears inpeoples belief that this was necessary for the welfare of france forliberty and for equality people ceased to kill one another and thisevent was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for acentralization of power resistance to europe and so on men went fromthe west to the east killing their fellow men and the event wasaccompanied by phrases about the glory of france the baseness ofengland and so on history shows us that these justifications of theevents have no common sense and are all contradictory as in the case ofkilling a man as the result of recognizing his rights and the killingof millions in russia for the humiliation of england but thesejustifications have a very necessary significance in their own daythese justifications release those who produce the events from moralresponsibility these temporary aims are like the broom fixed in frontof a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front they clearmens moral responsibilities from their pathwithout such justification there would be no reply to the simplestquestion that presents itself when examining each historical event howis it that millions of men commit collective crimesmake war commitmurder and so onwith the present complex forms of political and social life in europecan any event that is not prescribed decreed or ordered by monarchsministers parliaments or newspapers be imagined is there anycollective action which cannot find its justification in politicalunity in patriotism in the balance of power or in civilization sothat every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressedwish and receiving a justification presents itself as the result ofthe will of one man or of several menin whatever direction a ship moves the flow of the waves it cuts willalways be noticeable ahead of it to those on board the ship themovement of those waves will be the only perceptible motiononly by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that flow andcomparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves thatevery bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship andthat we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves wereimperceptibly movingwe see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historicalcharacters that is reestablish the inevitable condition of all thatoccursthe continuity of movement in time and do not lose sight of theessential connection of historical persons with the masseswhen the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same waveahead of it when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turnsfrequently but wherever it may turn there always will be the waveanticipating its movementwhatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen anddecreed wherever the ship may go the rush of water which neitherdirects nor increases its movement foams ahead of it and at a distanceseems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the shipsmovement alsoexamining only those expressions of the will of historical personswhich as commands were related to events historians have assumed thatthe events depended on those commands but examining the eventsthemselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood tothe people we have found that they and their orders were dependent onevents the incontestable proof of this deduction is that however manycommands were issued the event does not take place unless there areother causes for it but as soon as an event occursbe it what it maythen out of all the continually expressed wishes of different peoplesome will always be found which by their meaning and their time ofutterance are related as commands to the eventsarriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively tothese two essential questions of history what is power what force produces the movement of the nations power is the relation of a given person to other individuals inwhich the more this person expresses opinions predictions andjustifications of the collective action that is performed the less ishis participation in that action the movement of nations is caused not by power nor by intellectualactivity nor even by a combination of the two as historians havesupposed but by the activity of all the people who participate in theevents and who always combine in such a way that those taking thelargest direct share in the event take on themselves the leastresponsibility and vice versamorally the wielder of power appears to cause the event physically itis those who submit to the power but as the moral activity isinconceivable without the physical the cause of the event is neither inthe one nor in the other but in the union of the twoor in other words the conception of a cause is inapplicable to thephenomena we are examiningin the last analysis we reach the circle of infinitythat final limitto which in every domain of thought mans reason arrives if it is notplaying with the subject electricity produces heat heat produceselectricity atoms attract each other and atoms repel one anotherspeaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms wecannot say why this occurs and we say that it is so because it isinconceivable otherwise because it must be so and that it is a law thesame applies to historical events why war and revolution occur we donot know we only know that to produce the one or the other actionpeople combine in a certain formation in which they all take part andwe say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise or in otherwords that it is a lawif history dealt only with external phenomena the establishment of thissimple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished ourargument but the law of history relates to man a particle of mattercannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsionand that that law is untrue but man who is the subject of historysays plainly i am free and am therefore not subject to the lawthe presence of the problem of mans free will though unexpressed isfelt at every step of historyall seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered thisquestion all the contradictions and obscurities of history and thefalse path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack ofa solution of that questionif the will of every man were free that is if each man could act as hepleased all history would be a series of disconnected incidentsif in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely thatis as he chose it is evident that one single free act of that mans inviolation of the laws governing human action would destroy thepossibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanityif there be a single law governing the actions of men free will cannotexist for then mans will is subject to that lawin this contradiction lies the problem of free will which from mostancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancienttimes has been presented in its whole tremendous significancethe problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation fromwhatever point of viewtheological historical ethical orphilosophicwe find a general law of necessity to which he like allthat exists is subject but regarding him from within ourselves as whatwe are conscious of we feel ourselves to be freethis consciousness is a source of selfcognition quite apart from andindependent of reason through his reason man observes himself but onlythrough consciousness does he know himselfapart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reasonis conceivableto understand observe and draw conclusions man must first of all beconscious of himself as living a man is only conscious of himself as aliving being by the fact that he wills that is is conscious of hisvolition but his willwhich forms the essence of his lifemanrecognizes and can but recognize as freeif observing himself man sees that his will is always directed by oneand the same law whether he observes the necessity of taking foodusing his brain or anything else he cannot recognize this nevervarying direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation of it wereit not free it could not be limited a mans will seems to him to belimited just because he is not conscious of it except as freeyou say i am not free but i have lifted my hand and let it falleveryone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutabledemonstration of freedomthat reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject toreasonif the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independentsource of selfconsciousness it would be subject to reasoning and toexperience but in fact such subjection does not exist and isinconceivablea series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he as anobject of observation is subject to certain laws and man submits tothem and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he hasbecome acquainted with them but the same series of experiments andarguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he isconscious in himself is impossible and that his every action depends onhis organization his character and the motives acting upon him yetman never submits to the deductions of these experiments and argumentshaving learned from experiment and argument that a stone fallsdownwards a man indubitably believes this and always expects the lawthat he has learned to be fulfilledbut learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws he doesnot and cannot believe thishowever often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under thesame conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing asbefore yet when under the same conditions and with the same characterhe approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in thesame way he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment thathe can act as he pleases every man savage or sage howeverincontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it isimpossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely thesame conditions feels that without this irrational conception whichconstitutes the essence of freedom he cannot imagine life he feelsthat however impossible it may be it is so for without this conceptionof freedom not only would he be unable to understand life but he wouldbe unable to live for a single momenthe could not live because all mans efforts all his impulses to lifeare only efforts to increase freedom wealth and poverty fame andobscurity power and subordination strength and weakness health anddisease culture and ignorance work and leisure repletion and hungervirtue and vice are only greater or lesser degrees of freedoma man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived oflifeif the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senselesscontradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one andthe same instant of time or of an effect without a cause that onlyproves that consciousness is not subject to reasonthis unshakable irrefutable consciousness of freedom uncontrolled byexperiment or argument recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyonewithout exception this consciousness without which no conception of manis possible constitutes the other side of the questionman is the creation of an allpowerful allgood and allseeing godwhat is sin the conception of which arises from the consciousness ofmans freedom that is a question for theologythe actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed instatistics what is mans responsibility to society the conception ofwhich results from the conception of freedom that is a question forjurisprudencemans actions proceed from his innate character and the motives actingupon him what is conscience and the perception of right and wrong inactions that follows from the consciousness of freedom that is aquestion for ethicsman in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject tolaws which determine that life but the same man apart from thatconnection appears to be free how should the past life of nations andof humanity be regardedas the result of the free or as the result ofthe constrained activity of man that is a question for historyonly in our selfconfident day of the popularization of knowledgethanks to that most powerful engine of ignorance the diffusion ofprinted matterhas the question of the freedom of will been put on alevel on which the question itself cannot exist in our time themajority of socalled advanced peoplethat is the crowd ofignoramuseshave taken the work of the naturalists who deal with oneside of the question for a solution of the whole problemthey say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist forthe life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscularmovements are conditioned by the activity of the nerves the soul andfree will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we sprangfrom the apes they say this not at all suspecting that thousands ofyears ago that same law of necessity which with such ardor they are nowtrying to prove by physiology and comparative zoology was not merelyacknowledged by all the religions and all the thinkers but has neverbeen denied they do not see that the role of the natural sciences inthis matter is merely to serve as an instrument for the illumination ofone side of it for the fact that from the point of view ofobservation reason and the will are merely secretions of the brain andthat man following the general law may have developed from lower animalsat some unknown period of time only explains from a fresh side thetruth admitted thousands of years ago by all the religious andphilosophic theoriesthat from the point of view of reason man issubject to the law of necessity but it does not advance by a hairsbreadth the solution of the question which has another opposite sidebased on the consciousness of freedomif men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time that is ascomprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at acertain period of time in the first case the unknown quantity is thetime in the second case it is the origin and the question of howmans consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law ofnecessity to which he is subject cannot be solved by comparativephysiology and zoology for in a frog a rabbit or an ape we canobserve only the muscular nervous activity but in man we observeconsciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activitythe naturalists and their followers thinking they can solve thisquestion are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls of achurch who availing themselves of the absence of the chiefsuperintendent of the work should in an access of zeal plaster over thewindows icons woodwork and still unbuttressed walls and should bedelighted that from their point of view as plasterers everything is nowso smooth and regularfor the solution of the question of free will or inevitability historyhas this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which thequestion is dealt with that for history this question does not refer tothe essence of mans free will but its manifestation in the past andunder certain conditionsin regard to this question history stands to the other sciences asexperimental science stands to abstract sciencethe subject for history is not mans will itself but our presentation ofitand so for history the insoluble mystery presented by theincompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it doesfor theology ethics and philosophy history surveys a presentation ofmans life in which the union of these two contradictions has alreadytaken placein actual life each historic event each human action is very clearlyand definitely understood without any sense of contradiction althougheach event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsoryto solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and whatconstitutes the essence of these two conceptions the philosophy ofhistory can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by othersciences instead of first defining the conceptions of freedom andinevitability in themselves and then ranging the phenomena of lifeunder those definitions history should deduce a definition of theconception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immensequantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appeardependent on these two elementswhatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual wemay consider we always regard it as the result partly of mans freewill and partly of the law of inevitabilitywhether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions ofthe barbarians or of the decrees of napoleon iii or of someonesaction an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for hiswalk we are unconscious of any contradiction the degree of freedom andinevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly definedfor usour conception of the degree of freedom often varies according todifferences in the point of view from which we regard the event butevery human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom andinevitability in every action we examine we see a certain measure offreedom and a certain measure of inevitability and always the morefreedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive andthe more inevitability the less freedomthe proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increasesaccording to the point of view from which the action is regarded buttheir relation is always one of inverse proportiona sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him or a hungry motherexhausted by feeding her baby who steals some food or a man trained todiscipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless manseem less guilty that is less free and more subject to the law ofnecessity to one who knows the circumstances in which these people wereplaced and more free to one who does not know that the man was himselfdrowning that the mother was hungry that the soldier was in the ranksand so on similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago andhas since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guiltyand his action more due to the law of inevitability to someone whoconsiders his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one whoexamined it the day after it was committed and in the same way everyaction of an insane intoxicated or highly excited man appears lessfree and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of himwho committed the action and seems more free and less inevitable to onewho does not know it in all these cases the conception of freedom isincreased or diminished and the conception of compulsion iscorrespondingly decreased or increased according to the point of viewfrom which the action is regarded so that the greater the conception ofnecessity the smaller the conception of freedom and vice versareligion the common sense of mankind the science of jurisprudence andhistory itself understand alike this relation between necessity andfreedomall cases without exception in which our conception of freedom andnecessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations the relation to the external world of the man who commits the deeds his relation to time his relation to the causes leading to the actionthe first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the mansrelation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness ofour understanding of the definite position occupied by the man inrelation to everything coexisting with him this is what makes itevident that a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessitythan one standing on dry ground and that makes the actions of a manclosely connected with others in a thickly populated district or of onebound by family official or business duties seem certainly less freeand more subject to necessity than those of a man living in solitude andseclusionif we consider a man alone apart from his relation to everything aroundhim each action of his seems to us free but if we see his relation toanything around him if we see his connection with anything whateverwith a man who speaks to him a book he reads the work on which he isengaged even with the air he breathes or the light that falls on thethings about himwe see that each of these circumstances has aninfluence on him and controls at least some side of his activity andthe more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of hisfreedom diminishes and the more our conception of the necessity thatweighs on him increasesthe second consideration is the more or less evident time relation ofthe man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the placethe mans action occupies in time that is the ground which makes thefall of the first man resulting in the production of the human raceappear evidently less free than a mans entry into marriage today it isthe reason why the life and activity of people who lived centuries agoand are connected with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the lifeof a contemporary the consequences of which are still unknown to methe degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in thisrespect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performanceof the action and our judgment of itif i examine an act i performed a moment ago in approximately the samecircumstances as those i am in now my action appears to me undoubtedlyfree but if i examine an act performed a month ago then being indifferent circumstances i cannot help recognizing that if that act hadnot been committed much that resulted from itgood agreeable and evenessentialwould not have taken place if i reflect on an action stillmore remote ten years ago or more then the consequences of my actionare still plainer to me and i find it hard to imagine what would havehappened had that action not been performed the farther i go back inmemory or what is the same thing the farther i go forward in myjudgment the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of myactionin history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning thepart played by free will in the general affairs of humanity acontemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all theknown participants but with a more remote event we already see itsinevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possibleand the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary dothey appearthe austroprussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of thecrafty conduct of bismarck and so on the napoleonic wars still seem tous though already questionably to be the outcome of their heroeswill but in the crusades we already see an event occupying its definiteplace in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern historyof europe though to the chroniclers of the crusades that event appearedas merely due to the will of certain people in regard to the migrationof the peoples it does not enter anyones head today to suppose that therenovation of the european world depended on attilas caprice thefarther back in history the object of our observation lies the moredoubtful does the free will of those concerned in the event become andthe more manifest the law of inevitabilitythe third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that endlesschain of causation inevitably demanded by reason in which eachphenomenon comprehended and therefore mans every action must have itsdefinite place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause ofwhat will followthe better we are acquainted with the physiological psychological andhistorical laws deduced by observation and by which man is controlledand the more correctly we perceive the physiological psychological andhistorical causes of the action and the simpler the action we areobserving and the less complex the character and mind of the man inquestion the more subject to inevitability and the less free do ouractions and those of others appearwhen we do not at all understand the cause of an action whether acrime a good action or even one that is simply nonmoral we ascribe agreater amount of freedom to it in the case of a crime we most urgentlydemand the punishment for such an act in the case of a virtuous act werate its merit most highly in an indifferent case we recognize in itmore individuality originality and independence but if even one ofthe innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certainelement of necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crimeor the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act or the freedomof the apparently original action that a criminal was reared among malefactors mitigates his fault in our eyes the selfsacrifice of a fatheror mother or selfsacrifice with the possibility of a reward is morecomprehensible than gratuitous selfsacrifice and therefore seems lessdeserving of sympathy and less the result of free will the founder of asect or party or an inventor impresses us less when we know how or bywhat the way was prepared for his activity if we have a large range ofexamples if our observation is constantly directed to seeking thecorrelation of cause and effect in peoples actions their actionsappear to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly weconnect the effects with the causes if we examined simple actions andhad a vast number of such actions under observation our conception oftheir inevitability would be still greater the dishonest conduct of theson of a dishonest father the misconduct of a woman who had fallen intobad company a drunkards relapse into drunkenness and so on areactions that seem to us less free the better we understand their causeif the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage ofmental development like a child a madman or a simpletonthenknowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character andintelligence in question we see so large an element of necessity and solittle free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the actionwe can foretell the resulton these three considerations alone is based the conception ofirresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admittedby all legislative codes the responsibility appears greater or lessaccording to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances inwhich the man was placed whose action is being judged and according tothe greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of theaction and its investigation and according to the greater or lesserunderstanding of the causes that led to the actionthus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishesor increases according to the greater or lesser connection with theexternal world the greater or lesser remoteness of time and thegreater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which wecontemplate a mans lifeso that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with theexternal world is well known where the time between the action and itsexamination is great and where the causes of the action are mostaccessible we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and aminimum of free will if we examine a man little dependent on externalconditions whose action was performed very recently and the causes ofwhose action are beyond our ken we get the conception of a minimum ofinevitability and a maximum of freedomin neither casehowever we may change our point of view however plainwe may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the externalworld however inaccessible it may be to us however long or short theperiod of time however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes ofthe action may becan we ever conceive either complete freedom orcomplete necessity to whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from theinfluence of the external world we never get a conception of freedom inspace every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surroundshim and by his own body i lift my arm and let it fall my action seemsto me free but asking myself whether i could raise my arm in everydirection i see that i raised it in the direction in which there wasleast obstruction to that action either from things around me or fromthe construction of my own body i chose one out of all the possibledirections because in it there were fewest obstacles for my action tobe free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles toconceive of a man being free we must imagine him outside space which isevidently impossible however much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of thedeed we never get a conception of freedom in time for if i examine anaction committed a second ago i must still recognize it as not beingfree for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it wascommitted can i lift my arm i lift it but ask myself could i haveabstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed toconvince myself of this i do not lift it the next moment but i am notnow abstaining from doing so at the first moment when i asked thequestion time has gone by which i could not detain the arm i thenlifted is no longer the same as the arm i now refrain from lifting noris the air in which i lifted it the same that now surrounds me themoment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable and at thatmoment i could make only one movement and whatever movement i madewould be the only one that i did not lift my arm a moment later doesnot prove that i could have abstained from lifting it then and since icould make only one movement at that single moment of time it could nothave been any other to imagine it as free it is necessary to imagineit in the present on the boundary between the past and the futurethatis outside time which is impossible however much the difficulty of understanding the causes may beincreased we never reach a conception of complete freedom that is anabsence of cause however inaccessible to us may be the cause of theexpression of will in any action our own or anothers the first demandof reason is the assumption of and search for a cause for without acause no phenomenon is conceivable i raise my arm to perform an actionindependently of any cause but my wish to perform an action without acause is the cause of my actionbut even ifimagining a man quite exempt from all influences examiningonly his momentary action in the present unevoked by any causewe wereto admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaledzero we should even then not have arrived at the conception of completefreedom in man for a being uninfluenced by the external world standingoutside of time and independent of cause is no longer a manin the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid offreedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability however we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space inwhich man is situated that knowledge can never be complete for thenumber of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space andtherefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are definedthere is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedomremains however we may prolong the period of time between the action we areexamining and the judgment upon it that period will be finite whiletime is infinite and so in this respect too there can never be absoluteinevitability however accessible may be the chain of causation of any action weshall never know the whole chain since it is endless and so again wenever reach absolute inevitabilitybut besides this even if admitting the remaining minimum of freedom toequal zero we assumed in some given caseas for instance in that of adying man an unborn babe or an idiotcomplete absence of freedom byso doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we areexamining for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man andso the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law ofinevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible asthe conception of a mans completely free actionand so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law ofinevitability without any freedom we must assume the knowledge of aninfinite number of space relations an infinitely long period of timeand an infinite series of causesto imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law ofinevitability we must imagine him all alone beyond space beyond timeand free from dependence on causein the first case if inevitability were possible without freedom weshould have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws ofinevitability itself that is a mere form without contentin the second case if freedom were possible without inevitability weshould have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space time andcause which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited wouldbe nothing or mere content without formwe should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which manswhole outlook on the universe is constructedthe incomprehensibleessence of life and the laws defining that essencereason says  space with all the forms of matter that give itvisibility is infinite and cannot be imagined otherwise  time isinfinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise the connection between cause and effect has no beginning and canhave no endconsciousness says  i alone am and all that exists is but meconsequently i include space  i measure flowing time by the fixedmoment of the present in which alone i am conscious of myself as livingconsequently i am outside time  i am beyond cause for i feel myselfto be the cause of every manifestation of my lifereason gives expression to the laws of inevitability consciousnessgives expression to the essence of freedomfreedom not limited by anything is the essence of life in mansconsciousness inevitability without content is mans reason in itsthree formsfreedom is the thing examined inevitability is what examines freedomis the content inevitability is the formonly by separating the two sources of cognition related to one anotheras form to content do we get the mutually exclusive and separatelyincomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitabilityonly by uniting them do we get a clear conception of mans lifeapart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define oneanother as form and content no conception of life is possibleall that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation of freewill to inevitability that is of consciousness to the laws of reasonall that we know of the external world of nature is only a certainrelation of the forces of nature to inevitability or of the essence oflife to the laws of reasonthe great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious ofthem we call those forces gravitation inertia electricity animalforce and so on but we are conscious of the force of life in man andwe call that freedombut just as the force of gravitation incomprehensible in itself butfelt by every man is understood by us only to the extent to which weknow the laws of inevitability to which it is subject from the firstknowledge that all bodies have weight up to newtons law so too theforce of free will incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone isconscious is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws ofinevitability to which it is subject from the fact that every man diesup to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic lawsall knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under thelaws of reasonmans free will differs from every other force in that man is directlyconscious of it but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from anyother force the forces of gravitation electricity or chemicalaffinity are only distinguished from one another in that they aredifferently defined by reason just so the force of mans free will isdistinguished by reason from the other forces of nature only by thedefinition reason gives it freedom apart from necessity that isapart from the laws of reason that define it differs in no way fromgravitation or heat or the force that makes things grow for reasonit is only a momentary undefinable sensation of lifeand as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodiesthe undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity or ofchemical affinity or of the vital force forms the content ofastronomy physics chemistry botany zoology and so on just in thesame way does the force of free will form the content of history butjust as the subject of every science is the manifestation of thisunknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be thesubject of metaphysics even the manifestation of the force of free willin human beings in space in time and in dependence on cause forms thesubject of history while free will itself is the subject ofmetaphysicsin the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws ofinevitability what is unknown to us we call vital force vital force isonly an expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we knowof the essence of lifeso also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitabilitywhat is unknown we call free will free will is for history only anexpression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws ofhuman lifehistory examines the manifestations of mans free will in connectionwith the external world in time and in dependence on cause that is itdefines this freedom by the laws of reason and so history is a scienceonly in so far as this free will is defined by those lawsthe recognition of mans free will as something capable of influencinghistorical events that is as not subject to laws is the same forhistory as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodieswould be for astronomythat assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of lawsthat is of any science whatever if there is even a single body movingfreely then the laws of kepler and newton are negatived and noconception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists ifany single action is due to free will then not a single historical lawcan exist nor any conception of historical eventsfor history lines exist of the movement of human wills one end ofwhich is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which aconsciousness of mans will in the present moves in space time anddependence on causethe more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes the moreevident are the laws of that movement to discover and define those lawsis the problem of historyfrom the standpoint from which the science of history now regards itssubject on the path it now follows seeking the causes of events inmans freewill a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossiblefor however mans free will may be restricted as soon as we recognizeit as a force not subject to law the existence of law becomesimpossibleonly by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal thatis by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity can we convinceourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes and theninstead of seeking causes history will take the discovery of laws asits problemthe search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods ofthought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneouslywith the selfdestruction toward whichever dissecting and dissectingthe causes of phenomenathe old method of history is movingall human sciences have traveled along that path arriving atinfinitesimals mathematics the most exact of sciences abandons theprocess of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration ofunknown infinitely small quantities abandoning the conception ofcause mathematics seeks law that is the property common to allunknown infinitely small elementsin another form but along the same path of reflection the other scienceshave proceeded when newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not saythat the sun or the earth had a property of attraction he said that allbodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attractingone another that is leaving aside the question of the cause of themovement of the bodies he expressed the property common to all bodiesfrom the infinitely large to the infinitely small the same is done bythe natural sciences leaving aside the question of cause they seek forlaws history stands on the same path and if history has for its objectthe study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not thenarration of episodes in the lives of individuals it too setting asidethe conception of cause should seek the laws common to all theinseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements of free willfrom the time the law of copernicus was discovered and proved the mererecognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that movessufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the ancients by disprovingthat law it might have been possible to retain the old conception of themovements of the bodies but without disproving it it would seemimpossible to continue studying the ptolemaic worlds but even after thediscovery of the law of copernicus the ptolemaic worlds were stillstudied for a long timefrom the time the first person said and proved that the number of birthsor of crimes is subject to mathematical laws and that this or that modeof government is determined by certain geographical and economicconditions and that certain relations of population to soil producemigrations of peoples the foundations on which history had been builtwere destroyed in their essenceby refuting these new laws the former view of history might have beenretained but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continuestudying historic events as the results of mans free will for if acertain mode of government was established or certain migrations ofpeoples took place in consequence of such and such geographicethnographic or economic conditions then the free will of thoseindividuals who appear to us to have established that mode of governmentor occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the causeand yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with thelaws of statistics geography political economy comparative philologyand geology which directly contradict its assumptionsthe struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornlyfought out in physical philosophy theology stood on guard for the oldviews and accused the new of violating revelation but when truthconquered theology established itself just as firmly on the newfoundationjust as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding betweenthe old and the new conception of history and theology in the same waystands on guard for the old view and accuses the new view of subvertingrevelationin the one case as in the other on both sides the struggle provokespassion and stifles truth on the one hand there is fear and regret forthe loss of the whole edifice constructed through the ages on the otheris the passion for destructionto the men who fought against the rising truths of physical philosophyit seemed that if they admitted that truth it would destroy faith ingod in the creation of the firmament and in the miracle of joshua theson of nun to the defenders of the laws of copernicus and newton tovoltaire for example it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyedreligion and he utilized the law of gravitation as a weapon againstreligionjust so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law ofinevitability to destroy the conception of the soul of good and eviland all the institutions of state and church that have been built up onthose conceptionsso too like voltaire in his time uninvited defenders of the law ofinevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion thoughthe law of inevitability in history like the law of copernicus inastronomy far from destroying even strengthens the foundation on whichthe institutions of state and church are erectedas in the question of astronomy then so in the question of history nowthe whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition ornonrecognition of something absolute serving as the measure of visiblephenomena in astronomy it was the immovability of the earth in historyit is the independence of personalityfree willas with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earthlay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earths fixity and ofthe motion of the planets so in history the difficulty of recognizingthe subjection of personality to the laws of space time and cause liesin renouncing the direct feeling of the independence of ones ownpersonality but as in astronomy the new view said it is true that wedo not feel the movement of the earth but by admitting its immobilitywe arrive at absurdity while by admitting its motion which we do notfeel we arrive at laws so also in history the new view says it istrue that we are not conscious of our dependence but by admitting ourfree will we arrive at absurdity while by admitting our dependence onthe external world on time and on cause we arrive at lawsin the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness of anunreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did not feel inthe present case it is similarly necessary to renounce a freedom thatdoes not exist and to recognize a dependence of which we are notconscious
